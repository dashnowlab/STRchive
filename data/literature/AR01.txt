TI  - Androgen receptor CAG repeat polymorphism might be a possible cause of familial 
      constitutional delay of growth and puberty.
LID - 10.1007/s40618-024-02502-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Induction of puberty in boys with constitutional delay of growth and 
      puberty (CDGP) through a short course of low-dose testosterone therapy indicates 
      the critical interaction between testosterone and the androgen receptor (AR) 
      during the activation and maturation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis 
      at puberty onset. Previous studies have shown an inverse relationship between the 
      CAG repeat length and the transactivation function or expression level of the AR 
      gene. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate whether the AR CAG repeat polymorphism 
      has any implications on pubertal delay. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Thirty-three male 
      patients with CDGP were enrolled in the study group, while 53 age-matched healthy 
      individuals who had entered puberty on time were included in the control group. 
      The CAG repeat length was determined through direct DNA sequencing analysis. 
      RESULTS: The median chronological age of boys with CDGP was 14.2 (14.1-14.6) 
      years, compared to 14.2 (13.65-14.8) years for healthy subjects (p = 0.5). In the 
      CDGP group, 22 (66.7%) children had a family history of the condition. There was 
      no significant difference between the groups in terms of AR CAG repeat length 
      (median AR CAG repeat length: 21 (20-24.5) and 20 (20-24), respectively, 
      p = 0.1). However, in boys with CDGP with a similar family history (n = 22), a 
      significantly longer AR CAG repeat length was found compared to the control group 
      (n = 53) (median AR CAG repeat length: 22 (20-25) and 20 (20-24), respectively, 
      p = 0.03). The median AR CAG repeat length in boys without a family history was 
      21 (20-22) triplets. Although boys with a family history had a slightly longer AR 
      CAG repeat length than those without, the difference was not statistically 
      significant (p = 0.07). Additionally, no significant differences were observed 
      between boys with non-familial CDGP and control subjects (p = 0.8). Furthermore, 
      no significant differences in anthropometric characteristics or hormonal 
      parameters were found when patients with CDGP were categorized by AR CAG repeat 
      length quartiles. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to investigate the role of 
      AR CAG polymorphism in the etiopathogenesis of CDGP. Our findings suggest that 
      the AR CAG repeat length may be associated with familial CDGP.

TI  - Expanded carrier screening for inherited genetic disease using exome and genome 
      sequencing.
LID - 10.1002/jgc4.1964 [doi]
AB  - The goal of this study was to assess the feasibility of using exome (ES) and 
      genome sequencing (GS) in guiding preconception genetic screening (PCGS) for 
      couples who are planning to conceive by creating a workflow for identifying risk 
      alleles for autosomal recessive (AR) and X-linked (XL) disorders without the 
      constraints of a predetermined, targeted gene panel. There were several 
      limitations and challenges related to reporting and the technical aspects of ES 
      and GS, which are listed in the discussion. We selected 150 couples from a cohort 
      of families (trios) enrolled in a research protocol where the goal was to define 
      the genetic etiology of disease in an affected child. Pre-existing, de-identified 
      parental sequencing data were analyzed to define variants that would place the 
      couple at risk of having a child affected by an AR or XL disorder. We identified 
      17 families who would be selected for counseling about risk alleles. We noted 
      that only 3 of these at-risk couples would be identified if we limited ourselves 
      to the current ACMG-recommended expanded carrier screening gene panel. ES and GS 
      successfully identified couples who are at risk of having a child with a rare AR 
      or XL disorder that would have been missed by the current recommended guidelines. 
      Current limitations of this approach include ethical concerns, difficulties in 
      reporting results including variant calling due to the rare nature of some of the 
      variants, determining which disorders to report, as well as technical 
      difficulties in detecting certain variants such as repeat expansions.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the frequency 
      and relative importance of symptoms experienced by patients with spinal and 
      bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 
      232 participants with SBMA. Participants provided input regarding 18 themes and 
      208 symptoms that affect patients with SBMA. Participants were asked about the 
      relative importance of each symptom, and analysis was conducted to determine how 
      age, education, disease duration, CAG repeat length, and ambulation status relate 
      to symptom prevalence. RESULTS: Hip, thigh, or knee weakness (96.5%), fatigue 
      (96.5%), problems with hands and fingers (95.7%), and limitations with walking 
      (95.7%) were the themes with the highest prevalence in the study population. 
      Ambulatory status was associated with the prevalence of 9 of the 14 themes, and 
      CAG repeat length and education were each associated with 4 of 14 themes. The 
      prevalence of fatigue was reduced in those with a lower CAG repeat length and 
      increased with a longer disease duration. Younger patients reported a higher 
      prevalence of emotional issues. DISCUSSION: There are a diversity of themes that 
      are important to patients with SBMA. These themes have a variable level of 
      importance to the population with SBMA and represent clinically meaningful 
      outcome measures for future therapeutic interventions.

TI  - Mutant androgen receptor induces neurite loss and senescence independently of ARE

AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a slowly progressing neuromuscular 
      disease caused by a polyglutamine (polyQ)-encoding CAG trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion in the androgen receptor (AR) gene, leading to AR aggregation, lower 
      motor neuron death, and muscle atrophy. AR is a ligand-activated transcription 
      factor that regulates neuronal architecture and promotes axon regeneration; 
      however, whether AR transcriptional functions contribute to disease pathogenesis 
      is not fully understood. Using a differentiated PC12 cell model of SBMA, we 
      identified dysfunction of polyQ-expanded AR in its regulation of neurite growth 
      and maintenance. Specifically, we found that in the presence of androgens, 
      polyQ-expanded AR inhibited neurite outgrowth, induced neurite retraction, and 
      inhibited neurite regrowth. This dysfunction was independent of polyQ-expanded AR 
      transcriptional activity at androgen response elements (ARE). We further showed 
      that the formation of polyQ-expanded AR intranuclear inclusions promoted neurite 
      retraction, which coincided with reduced expression of the neuronal 
      differentiation marker beta-III-Tubulin. Finally, we revealed that cell death is not 
      the primary outcome for cells undergoing neurite retraction; rather, these cells 
      become senescent. Our findings reveal that mechanisms independent of AR canonical 
      transcriptional activity underly neurite defects in a cell model of SBMA and 
      identify senescence as a pathway implicated in this pathology. These findings 
      suggest that in the absence of a role for AR canonical transcriptional activity 
      in the SBMA pathologies described here, the development of SBMA therapeutics that 
      preserve this activity may be desirable. This approach may be broadly applicable 
      to other polyglutamine diseases such as Huntington's disease and spinocerebellar 
      ataxias.

PG  - 494-499
LID - 10.1111/cge.14565 [doi]
AB  - Variants in more than 60 different genes, most of which code for podocyte-related 
      proteins, have been found to be associated with monogenic forms of nephrotic 
      syndrome (NS). Biallelic variants in DAAM2, a member of the formin family, were 
      recently identified to cause autosomal recessive (AR) NS type 24 in four 
      unrelated families with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS). This case 
      report represents only the fifth reported family of DAAM2-associated NS and the 
      first from India, with two sibs who presented with a complex phenotype 
      characterized by steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, short stature, dysmorphic 
      facial features, deep-set toenails, myopia, increased thickness of the calvarium 
      of the skull, and sloping ribs. Both sibs were found to have a homozygous likely 
      pathogenic nonsense variant c.196C>T (p.Arg66Ter; NM_001201427.2) in exon 3 of 
      the DAAM2 gene through whole exome sequencing. The dysmorphic features could 
      possibly be part of the DAAM2-related phenotype which has hitherto not been 
      reported or could represent a blended phenotype, with the extrarenal 
      manifestations resulting from a yet to be identified coexisting genetic 
      condition.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Androgen resistance syndrome or androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS 
      - Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome, OMIM 300068) is an X-linked recessive genetic 
      syndrome causing disorders of sexual development in males. This disease is caused 
      by mutations in the AR gene located on the X chromosome, which encodes the 
      protein that structures the androgen receptor, with the role of receiving 
      androgens. Mutation of the AR gene causes complete or partial loss of androgen 
      receptor function, thereby androgen not being obtained and exerting its effect on 
      target organs, resulting in abnormalities of the male reproductive system due to 
      this organ system, differentiating towards feminization under the influence of 
      estrogen. Disease prevention can be achieved by using pre-implantation genetic 
      diagnosis, which enables couples carrying the mutation to have healthy offspring. 
      AIM: To carry out preimplantation genetic diagnosis of androgen resistance 
      syndrome. METHODS: Sanger sequencing was used to detect the mutation in the blood 
      samples of the couple, their son, and 01 embryo that were biopsied on the fifth 
      day based on the findings of next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the affected 
      son. We combined Sanger sequencing and linkage analysis using short tandem 
      repeats (STR) to provide diagnostic results. RESULTS: We performed 
      preimplantation genetic diagnosis for AIS on an embryo from a couple who had 
      previously had an affected son. Consequently, one healthy embryo was diagnosed 
      without the variant NM_000044: c.796del (p.Asp266IlefsTer30). CONCLUSION: We 
      report on a novel variant (NM_000044: c.796del (p.Asp266IlefsTer30)) in the AR 
      gene discovered in Vietnam. The developed protocol was helpful for the 
      preimplantation genetic diagnosis process to help families with the monogenic 
      disease of AIS but wish to have healthy children.

TI  - The Influence of Trinucleotide Repeats in the Androgen Receptor Gene on 
      Androgen-related Traits and Diseases.

LID - 10.1210/clinem/dgae302 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Trinucleotide repeats in the androgen receptor have been proposed to 
      influence testosterone signaling in men, but the clinical relevance of these 
      trinucleotide repeats remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: To examine how androgen 
      receptor trinucleotide repeat lengths affect androgen-related traits and disease 
      risks and whether they influence the clinical importance of circulating 
      testosterone levels. METHODS: We quantified CAG and GGC repeat lengths in the 
      androgen receptor (AR) gene of European-ancestry male participants in the UK 
      Biobank from whole-genome and whole-exome sequence data using ExpansionHunter and 
      tested associations with androgen-related traits and diseases. We also examined 
      whether the associations between testosterone levels and these outcomes were 
      affected by adjustment for the repeat lengths. RESULTS: We successfully 
      quantified the repeat lengths from whole-genome and/or whole-exome sequence data 
      in 181 217 males. Both repeat lengths were shown to be positively associated with 
      circulating total testosterone level and bone mineral density, whereas CAG repeat 
      length was negatively associated with male-pattern baldness, but their effects 
      were relatively small and were not associated with most of the other outcomes. 
      Circulating total testosterone level was associated with various outcomes, but 
      this relationship was not affected by adjustment for the repeat lengths. 
      CONCLUSION: In this large-scale study, we found that longer CAG and GGC repeats 
      in the AR gene influence androgen resistance, elevate circulating testosterone 
      level via a feedback loop, and play a role in some androgen-targeted tissues. 
      Generally, however, circulating testosterone level is a more important 
      determinant of androgen action in males than repeat lengths.

AB  - Genetic repeat expansions cause neuronal degeneration in amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis as well as other neurodegenerative disorders such as spinocerebellar 
      ataxia, Huntington's disease and Kennedy's disease. Repeat expansions in the same 
      gene can cause multiple clinical phenotypes. We aimed to characterize repeat 
      expansions in a Norwegian amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cohort. Norwegian 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients (n = 414) and neurologically healthy 
      controls adjusted for age and gender (n = 713) were investigated for repeat 
      expansions in AR, ATXN1, ATXN2 and HTT using short read exome sequencing and the 
      ExpansionHunter software. Five amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients (1.2%) and 
      two controls (0.3%) carried >/=36 repeats in HTT (P = 0.032), and seven amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis patients (1.7%) and three controls (0.4%) carried >/=29 repeats 
      in ATXN2 (P = 0.038). One male diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
      carried a pathogenic repeat expansion in AR, and his diagnosis was revised to 
      Kennedy's disease. In ATXN1, 50 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients (12.1%) 
      and 96 controls (13.5%) carried >/=33 repeats (P = 0.753). None of the patients 
      with repeat expansions in ATXN2 or HTT had signs of Huntington's disease or 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2, based on a re-evaluation of medical records. The 
      diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis was confirmed in all patients, with 
      the exception of one patient who had primary lateral sclerosis. Our findings 
      indicate that repeat expansions in HTT and ATXN2 are associated with increased 
      likelihood of developing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Further studies are 
      required to investigate the potential relationship between HTT repeat expansions 
      and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

TI  - A phenotypically robust model of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy in 
      Drosophila.
PG  - e25278
LID - 10.1002/jnr.25278 [doi]
AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an X-linked disorder that affects 
      males who inherit the androgen receptor (AR) gene with an abnormal CAG triplet 
      repeat expansion. The resulting protein contains an elongated polyglutamine 
      (polyQ) tract and causes motor neuron degeneration in an androgen-dependent 
      manner. The precise molecular sequelae of SBMA are unclear. To assist with its 
      investigation and the identification of therapeutic options, we report here a new 
      model of SBMA in Drosophila melanogaster. We generated transgenic flies that 
      express the full-length, human AR with a wild-type or pathogenic polyQ repeat. 
      Each transgene is inserted into the same safe harbor site on the third chromosome 
      of the fly as a single copy and in the same orientation. Expression of pathogenic 
      AR, but not of its wild-type variant, in neurons or muscles leads to consistent, 
      progressive defects in longevity and motility that are concomitant with 
      polyQ-expanded AR protein aggregation and reduced complexity in neuromuscular 
      junctions. Additional assays show adult fly eye abnormalities associated with the 
      pathogenic AR species. The detrimental effects of pathogenic AR are accentuated 
      by feeding flies the androgen, dihydrotestosterone. This new, robust SBMA model 
      can be a valuable tool toward future investigations of this incurable disease.

TI  - The Impact of Medicaid Expansion Under the Affordable Care Act on the Gap Between 
      American Indians and Whites in Breast Cancer Management and Prognosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) death rates in the USA have not significantly 
      declined for American Indians (AIs) in comparison to Whites. Our objective was to 
      determine whether Medicaid Expansion as part of the Affordable Care Act led to 
      improved BC outcomes for AIs relative to Whites. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the 
      National Cancer Database, we conducted a retrospective cohort study. Included 
      were BC patients who were AI and White; 40 to 64 years of age; diagnosed in 2009 
      to 2016; lived in states that expanded Medicaid in January 2014, and states that 
      did not expand Medicaid. Our outcomes were stage at diagnosis, insurance status, 
      timely treatment, and 3-year mortality. RESULTS: There were 359,484 newly 
      diagnosed BC patients, 99.49% White, 0.51% AI. Uninsured rates declined more in 
      the expansion states than in the nonexpansion states (OR = 0.44, 95% CI: 
      0.15-0.97, P < 0.001). Lower rates of Stage I BC diagnosis was found in AIs 
      compared to Whites (46.58% vs. 55.33%, P < .001); these differential rates did 
      not change after Medicaid expansion. Rates of definitive treatment initiation 
      within 30 days of diagnosis declined after Medicaid expansion (P < .001); there 
      was a smaller decline in the expansion states (OR 1.118, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.15, P < 
      .001). Three year mortality was not different between expansion and nonexpansion 
      states post Medicaid expansion. CONCLUSIONS: In newly diagnosed BCs, uninsured 
      rates declined more in the states that expanded Medicaid in January 2014. Timely 
      treatment post Medicaid expansion declined less in states that expanded Medicaid. 
      There was no differential benefit of Medicaid expansion in the 2 races.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To study whether CAG repeat polymorphism of androgen receptor (AR) 
      contributes to the risk of polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) with antral 
      follicle count (AFC) >/= 20 in the context of new international guideline of 
      polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). METHODS: Blood of 109 PCOS cases and 61 
      controls were collected for the measurement of AR CAG repeats length by 
      sequencing. The mean number and frequency distribution of CAG repeats length were 
      observed. Detailed analysis was conducted by dividing PCOS cases into low AFC 
      group (L-AFC, AFC < 20) and high AFC group (H-AFC, AFC >/= 20) according to the new 
      international evidence-based guideline. RESULTS: The portion of individuals with 
      lower CAG repeats length in H-AFC group was significantly larger than those with 
      higher CAG repeats length. Logistic model revealed individuals with lower CAG 
      length tended to develop H-AFC. CONCLUSION: Lower CAG repeats length in the AR 
      gene of PCOS cases increases risk of PCOM.

AB  - DESIGN: The androgen receptor (AR) mediates peripheral effects of testosterone. 
      Previous data suggests an association between the number of CAG repeats in exon-1 
      of the AR gene and AR transcriptional activity. The aim of this analysis was to 
      determine the association between the number of AR CAG repeats and all-cause 
      mortality in men and the influence of testosterone level on the association. 
      PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS: Follow-up data to 27 January 2018 were available for 
      men aged 40-79 years recruited across six countries of the European Male Aging 
      Study between 2003 and 2005. Cox proportional hazards modelling was used to 
      determine the association between CAG repeat number/mortality. Results were 
      expressed as hazard ratios (HR)/95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: One 
      thousand nine hundred and seventy-seven men were followed up. Mean baseline age 
      was 60 +/- 11.1 years. Mean duration of follow-up was 12.2 years. At follow up 
      25.1% of men had died. CAG repeat length ranged from 6 to 39, with the highest 
      proportion of CAG repeat number at 21 repeats (16.4%). In a multivariable model, 
      compared to men with 22-23 AR CAG repeats: for men with <22 and >23 AR CAG HR, 
      95% CI for mortality were, <22 CAG repeats 1.17 (0.93-1.49) and >23 CAG repeats 
      1.14 (0.88-1.47). In a post-hoc analysis, the association was significant for men 
      in the lowest tertile of baseline testosterone (<14.2 nmol/L) with >23 CAG 
      repeats: in the adjusted model for <22 and >23 CAG repeats, respectively, 1.49 
      (0.97-2.27) and 1.68 (1.06-2.67) versus 22-23 repeats. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      European-wide cohort data overall found no association of androgen receptor CAG 
      repeat number and mortality in men. However, post hoc analysis suggested that an 
      association might be present in men with lower baseline testosterone 
      concentrations, which merits further investigation.

LID - 10.1111/echo.15690 [doi]
AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a rare X-linked recessive 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by the excessive expansion of 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine repeat sequences in the androgen receptor gene encoded 
      on the Xq11-12 chromosome. SBMA primarily affects adult males and is 
      characterized by weakness and atrophy of the proximal limb muscles, often 
      involving the bulbar muscles. In addition to neuromuscular deficits, nonneuronal 
      symptoms such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and liver dysfunction are often 
      observed in patients with SBMA. Previous studies have suggested that SBMA 
      patients have been diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), while gene 
      detection is lacked. Moreover, according to current reports, SBMA patients can 
      carry Brugada syndrome or HCM respectively, while three kinds of diseases have 
      not been reported to exist in the same patient. Here, we report the first case of 
      a male diagnosed with SBMA combined with HCM and two types of Brugada-pattern 
      electrocardiographic changes, with a heterozygous missense mutation in the TTN 
      gene.

      maxillary atresia due to or not due to allergic rhinitis.

AB  - AIM: To evaluate the effects of rapid maxillary expansion (RME) on nasal patency 
      in mouth breathing (MB) children with maxillary atresia due to or not due to 
      allergic rhinitis (AR) associated with asthma. METHODS: Fifty-three MB 
      children/adolescents (aged 7-14 years) with mixed or permanent dentition and 
      maxillary atresia participated, with or without unilateral or bilateral 
      crossbite. They formed the groups: RAD (AR + asthma; clinical treatment, RME); 
      RAC (AR + asthma; clinical treatment, no RME); and D (mouth breathers; RME only). 
      RAD and RAC patients received topical nasal corticosteroid and/or systemic H1 
      antihistamine (continuous use) and environmental exposure control. All were 
      evaluated before RME (T1) and 6 months after (T2) with the CARATkids score, 
      acoustic rhinometry, and nasal cavity computed tomography (CT). Patients RAD and 
      D underwent RME (Hyrax(R) orthopedic appliance). RESULTS: A significant reduction 
      in the CARATkids score occurred in the RAD (-4.06; p < 0.05), similarly when 
      patient and parent/guardian scores were evaluated (-3.28 and -3.16, 
      respectively). Acoustic rhinometry (V5) showed increased nasal volume in all 
      groups, significantly higher in RAD patients than in RAC and D (0.99 x 0.71 x 
      0.69 cm(3), respectively). CT of the nasal cavity documented increased volume in 
      all three groups, with no significant differences between them. CONCLUSION: In MB 
      patients with AR, asthma, and maxillary atresia, RME increased nasal cavity 
      volume and improved respiratory symptoms. However, it should not be used as the 
      only treatment for managing patients with respiratory allergies.

AB  - X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA; Kennedy's disease) is a rare 
      neuromuscular disorder characterized by adult-onset proximal muscle weakness and 
      lower motor neuron degeneration. SBMA was the first human disease found to be 
      caused by a repeat expansion mutation, as affected patients possess an expanded 
      tract of CAG repeats, encoding polyglutamine, in the androgen receptor (AR) gene. 
      We previously developed a conditional BAC fxAR121 transgenic mouse model of SBMA 
      and used it to define a primary role for skeletal muscle expression of 
      polyglutamine-expanded AR in causing the motor neuron degeneration. Here we 
      sought to extend our understanding of SBMA disease pathophysiology and cellular 
      basis by detailed examination and directed experimentation with the BAC fxAR121 
      mice. First, we evaluated BAC fxAR121 mice for non-neurological disease 
      phenotypes recently described in human SBMA patients, and documented prominent 
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, cardiomegaly, and ventricular heart wall 
      thinning in aged male BAC fxAR121 mice. Our discovery of significant hepatic and 
      cardiac abnormalities in SBMA mice underscores the need to evaluate human SBMA 
      patients for signs of liver and heart disease. To directly examine the 
      contribution of motor neuron-expressed polyQ-AR protein to SBMA 
      neurodegeneration, we crossed BAC fxAR121 mice with two different lines of 
      transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase in motor neurons, and after updating 
      characterization of SBMA phenotypes in our current BAC fxAR121 colony, we found 
      that excision of mutant AR from motor neurons did not rescue neuromuscular or 
      systemic disease. These findings further validate a primary role for skeletal 
      muscle as the driver of SBMA motor neuronopathy and indicate that therapies being 
      developed to treat patients should be delivered peripherally.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to study the accuracy of pedicle screw (PS) 
      insertion into dysplastic pedicles in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) 
      comparing cannulated screw using the pedicle expansion technique (PET) versus 
      conventional technique. METHODS: Forty-two AIS patients with 766 PSs were 
      evaluated. In total, 236 screws were inserted into dysplastic pedicles: 138 and 
      98 screws were inserted using the PET (PET group) and standard technique 
      (conventional group), respectively. Both methods used CT-based navigation to 
      determine the insertion point. In the PET, a rigid ball tip feeler was tapped 
      with a mallet to create an insertion route, a guide wire was passed through the 
      tap, the pedicle was enlarged, and then a cannulated PS with a diameter of 
      4.35 mm was inserted. Postoperative CT was used to compare the accuracy of PS 
      insertion. RESULTS: In total, 23/236 (9.7%) perforations occurred. Regarding 
      overall perforation, there were six (4.3%) and 17 (17.3%) cases in the PET and 
      conventional group, respectively (P = 0.008). In terms of medial perforation, the 
      PET group (n = 2, 1.4%) was significantly better than the conventional group 
      (n = 7, 7.1%) (P = 0.021). In terms of lateral perforation, the PET group (n = 4, 
      2.9%) was significantly better than conventional group (n = 10, 10.2%) 
      (P = 0.030). Only grade 1 perforation had occurred in the PET group, whereas 
      grades 2 and 3 perforation occurred in the conventional group. CONCLUSION: Use of 
      the PET with CT-based navigation significantly increased the accuracy and safety 
      of PS insertion in dysplastic pedicles in AIS.

TI  - Differential expression of the androgen receptor gene is correlated with CAG 
      polymorphic repeats in patients with prostate cancer.
LID - 23 [pii]
AB  - Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common types of cancer in men. The 
      aetiology of the disease is not well established, but it has been related to one 
      of the main pathways of regulation of prostate proliferation, mediated by 
      androgens. The androgen receptor (AR) gene encodes the androgen-receptor protein, 
      which functions as a transactivation factor for steroid hormones. It has been 
      proposed that the AR gene transcription levels are mediated by short tandem 
      repeats corresponding to the CAG sequence. However, there are conflicting results 
      in this relationship. We evaluated the expression levels of the AR gene and 
      identified the number of CAG repeats (CAG(n)) in the Mexican population, 
      establishing the relationship between expression levels and increase in the 
      number of CAG repeats. We evaluated the expression levels of AR in tissue samples 
      of PCa and benign prostate disease, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia, or 
      prostatitis, to determine the difference in their expression levels. Our results 
      showed a statistically insignificant underexpression of 0.64-fold decrease in AR 
      levels of PCa patients compared to benign prostate disease patients (P = 0.623) 
      and suggest that the number of CAGn was correlated with the relative expression 
      of the AR gene (P = 0.009) and this correlation was positive, moderate, and 
      proportional (rho = 0.467) and no correlation was found between CAG(n) with other 
      clinical features.

TI  - Unexpected frequency of the pathogenic AR CAG repeat expansion in the general 
      population.
PG  - 2723-2729
LID - 10.1093/brain/awad050 [doi]
AB  - CAG repeat expansions in exon 1 of the AR gene on the X chromosome cause spinal 
      and bulbar muscular atrophy, a male-specific progressive neuromuscular disorder 
      associated with a variety of extra-neurological symptoms. The disease has a 
      reported male prevalence of approximately 1:30 000 or less, but the AR repeat 
      expansion frequency is unknown. We established a pipeline, which combines the use 
      of the ExpansionHunter tool and visual validation, to detect AR CAG expansion on 
      whole-genome sequencing data, benchmarked it to fragment PCR sizing, and applied 
      it to 74 277 unrelated individuals from four large cohorts. Our pipeline showed 
      sensitivity of 100% [95% confidence interval (CI) 90.8-100%], specificity of 99% 
      (95% CI 94.2-99.7%), and a positive predictive value of 97.4% (95% CI 
      84.4-99.6%). We found the mutation frequency to be 1:3182 (95% CI 1:2309-1:4386, 
      n = 117 734) X chromosomes-10 times more frequent than the reported disease 
      prevalence. Modelling using the novel mutation frequency led to estimate disease 
      prevalence of 1:6887 males, more than four times more frequent than the reported 
      disease prevalence. This discrepancy is possibly due to underdiagnosis of this 
      neuromuscular condition, reduced penetrance, and/or pleomorphic clinical 
      manifestations.

TI  - Bicalutamide and Trehalose Ameliorate Spinal and Bulbar Muscular Atrophy 
      Pathology in Mice.
PG  - 524-545
LID - 10.1007/s13311-023-01343-x [doi]
AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is characterized by motor neuron (MN) 
      degeneration that leads to slowly progressive muscle weakness. It is considered a 
      neuromuscular disease since muscle has a primary role in disease onset and 
      progression. SBMA is caused by a CAG triplet repeat expansion in the androgen 
      receptor (AR) gene. The translated poly-glutamine (polyQ) tract confers a toxic 
      gain of function to the mutant AR altering its folding, causing its aggregation 
      into intracellular inclusions, and impairing the autophagic flux. In an in vitro 
      SBMA neuronal model, we previously showed that the antiandrogen bicalutamide and 
      trehalose, a natural disaccharide stimulating autophagy, block ARpolyQ 
      activation, reduce its nuclear translocation and toxicity and facilitate the 
      autophagic degradation of cytoplasmic AR aggregates. Here, in a knock-in SBMA 
      mouse model (KI AR113Q), we show that bicalutamide and trehalose ameliorated SBMA 
      pathology. Bicalutamide reversed the formation of the AR insoluble forms in KI 
      AR113Q muscle, preventing autophagic flux blockage. We demonstrated that 
      apoptosis is activated in KI AR113Q muscle, and that both compounds prevented its 
      activation. We detected a decrease of mtDNA and an increase of OXPHOS enzymes, 
      already at early symptomatic stages; these alterations were reverted by 
      trehalose. Overall, bicalutamide and/or trehalose led to a partial recovery of 
      muscle morphology and function, and improved SBMA mouse motor behavior, inducing 
      an extension of their survival. Thus, bicalutamide and trehalose, by 
      counteracting ARpolyQ toxicity in skeletal muscle, are valuable candidates for 
      future clinical trials in SBMA patients.

AB  - Short Tandem Repeats (STRs) have been found to play a role in a myriad of complex 
      traits and genetic diseases. We examined the variability in the lengths of over 
      850,000 STR loci in 996 children with suspected genetic disorders and 1,178 
      parents across six separate ancestral groups: Africans, Europeans, East Asians, 
      Admixed Americans, Non-admixed Americans, and Pacific Islanders. For each STR 
      locus we compared allele length between and within each ancestry group. In 
      relation to Europeans, admixed Americans had the most similar STR lengths with 
      only 623 positions either significantly expanded or contracted, while the 
      divergence was highest in Africans, with 4,933 chromosomal positions contracted 
      or expanded. We also examined probands to identify STR expansions at known 
      pathogenic loci. The genes TCF4, AR, and DMPK showed significant expansions with 
      lengths 250% greater than their various average allele lengths in 49, 162, and 11 
      individuals respectively. All 49 individuals containing an expansion in TCF4 and 
      six individuals containing an expansion in DMPK presented with allele lengths 
      longer than the known pathogenic length for these genes. Next, we identified 
      individuals with significant expansions in highly conserved loci across all 
      ancestries. Eighty loci in conserved regions met criteria for divergence. Two of 
      these individuals were found to have exonic STR expansions: one in ZBTB4 and the 
      other in SLC9A7, which is associated with X-linked mental retardation. Finally, 
      we used parent-child trios to detect and analyze de novo mutations. In total, we 
      observed 3,219 de novo expansions, where proband allele lengths are greater than 
      twice the longest parental allele length. This work helps lay the foundation for 
      understanding STR lengths genome-wide across ancestries and may help identify new 
      disease genes and novel mechanisms of pathogenicity in known disease genes.

TI  - Racial/Ethnic Differences in Association Between Medicaid Expansion and Causes 
      and Costs of Readmission After Acute Ischemic Stroke.
PG  - 101-109
LID - 10.1007/s40615-022-01501-5 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine whether the relative 
      frequency of leading causes and total associated costs of readmission after acute 
      ischemic stroke changed with Medicaid expansion, and how these changes differed 
      by racial/ethnic group. METHODS: We used a difference-in-differences approach to 
      compare changes in the relative frequency of leading causes of unplanned 30-day 
      readmission and to examine changes in the costs associated with unplanned 
      readmission between expansion states (AR, MD, NM, and WA) and non-expansion 
      states (FL and GA). To estimate the differential effect of Medicaid expansion by 
      race/ethnicity on the causes and cost of readmission, we added a 
      time*treatment*race interaction. Multinomial logistic regression was performed to 
      analyze the changes in readmission cause. Gamma log-link modeling was used to 
      study changes in readmission costs for expansion compared to non-expansion 
      states. RESULTS: The final multinomial model showed an association between 
      expanded Medicaid and the relative frequency of sepsis readmission for White 
      patients. According to predictive margins, White patients in expansion states had 
      an estimated increase of 3.3 percentage points in the share of readmissions for 
      sepsis but not for White patients in non-expansion states. In contrast, non-White 
      patients in expansion states had a decrease of 1.8 percentage points in the share 
      of readmissions for sepsis. Overall, Medicaid expansion was associated with a net 
      increase of 6.7 percentage points in the share of readmissions for sepsis among 
      non-Hispanic Whites relative to all other groups. In the final gamma model, 
      Medicaid expansion was associated with a decrease in readmission costs overall. 
      According to predictive margins, the net cost reduction in expansion versus 
      non-expansion states was an average of $2509. CONCLUSIONS: Medicaid expansion is 
      associated with an overall decrease in unplanned readmission costs and an 
      increase among readmitted White patients in the likelihood of readmission for 
      sepsis.

TI  - Fast and reliable detection of repeat expansions in spinocerebellar ataxia using 
      exomes.
PG  - 717-721
LID - 10.1136/jmg-2022-108924 [doi]
AB  - Usually, molecular diagnosis of spinocerebellar ataxia is based on a step-by-step 
      approach with targeted sizing of four repeat expansions accounting for most 
      dominant cases, then targeted sequencing of other genes. Nowadays, genome 
      sequencing allows detection of most pathogenic variants in a single step. The 
      ExpansionHunter tool can detect expansions in short-read genome sequencing data. 
      Recent studies have shown that ExpansionHunter can also be used to identify 
      repeat expansions in exome sequencing data. We tested ExpansionHunter on 
      spinocerebellar ataxia exomes in a research context as a second-line analysis, 
      after exclusion of main CAG repeat expansions in half of the probands. First, we 
      confirmed the detection of expansions in seven known expansion carriers and then, 
      after targeted analysis of ATXN1, 2, 3 and 7, CACNA1A, TBP, ATN1, NOP56, AR and 
      HTT in 498 exomes, we found 22 additional pathogenic expansions. Comparison with 
      capillary migration sizing in 247 individuals and confirmation of all expanded 
      alleles detected by ExpansionHunter demonstrated that for these loci, sensitivity 
      and specificity reached 100%. ExpansionHunter detected but underestimated the 
      repeat size for larger expansions, and the normal alleles distribution at each 
      locus should be taken into account to detect expansions. Exome combined with 
      ExpansionHunter is reliable to detect repeat expansions in selected loci as 
      first-line analysis in spinocerebellar ataxia.

AB  - Extended CAG trinucleotide repeats (TNR) in the genes huntingtin (HTT) and 
      androgen receptor (AR) are the cause of two progressive neurodegenerative 
      disorders: Huntington's disease (HD) and Spinal and Bulbar Muscular Atrophy 
      (SBMA), respectively. Anyone who inherits the mutant gene in the complete 
      penetrance range (>39 repeats for HD and 44 for SBMA) will develop the disease. 
      An inverse correlation exists between the length of the CAG repeat and the 
      severity and age of onset of the diseases. Growing evidence suggests that it is 
      the length of uninterrupted CAG repeats in the mRNA rather than the length of 
      poly glutamine (polyQ) in mutant (m)HTT protein that determines disease 
      progression. One variant of mHTT (loss of inhibition; LOI) causes a 25 year 
      earlier onset of HD when compared to a reference sequence, despite both coding 
      for a protein that contains an identical number of glutamines. Short 21-22 nt CAG 
      repeat (sCAGs)-containing RNAs can cause disease through RNA interference (RNAi). 
      RNA hairpins (HPs) forming at the CAG TNRs are stabilized by adjacent CCG (in HD) 
      or CUG repeats (in SBMA) making them better substrates for Dicer, the enzyme that 
      processes CAG HPs into sCAGs. We now show that cells deficient in Dicer or unable 
      to mediate RNAi are resistant to the toxicity of the HTT and AR derived HPs. 
      Expression of a small HP that mimics the HD LOI variant is more stable and more 
      toxic than a reference HP. We report that the LOI HP is processed by Dicer, 
      loaded into the RISC more efficiently, and gives rise to a higher quantity of 
      RISC-bound 22 nt sCAGs. Our data support the notion that RNAi contributes to the 
      cell death seen in HD and SBMA and provide an explanation for the dramatically 
      reduced onset of disease in HD patients that carry the LOI variant.

TI  - Androgen Receptor Gene CAG Repeat Length Varies and Affects Semen Quality in an 
      Ethnic-Specific Fashion in Young Men from Russia.
LID - 10.3390/ijms231810594 [doi]
LID - 10594
AB  - Male infertility is a multi-factorial and multi-genetic disorder, and the 
      prevalence of male infertility in the world is estimated at 5-35%. The search for 
      the causes of male infertility allowed for identifying a number of genetic 
      factors including a single X-linked gene of the androgen receptor (AR), and some 
      of its alleles are assumed to negatively affect male fertility. Our aim was (1) 
      to study the variability of the length of CAG repeats of the AR gene and possible 
      associations in the AR CAG genetic variants with semen quality and reproductive 
      hormone levels in a population-based cohort of men and (2) to estimate 
      distributions of AR CAG repeat alleles and associations with semen parameters in 
      different ethnic subgroups. The cohort of 1324 young male volunteers of different 
      ethnicities (median age 23.0 years) was recruited from the general population of 
      five cities of the Russian Federation, regardless of their fertility status. 
      Semen quality (sperm concentration, motility and morphology), reproductive 
      hormone levels (testosterone, estradiol, LH, FSH and inhibin B) and trinucleotide 
      (CAG) n repeat polymorphism in exon 1 of the AR gene were evaluated. The semen 
      samples were analyzed according to the WHO laboratory manual (WHO, 2010), serum 
      hormones were measured by enzyme immunoassay, and the AR CAG repeat length was 
      analyzed by direct sequencing of leukocyte DNA. The median AR CAG repeat length 
      in men of our multi-ethnic population was 23 (range 6-39). In the entire study 
      population, a significant difference (p </= 0.05) was found in the frequency 
      distribution and the mean values for the CAG repeat length between the groups 
      with normal (23.2 +/- 3.3) and impaired semen quality (23.9 +/- 3.2). Additionally, 
      we demonstrated that the total sperm count, sperm concentration, progressive 
      motility and normal morphology were lower in the category of long CAG repeats 
      (CAG >/= 25) compared with those in the category of short CAG repeats (CAG </= 19); 
      however, hormonal parameters did not differ between the long and short CAG 
      categories, with the exception of estradiol. Significant differences were 
      observed in the AR CAG repeat length between the most common ethnic cohorts of 
      Slavs (Caucasians), Buryats (Asians), and Yakuts (Asians). The Buryats and Yakuts 
      had a higher number of CAG repeats than the Slavs (medians: Slavs-23; Buryats-24; 
      Yakuts-25). The range of alleles differed among ethnicities, with the Slavs 
      having the largest range (7-36 repeats, 24 alleles total), the Yakuts having the 
      smallest range (18-32 repeats, 14 alleles total) and the Buryats having the 
      middle range (11-39 repeats, 20 alleles total). The longer CAG repeats were 
      associated with an impaired semen quality within the Slavic (CAG >/= 25) and Buryat 
      (CAG >/= 28) groups, but this effect was not found in Yakuts. Hormonal parameters 
      did not differ between the three CAG repeat categories in men of all ethnic 
      groups. This is the largest Russian study of the distribution of AR CAG repeats 
      and the search for association between length of AR CAG repeat tract and impaired 
      spermatogenesis in men from the general population. Our results confirmed the 
      association of longer CAG repeats with a risk of impaired semen quality, but this 
      association can be modified by ethnic origin. Identification of the number of AR 
      CAG repeats can be an effective tool to assess the risk of male subfertility and 
      the control of androgen hormone therapy of reproductive diseases.

TI  - Reliable virtual clinical assessment in spino-bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA).
PG  - 161
LID - 10.1136/jnnp-2022-329616 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spino-bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), caused by a CAG repeat 
      expansion in the androgen receptor gene, affects adult men and results in muscle 
      atrophy and weakness in the bulbar and limb muscles and signs of partial androgen 
      insensitivity. During the COVID-19 pandemic, outpatients' visits have been 
      reduced to preserve safety of frail patients, and telehealth was largely 
      employed. METHODS: From April to November 2020, we monitored 12 patients with 
      SBMA with telehealth and administered remotely two clinical scales currently used 
      for SBMA: Adult Myopathy Assessment Tool (AMAT) and SBMA-Functional Rating Scale 
      (SBMA-FRS). We compared results with previous and subsequent in-person visits' 
      scores, and assessed the longitudinal changes in AMAT and SBMA-FRS scores during 
      7 years through the repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: 
      Repeated measures ANOVA of AMAT scores collected during 7 years and including 
      tele-AMAT evaluation showed a steady mean decline of 1-2 points per year. A 
      similar trend of SBMA-FRS scores, with a mean decline per year of about 1 point, 
      was observed. There was no relevant deviation from the model prediction. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that telehealth is a valid tool to monitor patients 
      with SBMA: AMAT and SBMA-FRS scales can be effectively, reliably and easily 
      administered remotely.

TI  - The relationship between common mutations in CFTR, AR genes, Y chromosome 
      microdeletions and karyotyping abnormalities with very severe oligozoospermia in 
      Iranian men.
PG  - 519-529
LID - 10.1007/s13258-022-01300-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Male infertility due to very severe oligozoospermia has been 
      associated with some genetic risk factors. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the 
      distribution of the mutations in the CFTR gene, the CAG-repeat expansion of the 
      AR gene, also Y chromosome microdeletions and karyotyping abnormalities in very 
      severe oligozoospermia patients. METHODS: In the present case-control study, 200 
      patients and 200 fertile males were enrolled. All patients and control group were 
      karyotyped. Microdeletions were evaluated using multiplex PCR. Five common CFTR 
      mutations were genotyped using the ARMS-PCR technique. The CAG-repeat expansion 
      in the AR gene was evaluated for each individual using sequencing. RESULTS: 
      Overall 4% of cases shows a numerical and structural abnormality. 7.5% of 
      patients had a deletion in one of the AZF regions on Yq, and 3.5% had a deletion 
      in two regions. F508del was the most common (4.5%) CFTR gene mutation; G542X, and 
      W1282X were detected with 1.5% and 1% respectively. One patient was found to have 
      AZFa microdeletion and F508del in heterozygote form; one patient had AZFb 
      microdeletion with F508del. F508del was seen as compound heterozygous with G542X 
      in one patient and with W1282X in the other patient. The difference in the mean 
      of the CAG-repeats in the AR gene in patients and control groups was 
      statistically significant (P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Our study shows the genetic 
      mutations in men with severe oligozoospermia and given the possibility of 
      transmission of these disorders to the next generation by fertilization, 
      counseling and genetic testing are suggested for these couples before considering 
      ICSI.

TI  - Proposal of a Management Algorithm to Predict the Need for Expansion Duraplasty 
      in American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale Grades A-C Traumatic 
      Cervical Spinal Cord Injury Patients.
PG  - 1716-1726

AB  - Expansion duraplasty to reopen effaced subarachnoid space and improve spinal cord 
      perfusion, autoregulation, and spinal pressure reactivity index (sPRX) has been 
      advocated in patients with traumatic cervical spinal cord injury (tCSCI). We 
      designed this study to identify candidates for expansion duraplasty, based on the 
      absence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) interface around the spinal cord on magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI), in the setting of otherwise adequate bony decompression. 
      Over a 61-month period, 104 consecutive American Spinal Injury Association 
      Impairment Scale (AIS) grades A-C patients with tCSCI had post-operative MRI to 
      assess the adequacy of surgical decompression. Their mean age was 53.4 years, and 
      89% were male. Sixty-one patients had falls, 31 motor vehicle collisions, 11 
      sport injuries, and one an assault. The AIS grade was A in 56, B in 18, and C in 
      30 patients. Fifty-four patients had fracture dislocations; there was no evidence 
      of skeletal injury in 50 patients. Mean intramedullary lesion length (IMLL) was 
      46.9 (standard deviation = 19.4) mm. Median time from injury to decompression was 
      17 h (interquartile range 15.2 h). After surgery, 94 patients had adequate 
      decompression as judged by the presence of CSF anterior and posterior to the 
      spinal cord, whereas 10 patients had effacement of the subarachnoid space at the 
      injury epicenter. In two patients whose decompression was not definitive and 
      post-operative MRI indicated inadequate decompression, expansion duraplasty was 
      performed. Candidates for expansion duraplasty (i.e., those with inadequate 
      decompression) were significantly younger (p < 0.0001), were AIS grade A 
      (p < 0.0016), had either sport injuries (six patients) or motor vehicle 
      collisions (three patients) (p < 0.0001), had fracture dislocation (p = 0.00016), 
      and had longer IMLL (p = 0.0097). In regression models, patients with sport 
      injuries and inadequate decompression were suitable candidates for expansion 
      duraplasty (p = 0.03). Further, 9.6% of patients failed bony decompression alone 
      and either did (2) or would have (8) benefited from expansion duraplasty.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare the changes in the nasal airway volume and 
      nasal airflow using acoustic rhinometry (AR), rhinomanometry (RMN), and dental 
      volumetric tomography (DVT) after surgically assisted rapid maxillary expansion 
      (SARME). STUDY DESIGN: Our study consists of 13 adults, 3 male and 10 female 
      patients, aged between 15 and 26, with completed skeletal development. In our 
      study, DVT imaging was obtained twice, preoperation and 3 months after expansion. 
      AR and RMN measurements were recorded, and Visual Analog Score (VAS) and Nasal 
      Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) Scale surveys were scored at preoperation 
      and 3 months after expansion. Nasopharyngeal-oropharyngeal airway volume and 
      areas were calculated using the Romexis 3.8.3.R (Planmeca, Helsinki, Finland) and 
      Nemotec V2019 (Madrid, Spain) software programs. IBM SPSS Statistics 22 (SPSS 
      IBM, Armonk, New York) was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Comparing the 
      preoperation and postexpansion measurements by both software programs revealed a 
      statistically significant increase in the nasopharyngeal airway volume. No 
      statistically significant change was observed in the oropharyngeal airway volume. 
      Furthermore, we found a statistically significant increase in VAS but a 
      significant decrease in NOSE. CONCLUSION: According to our findings, nasal airway 
      volume increased after SARME, and although there was no significant change in 
      nasal resistance, patients' quality of life increased significantly.

LID - 10.1093/brain/awac269 [doi]
AB  - Spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), the first identified CAG-repeat expansion 
      disorder, is an X-linked neuromuscular disorder involving CAG-repeat-expansion 
      mutations in the androgen receptor (AR) gene. We utilized CRISPR-Cas9 gene 
      editing to engineer novel isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) 
      models, consisting of isogenic AR knockout, control and disease lines expressing 
      mutant AR with distinct repeat lengths, as well as control and disease lines 
      expressing FLAG-tagged wild-type and mutant AR, respectively. Adapting a 
      small-molecule cocktail-directed approach, we differentiate the isogenic hiPSC 
      models into motor neuron-like cells with a highly enriched population to uncover 
      cell-type-specific mechanisms underlying SBMA and to distinguish gain- from 
      loss-of-function properties of mutant AR in disease motor neurons. We demonstrate 
      that ligand-free mutant AR causes drastic mitochondrial dysfunction in neurites 
      of differentiated disease motor neurons due to gain-of-function mechanisms and 
      such cytotoxicity can be amplified upon ligand (androgens) treatment. We further 
      show that aberrant interaction between ligand-free, mitochondria-localized mutant 
      AR and F-ATP synthase is associated with compromised mitochondrial respiration 
      and multiple other mitochondrial impairments. These findings counter the 
      established notion that androgens are requisite for mutant AR-induced 
      cytotoxicity in SBMA, reveal a compelling mechanistic link between ligand-free 
      mutant AR, F-ATP synthase and mitochondrial dysfunction, and provide innovative 
      insights into motor neuron-specific therapeutic interventions for SBMA.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The expansion of a hexanucleotide GGGGCC repeat (G4C2) in the 
      C9orf72 locus is the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
      (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In addition, C9orf72 expansion has also 
      been detected in patients with a clinical manifestation of Parkinson's Disease 
      (PD), Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Huntington's Disease (HD), and ataxic disorders. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 1,387 patients with clinically suspected ALS, HD 
      or spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) were enrolled, and the prevalence of 
      C9orf72 expansions was estimated. RESULTS: The hexanucleotide expansion accounted 
      for 3.7% of the ALS patients, 0.2% of the HD suspected patients with excluded HTT 
      mutation, and 1.3% of the suspected SBMA patients with excluded mutation in AR 
      gene. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report revealing the presence of C9orf72 
      expansion in patients with a suspected SBMA diagnosis. Consequently, we advise 
      testing for C9orf72 expansion in patients presenting with the SBMA phenotype and 
      a genetically unsolved diagnosis.

TI  - The Clinical and Polynucleotide Repeat Expansion Analysis of ATXN2, NOP56, AR and

AB  - BACKGROUND: Repeat expansions, including those in C9orf72 and ATXN2, have been 
      implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, there have been few 
      studies on the association of AR and NOP56 repeat expansion with ALS, especially 
      in China. Accordingly, we aimed to evaluate the frequency of C9orf72 and ATXN2 
      repeat mutations and investigate whether NOP56 and AR repeat expansion are risk 
      factors for ALS. METHODS: In this study, 736 ALS patients and several hundred 
      healthy controls were recruited. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 
      repeat-primed PCR (RP-PCR) were performed to determine the repeat lengths in 
      C9orf72, ATXN2, AR, and NOP56. RESULTS: GGGGCC repeats in C9orf72 were observed 
      in six ALS patients (0.8%, 6/736) but not in any of the controls (0/365). The 
      patients with pathogenic GGGGCC repeats showed shorter median survival times than 
      those with a normal genotype (p = 0.006). Regarding ATXN2 CAG repeats, we 
      identified that intermediate repeat lengths (29-34 copies) were associated with 
      ALS (p = 0.033), and there was no difference in clinical characteristics between 
      the groups with and without intermediate repeats (p > 0.05). Meanwhile, we 
      observed that there was no association between the repeat size in AR and NOP56 
      and ALS (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that pathogenetic 
      repeats in C9orf72 are rare in China, while intermediate CAG repeats in ATXN2 are

TI  - Evaluation of CAG repeat length in the androgen receptor gene and polycystic 
      ovary syndrome risk in Iranian women: A case-control study.
PG  - 195-202
LID - 10.18502/ijrm.v20i3.10711 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous disorder, which 
      affects about 15-20% of women of reproductive age. The most important 
      etiopathogenesis factor in its incidence is hyperandrogenism; over 70 candidate 
      genes are known to be associated with this syndrome, such as the androgen 
      receptor (AR) gene which encodes a steroid receptor and is located on the Xq11-12 
      chromosome. The N-terminus of exon 1 of AR contains a polymorphic trinucleotide 
      repeat (CAG)(n) region that encodes glutamine tract. There are some studies 
      showing that shorter AR CAG repeats are significantly related to enhanced AR 
      sensitivity. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the frequency of the polymorphic 
      expansion of the trinucleotide CAG repeats of AR in PCOS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      160 Iranian women aged 17-40 yr participated in this case-control study: 80 women 
      as PCOS patients and 80 women as healthy controls according to the Rotterdam 
      criteria. Other similar phenotype factors such as hyperandrogenism were not 
      considered as PCOS. The frequency of polymorphic expansion of CAG trinucleotide 
      repeats in PCOS patients was compared with the frequency in non-PCOS controls in 
      using two primer sets for nested polymerase chain reaction. The polymerase chain 
      reaction products were visualized on polyacrylamide gel and then were confirmed 
      by a sequencing process. RESULTS: The results did not show a significant 
      correlation between the frequency of CAG repeats in AR and PCOS incidence. 
      CONCLUSION: In contrast to some previous reports, the present data showed that 
      the CAG length in PCOS cases did not significantly differ from that of controls. 
      So, the AR (CAG)(n) does not appear to be a major factor for PCOS in Iranian 
      women.

TI  - Ultrasonographic evaluation reveals thinning of cervical nerve roots and 
      peripheral nerves in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.
PG  - 4267-4274

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ultrasonography (US) is a noninvasive and patient-friendly tool for 
      the evaluation of peripheral nerves. In motor neuron diseases, amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis (ALS) has been reported to show the atrophy of peripheral 
      nerves on US. However, the US findings are still unclear in spinal and bulbar 
      muscular atrophy (SBMA), an adult-onset lower motor neuron disease caused by an 
      abnormal CAG repeat expansion in the androgen receptor gene. METHODS: We 
      prospectively recruited and evaluated 11 patients with genetically confirmed SBMA 
      and 9 patients with ALS diagnosed according to the revised El Escorial ALS 
      criteria or the Awaji electrodiagnostic criteria. The C5-C7 cervical nerve roots 
      and the median and ulnar nerves were evaluated ultrasonographically. RESULTS: The 
      cross-sectional areas (CSAs) of the C6 and C7 nerve roots, the median nerve in 
      the upper arm and forearm, and the ulnar nerve in the upper arm were smaller in 
      patients with SBMA than those in patients with ALS (p < 0.05), whereas the CSAs 
      of the C5 nerve root and the ulnar nerve in the forearm were not smaller. 
      CONCLUSIONS: US showed that the peripheral nerves in patients with SBMA were 
      thinner than those in patients with ALS despite similar degrees of weakness and 
      motor neuron loss. Possible causes include additional sensory nerve involvement 
      and longer disease duration in patients with SBMA than those in patients with 
      ALS.

TI  - Novel protein markers of androgen activity in humans: proteomic study of plasma 
      from young chemically castrated men.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.74638 [doi]
LID - e74638
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reliable biomarkers of androgen activity in humans are lacking. The 
      aim of this study was, therefore, to identify new protein markers of biological 
      androgen activity and test their predictive value in relation to low vs normal 
      testosterone values and some androgen deficiency linked pathologies. METHODS: 
      Blood samples from 30 healthy GnRH antagonist treated males were collected at 
      three time points: (1) before GnRH antagonist administration; (2) 3 weeks later, 
      just before testosterone undecanoate injection, and (3) after additional 2 weeks. 
      Subsequently, they were analyzed by mass spectrometry to identify potential 
      protein biomarkers of testosterone activity. Levels of proteins most 
      significantly associated with testosterone fluctuations were further tested in a 
      cohort of 75 hypo- and eugonadal males suffering from infertility. Associations 
      between levels of those markers and cardiometabolic parameters, bone mineral 
      density as well as androgen receptor (AR) CAG repeat lengths, were explored. 
      RESULTS: Using receiver operating characteristic analysis, 
      4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (4HPPD), insulin-like growth factor-binding 
      protein 6 (IGFBP6), and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (ALDOB), as well as a 
      Multi Marker Algorithm, based on levels of 4HPPD and IGFBP6, were shown to be 
      best predictors of low (<8 nmol/l) vs normal (>12 nmol/l) testosterone. They were 
      also more strongly associated with metabolic syndrome and diabetes than 
      testosterone levels. Levels of ALDOB and 4HPPD also showed association with AR 
      CAG repeat lengths. CONCLUSIONS: We identified potential new protein biomarkers 
      of testosterone action. Further investigations to elucidate their clinical 
      potential are warranted. FUNDING: The work was supported by ReproUnion2.0 (grant 
      no. 20201846), which is funded by the Interreg V EU program.

OAB - Although it is best known for its role in developing male sex organs and 
      maintaining sexual function, the hormone testosterone is important for many parts 
      of the human body. A deficiency can cause an increased risk of serious conditions 
      such as diabetes, cancer and osteoporosis. Testosterone deficiency can develop 
      due to disease or age-related changes, and men affected by this can be given 
      supplements of this hormone to restore normal levels. The most common way to test 
      for testosterone deficiency is by measuring the concentration of the hormone in 
      the blood. However, this does not accurately reflect the activity of the hormone 
      in the body. This may lead to men who need more testosterone not receiving 
      enough, and to others being unnecessarily treated. Several factors may lead to 
      discrepancy between testosterone concentration in blood and its physiological 
      activity. One of the most common is obesity. Additionally, certain genetic 
      factors, which cannot be controlled for yet, regulate sensitivity to this 
      hormone: some people do well at low levels, while others need high concentrations 
      to be healthy. Therefore, to improve the diagnosis of testosterone deficiency it 
      is necessary to identify biological markers whose levels act as a proxy for 
      testosterone activity. Giwercman, Sahlin et al. studied the levels of a large 
      number of proteins in the blood of 30 young men before and after blocking 
      testosterone production. The analysis found three proteins whose concentrations 
      changed significantly after testosterone deprivation. Giwercman, Sahlin et al. 
      then validated these markers for testosterone deficiency by checking the levels 
      of the three proteins in a separate group of 75 men with fertility problems. The 
      results also showed that the three protein markers were better at predicting 
      diabetes and metabolic syndrome than testosterone levels alone. These newly 
      discovered markers could be used to create a test for measuring testosterone 
      activity. This could help to identify deficiencies and finetune the amount of 
      supplementary hormone given to men as treatment. However, further research is 
      needed to understand the clinical value of such a test in men, as well as women 
      and children.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this 3-arm parallel trial was to compare the effects of 
      tooth tissue-borne (TTB), tooth-borne (TB) and bone-borne (BB) rapid maxillary 
      expansion (RME) appliances on nasal airway with acoustic rhinometry (AR). SETTING 
      AND SAMPLE POPULATION: Forty-six 12- to 14-year-old patients with narrow maxilla 
      were randomly allocated into 3 study groups accordingly the type of expander: 
      TTB, TB and BB. The participants were recruited from the Department of 
      Orthodontics, Izmir Katip Celebi University. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients 
      had RME with an initial activation of two-quarter turns a day (0.5 mm) for an 
      average of 8 days followed by 1 quarter turns per day for an average of 10 days. 
      Disguised group allocation using opaque sealed envelopes was made with a 
      computer-generated randomization program. The primary outcome was changes on the 
      minimal nasal cross-sectional area (MCA). Secondary outcome included the 
      assessment of nasal cavity volume. AR measurements were obtained at baseline 
      (T0), immediately after the expansion (T1), and at 3 months-follow-up (T2). 
      One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Bonferroni test were used for 
      inter-group comparison and two-way ANOVA was used for intra-group evaluation. 
      RESULTS: There were significant increases in MCA 1, 2 and nasal Vol in all groups 
      after the treatment (95% [CI], P < 0.05) whereas in inter-group comparisons; MCA 
      1, 2 and nasal Vol, the changes were found to be similar (95% [CI], P > 0.05). 
      HARMS: No serious harm was observed except for mild gingivitis due to plaque 
      accumulation. CONCLUSIONS: RME treatment increased minimal nasal cross-sectional 
      areas and nasal volume irrespective of appliance design. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This 
      trial was registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier NCT04529057). PROTOCOL: 
      The protocol was not published. FUNDING: This trial was financed by Izmir Katip 
      Celebi University, Scientific Research Projects Unit [grant number 
      2016-TDR-SABE-0024].

TI  - Whole genome sequencing for the diagnosis of neurological repeat expansion 
      disorders in the UK: a retrospective diagnostic accuracy and prospective clinical 
      validation study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Repeat expansion disorders affect about 1 in 3000 individuals and are 
      clinically heterogeneous diseases caused by expansions of short tandem DNA 
      repeats. Genetic testing is often locus-specific, resulting in underdiagnosis of 
      people who have atypical clinical presentations, especially in paediatric 
      patients without a previous positive family history. Whole genome sequencing is 
      increasingly used as a first-line test for other rare genetic disorders, and we 
      aimed to assess its performance in the diagnosis of patients with neurological 
      repeat expansion disorders. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed the diagnostic 
      accuracy of whole genome sequencing to detect the most common repeat expansion 
      loci associated with neurological outcomes (AR, ATN1, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, 
      C9orf72, CACNA1A, DMPK, FMR1, FXN, HTT, and TBP) using samples obtained within 
      the National Health Service in England from patients who were suspected of having 
      neurological disorders; previous PCR test results were used as the reference 
      standard. The clinical accuracy of whole genome sequencing to detect repeat 
      expansions was prospectively examined in previously genetically tested and 
      undiagnosed patients recruited in 2013-17 to the 100 000 Genomes Project in the 
      UK, who were suspected of having a genetic neurological disorder (familial or 
      early-onset forms of ataxia, neuropathy, spastic paraplegia, dementia, motor 
      neuron disease, parkinsonian movement disorders, intellectual disability, or 
      neuromuscular disorders). If a repeat expansion call was made using whole genome 
      sequencing, PCR was used to confirm the result. FINDINGS: The diagnostic accuracy 
      of whole genome sequencing to detect repeat expansions was evaluated against 793 
      PCR tests previously performed within the NHS from 404 patients. Whole genome 
      sequencing correctly classified 215 of 221 expanded alleles and 1316 of 1321 
      non-expanded alleles, showing 97.3% sensitivity (95% CI 94.2-99.0) and 99.6% 
      specificity (99.1-99.9) across the 13 disease-associated loci when compared with 
      PCR test results. In samples from 11 631 patients in the 100 000 Genomes Project, 
      whole genome sequencing identified 81 repeat expansions, which were also tested 
      by PCR: 68 were confirmed as repeat expansions in the full pathogenic range, 11 
      were non-pathogenic intermediate expansions or premutations, and two were 
      non-expanded repeats (16% false discovery rate). INTERPRETATION: In our study, 
      whole genome sequencing for the detection of repeat expansions showed high 
      sensitivity and specificity, and it led to identification of neurological repeat 
      expansion disorders in previously undiagnosed patients. These findings support 
      implementation of whole genome sequencing in clinical laboratories for diagnosis 
      of patients who have a neurological presentation consistent with a repeat 
      expansion disorder. FUNDING: Medical Research Council, Department of Health and

AB  - Mutations in the DNAJB6 gene cause limb girdle muscular dystrophy D1 (LGMD D1) 
      and distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles. With the discovery of new mutations, 
      the phenotypic spectrum of DNAJB6-related myopathy has been extended, making the 
      diagnosis more complicated. In this study, we describe a female carrier of spinal 
      and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) diagnosed with DNAJB6-related distal myopathy. 
      The c.292_294delGAT (p. Asp98del) mutation in the DNAJB6 gene and a 49 CAG repeat 
      expansion in the androgen receptor (AR) gene were identified. According to the 
      clinical manifestations of distal-dominant lower limb involvement, a myogenic 
      pattern in the electrophysiological study, and rimmed vacuoles on muscle 
      pathology, the patient was ultimately diagnosed with DNAJB6-related distal 
      myopathy. A functional study in a zebrafish model indicated that the 
      c.292_294delGAT (p. Asp98del) mutation contributed to muscle structure defects. 
      This study offers useful insights for the differential diagnosis of a condition 
      in which patients carry pathogenic variants in different genes.

AB  - We present a retrospective 21-year follow-up of two sisters with X-linked 
      biallelic CAG expansions in the androgen receptor (AR) gene causing Kennedy 
      disease. Two sisters inherited CAG expansions from their mother who was a carrier 
      and their father who had Kennedy disease. Genetic testing revealed alleles 
      comprising 43/45, and 43/43 CAG repeats in the younger and older sister, 
      respectively. They were referred to a neurologist for further evaluation. Both 
      reported similar symptoms with chronic backache, pain and cramps in upper- and 
      lower extremities, and fasciculations in their faces and extremities. 
      Neurological examination demonstrated postural hand tremor in both and EMG 
      revealed chronic neurogenic changes. Reevaluation of the patients at ages 74 and 
      83 showed slight progression of clinical manifestations. As opposed to male 
      patients, these two females showed minimal disease progression and have 
      maintained normal level of function into old age.

AB  - To examine whether rates of 30-day readmission after acute ischemic stroke 
      changed differentially between Medicaid expansion and non-expansion states, and 
      whether race/ethnicity moderated this change, we conducted a 
      difference-in-differences analysis using 6 state inpatient databases (AR, FL, GA, 
      MD, NM, and WA) from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. Analysis 
      included all patients aged 19-64 hospitalized in 2012-2015 with a principal 
      diagnosis of ischemic stroke and a primary payer of Medicaid, self-pay, or no 
      charge, who resided in the state where admitted and were discharged alive 
      (N=28 330). No association was detected between Medicaid expansion and 
      readmission overall, but there was evidence of moderation by race/ethnicity. The 
      predicted probability of all-cause readmission among non-Hispanic White patients 
      rose an estimated 2.6 percentage points (or 39%) in expansion states but not in 
      non-expansion states, whereas it increased by 1.5 percentage points (or 23%) for 
      non-White and Hispanic patients in non-expansion states. Therefore, Medicaid 
      expansion was associated with a rise in readmission probability that was 4.0 
      percentage points higher for non-Hispanic Whites compared to other racial/ethnic 
      groups, after adjustment for covariates. Similar trends were observed when 
      unplanned and potentially preventable readmissions were isolated. Among 
      low-income stroke survivors, we found evidence that 2 years of Medicaid expansion 
      promoted rehospitalization, but only for White patients. Future studies should 
      verify these findings over a longer follow-up period.

AB  - There is a distinct increase in the prevalence of depression with the onset of 
      puberty. The role of peripubertal testosterone levels in boys in this context is 
      insufficiently understood and may be modulated by a functional polymorphism of 
      the androgen receptor gene (AR), a variable number of CAG repeats. Moreover, 
      there is preliminary evidence that the relationship between testosterone, CAG 
      repeat length, and the severity of depressive symptoms may differ between 
      subclinical and overt depression, but this has neither been studied in a clinical 
      sample of adolescents with depression nor compared between subclinical and overt 
      depression in an adequately powered study. To investigate the relationship 
      between free testosterone, CAG repeat length of the AR, depression status 
      (subclinical vs. overt), and the severity of depressive symptoms, 118 boys 
      treated as in- or daycare patients at a single psychiatric hospital were studied. 
      Of these, 73 boys had at least mild depressive symptoms according to the Beck 
      Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II > 13). Higher-order moderation analysis in the 
      multiple regression framework revealed a constant relationship between free 
      testosterone and depression severity irrespective of the number of CAG repeats in 
      adolescents with a BDI-II score </= 13. In adolescents with a BDI-II score > 13, 
      however, there was a significant negative relationship between free testosterone 
      and BDI-II score in patients with <19 CAG repeats and a significant positive 
      relationship regarding free testosterone and BDI-II score in those with more than 
      28 CAG repeats, even when considering important covariates. These results suggest 
      that the effects of testosterone on mood in male adolescents with depression 
      depend on the genetic make-up of the AR as well as on depression status. This 
      complex relationship should be considered by future studies addressing mental 
      health issues against an endocrine background and may, moreover, contribute to 
      tailored treatment concepts in psychiatric medicine, especially in adults.

TI  - CAG repeat polymorphism in androgen receptor and infertility: A case-control 
      study.
PG  - 845-851
LID - 10.18502/ijrm.v19i9.9717 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Androgens play a role in the development of male phenotype and 
      spermatogenesis during puberty, the function of which is regulated by the 
      androgen receptor (AR) gene. There is a polymorphism site in exon 1 of the gene 
      encoding this receptor that can have different frequencies of CAG trinucleotide 
      repeats and leads to the formation of polyglutamine chains of different lengths 
      in the N-terminal domain of the AR protein and reduced sperm production by 
      affecting spermatogenesis. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the cause of a group 
      of unexplained infertilities could be the increased frequency of CAG repeats in 
      the AR gene of patients with oligozoospermia and azoospermia. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: In this case-control study, 84 men including 42 with unexplained 
      infertility As a case group and 42 fertile men as a control group were selected. 
      The frequency of CAG repeats was determined by the polymerase chain reaction 
      method and then the difference in the frequency of these repeats was determined 
      based on the difference in band size on the agarose gel. RESULTS: The mean CAG 
      repeat length in the azoospermia and oligozoospermia group was 17.5 +/- 0.63 and in 
      the fertile group it was 16.11 +/- 0.75 (p = 0.46). In addition, most men (88.1% in 
      the case group and 71.41% in the control group) had 13-23 repeats. CONCLUSION: No 
      significant correlation was found between CAG repeat length and the risk of male 
      factor infertility in an ethnically defined population of Iranian men. The role 
      of regulatory factors and epigenetic changes should be taken into account too.

TI  - Monitoring of Donor-Derived Cell-Free DNA by Short Tandem Repeats: Concentration 
      of Total Cell-Free DNA and Fragment Size for Acute Rejection Risk Assessment in 
      Liver Transplantation.
PG  - 257-268
LID - 10.1002/lt.26272 [doi]
AB  - Monitoring of graft function is essential during the first months after liver 
      transplantation (LT), but current liver function tests (LFTs) lack the 
      specificity and sensitivity to ensure an efficient diagnosis of acute rejection 
      (AR). Recently, donor-derived cell-free DNA (ddcfDNA) has emerged as a 
      noninvasive biomarker to assess graft integrity. This study evaluated the 
      feasibility of measuring the ddcfDNA through short tandem repeat (STR) analysis 
      by quantitative fluorescent-polymerase chain reaction (QF-PCR) and to assess the 
      role of the concentration and fragment size of total cfDNA as AR biomarkers. The 
      total concentration and fragment size of cfDNA and the ddcfDNA percentage were 
      monitored in plasma of 20 patients without rejection and 7 patients with 
      T-cell-mediated AR during the first 3 months after LT. The median ddcfDNA 
      percentage was 3-fold higher before AR diagnosis (34.8%; P < 0.001) and 
      moderately higher at AR confirmatory diagnosis (23.8%; P = 0.049) compared with 
      that of nonrejector patients (10.6%), showing a better performance (area under 
      the curve = 84.6%) than conventional LFTs to predict the risk of rejection within 
      the first 2 weeks following LT. The fraction of 100-250-bp cfDNA fragments was 
      higher at AR diagnosis compared with that of nonrejector patients (68.0% versus 
      57.9%, P = 0.02). STR amplification by QF-PCR may be an alternative strategy for 
      rapid ddcfDNA quantification, which is easily implementable in clinical 
      laboratories. The results of this pilot study indicate that ddcfDNA increases 
      very early, even 1-2 weeks before the diagnosis of AR, and so it could be useful 
      as a prognostic biomarker in improving patient risk stratification.

TI  - Cognitive changes and brain connectomes, endocrine status, and risk genotypes in 
      testicular cancer patients-A prospective controlled study.
PG  - 6249-6260
LID - 10.1002/cam4.4165 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous research has indicated cognitive decline (CD) among 
      testicular cancer patients (TCPs), even in the absence of chemotherapy, but 
      little is known about the underlying pathophysiology. The present study assessed 
      changes in cognitive functions and structural brain connectomes in TCPs and 
      explored the associations between cognitive changes and endocrine status and 
      hypothesized risk genotypes. METHODS: Thirty-eight newly orchiectomized TCPs and 
      21 healthy controls (HCs) comparable to TCPs in terms of age and years of 
      education underwent neuropsychological testing, structural MRI, and a biological 
      assessment at baseline and 6 months later. Cognitive change was assessed with a 
      neuropsychological test battery and determined using a standardized 
      regression-based approach, with substantial change defined as z-scores </=-1.64 or 
      >/=1.64. MRI scans and graph theory were used to evaluate changes in structural 
      brain connectomes. The associations of cognitive changes with testosterone 
      levels, androgen receptor gene (AR) CAG repeat length, and genotypes (APOE, COMT, 
      and BDNF) were explored. RESULTS: Compared with HCs, TCPs showed higher rates of 
      substantial decline on processing speed and visuospatial ability and higher rates 
      of substantial improvement on verbal recall and visuospatial learning (p < 0.05; 
      OR = 8.15-15.84). Brain network analysis indicated bilateral thalamic changes in 
      node degree in HCs, but not in TCPs (p < 0.01). In TCPs, higher baseline 
      testosterone levels predicted decline in verbal memory (p < 0.05). No effects 
      were found for AR CAG repeat length, APOE, COMT, or BDNF. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      present study confirms previous findings of domain-specific CD in TCPs following 
      orchiectomy, but also points to domain-specific improvements. The results do not 
      indicate changes in brain connectomes or endocrine status to be the main drivers 
      of CD. Further studies evaluating the mechanisms underlying CD in TCPs, including 
      the possible role of the dynamics of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, are 
      warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Screening for short tandem repeat (STR) expansions in next-generation 
      sequencing data can enable diagnosis, optimal clinical management/treatment, and 
      accurate genetic counseling of patients with repeat expansion disorders. We aimed 
      to develop an efficient computational workflow for reliable detection of STR 
      expansions in next-generation sequencing data and demonstrate its clinical 
      utility. METHODS: We characterized the performance of eight STR analysis methods 
      (lobSTR, HipSTR, RepeatSeq, ExpansionHunter, TREDPARSE, GangSTR, STRetch, and 
      exSTRa) on next-generation sequencing datasets of samples with known 
      disease-causing full-mutation STR expansions and genomes simulated to harbor 
      repeat expansions at selected loci and optimized their sensitivity. We then used 
      a machine learning decision tree classifier to identify an optimal combination of 
      methods for full-mutation detection. In Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA)-aligned 
      genomes, the ensemble approach of using ExpansionHunter, STRetch, and exSTRa 
      performed the best (precision = 82%, recall = 100%, F1-score = 90%). We applied 
      this pipeline to screen 301 families of children with suspected genetic 
      disorders. RESULTS: We identified 10 individuals with full-mutations in the AR, 
      ATXN1, ATXN8, DMPK, FXN, or HTT disease STR locus in the analyzed families. 
      Additional candidates identified in our analysis include two probands with 
      borderline ATXN2 expansions between the established repeat size range for 
      reduced-penetrance and full-penetrance full-mutation and seven individuals with 
      FMR1 CGG repeats in the intermediate/premutation repeat size range. In 67 
      probands with a prior negative clinical PCR test for the FMR1, FXN, or DMPK 
      disease STR locus, or the spinocerebellar ataxia disease STR panel, our pipeline 
      did not falsely identify aberrant expansion. We performed clinical PCR tests on 
      seven (out of 10) full-mutation samples identified by our pipeline and confirmed 
      the expansion status in all, showing absolute concordance between our 
      bioinformatics and molecular findings. CONCLUSIONS: We have successfully 
      demonstrated the application of a well-optimized bioinformatics pipeline that 
      promotes the utility of genome-wide sequencing as a first-tier screening test to 
      detect expansions of known disease STRs. Interrogating clinical next-generation 
      sequencing data for pathogenic STR expansions using our ensemble pipeline can 
      improve diagnostic yield and enhance clinical outcomes for patients with repeat 
      expansion disorders.

TI  - CAG repeats and one polymorphism in androgen receptor gene are associated with 
      renal calcium stone disease.
PG  - 391-396
LID - 10.1177/03915603211017885 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Evidence suggests that androgens can be involved in the pathogenesis of 
      renal stones. This study aimed at investigating coding region polymorphisms and 
      CAG repeats in androgen receptor (AR) and their association with active renal 
      calcium stone disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male patients with calcium kidney 
      stones (N = 106) with at least two episodes of stone recurrence or size increase 
      during the past 5 years (ASF) were enrolled from December 2008 to April 2009. 
      Control individuals were recruited after matching for age and gender from healthy 
      individuals without current stone or history of stone disease. Genetic sequencing 
      and single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) were used to determine AR 
      polymorphisms in the patients and controls. RESULTS: Two polymorphisms were 
      identified in the AR gene: Silent G to A polymorphism in the first exon of the AR 
      gene and C to G polymorphism in intron 4. CAG repeats ranged from 12 to 37. The 
      C/G polymorphism in intron 4 and CAG repeats were associated with the status of 
      active renal calcium stone disease (all p < 0.05). The CC variant of C/G 
      polymorphism was not observed in patients with stone disease. CAG repeats less 
      than 20 and more than 28 were mostly observed in ASF patients (p < 0.05). 
      CONCLUSIONS: CAG repeats and intron 4 C/G polymorphism in the AR gene have an 
      association with renal calcium stone disease.

TI  - Screening of tick-borne pathogens in argasid ticks in Zambia: Expansion of the 
      geographic distribution of Rickettsia lusitaniae and Rickettsia hoogstraalii and 
      detection of putative novel Anaplasma species.

AB  - Ticks (Ixodidae and Argasidae) are important arthropod vectors of various 
      pathogens that cause human and animal infectious diseases. Many previously 
      published studies on tick-borne pathogens focused on those transmitted by ixodid 
      ticks. Although there are increasing reports of viral pathogens associated with 
      argasid ticks, information on bacterial pathogens they transmit is scarce. The 
      aim of this molecular study was to detect and characterize Rickettsia and 
      Anaplasmataceae in three different argasid tick species, Ornithodoros faini, 
      Ornithodoros moubata, and Argas walkerae collected in Zambia. Rickettsia 
      hoogstraalii and Rickettsia lusitaniae were detected in 77 % (77/100) of Ar. 
      walkerae and 10 % (5/50) of O. faini, respectively. All O. moubata pool samples 
      (n = 124) were negative for rickettsial infections. Anaplasmataceae were detected 
      in 63 % (63/100) of Ar. walkerae and in 82.2 % (102/124) of O. moubata pools, but 
      not in O. faini. Phylogenetic analysis based on the concatenated sequences of 16S 
      rRNA and groEL genes revealed that Anaplasma spp. detected in the present study 
      were distinct from previously validated Anaplasma species, indicating that the 
      current knowledge on the diversity and vector range of Anaplasma spp. is 
      incomplete. Our findings highlight new geographical records of R. lusitaniae and 
      R. hoogstraalii and confirm that the wide geographic distribution of these 
      species includes the African continent. The data presented here increase our 
      knowledge on argasid tick-borne bacteria and contribute toward understanding 
      their epidemiology.

TI  - Selective suppression of polyglutamine-expanded protein by lipid 
      nanoparticle-delivered siRNA targeting CAG expansions in the mouse CNS.
PG  - 1-10

AB  - Polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases are inherited neurodegenerative disorders caused 
      by expansion of cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG)-trinucleotide repeats in causative 
      genes. These diseases include spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), 
      Huntington's disease, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, and spinocerebellar 
      ataxias. Targeting expanded CAG repeats is a common therapeutic approach to polyQ 
      diseases, but concomitant silencing of genes with normal CAG repeats may lead to 
      toxicity. Previous studies have shown that CAG repeat-targeting small interfering 
      RNA duplexes (CAG-siRNAs) have the potential to selectively suppress mutant 
      proteins in in vitro cell models of polyQ diseases. However, in vivo application 
      of these siRNAs has not yet been investigated. In this study, we demonstrate that 
      an unlocked nucleic acid (UNA)-modified CAG-siRNA shows high selectivity for 
      polyQ-expanded androgen receptor (AR) inhibition in in vitro cell models and that 
      lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-mediated delivery of the CAG-siRNA selectively 
      suppresses mutant AR in the central nervous system of an SBMA mouse model. In 
      addition, a subcutaneous injection of the LNP-delivered CAG-siRNA efficiently 
      suppresses mutant AR in the skeletal muscle of the SBMA mouse model. These 
      results support the therapeutic potential of LNP-delivered UNA-modified 
      CAG-siRNAs for selective suppression of mutant proteins in SBMA and other polyQ 
      diseases.

AB  - Age-related decrease in testosterone levels is a potential risk factor for 
      cognitive decline in older men. However, observational studies and clinical 
      trials have reported inconsistent results on the effects of testosterone on 
      individual cognitive domains. Null findings may be attributed to factors that 
      studies have yet to consider. In particular, individual variations in 
      polyglutamine (CAG) length in the androgen receptor (AR) gene could alter 
      androgenic activity in brain regions associated with cognitive processes 
      including memory and executive functions. However, the role of AR CAG repeat 
      length as a moderator of the relationship between testosterone levels and 
      cognition has not been investigated. Therefore, we aimed to examine the 
      relationship between baseline calculated free testosterone (cFT) levels, change 
      in cFT levels over 18 months and CAG repeat length on cognitive performance in 
      memory, executive function, language, attention and processing speed domains. 
      These relationships were examined in 304 cognitively normal older male 
      participants of the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) Study of 
      Ageing. In the attention and processing speed domain, a short CAG repeat length 
      appears to exacerbate the effects of low baseline cFT levels that are also lower 
      than expected at follow-up. These results highlight that individual variations in 
      AR CAG repeat length should be considered in future studies and clinical trials 
      that examine the complex relationship between testosterone and cognition.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This is a retrospective study that compares mandibular growth changes 
      in skeletal Class II patients treated by rapid maxillary expansion (RME) and 
      following fixed appliance with those patients treated by Twin-Block (TB) and 
      following fixed appliance. METHODS: Fourteen patients treated by RME and 
      following fixed appliance were included into the RME group. Fifteen patients 
      treated by Twin-Block and following fixed appliance were included into the TB 
      group. Lateral cephalometric radiographs taken before treatment and immediately 
      after fixed appliance treatment were used to evaluate mandibular growth effects. 
      RESULTS: The starting forms of the patients in the two groups were examined to be 
      of good comparability. The mandibular length increased significantly in both 
      groups as measured by Co-Gn, Go-Gn and Ar-Gn, but the TB group didn't show more 
      mandibular growth than the RME group (P > 0.05). Skeletal changes of the mandible 
      in vertical dimension were different in the two groups. The change in FMA was 
      0.35 degrees  in the RME group, while the change was 2.65 degrees  in the TB group (P < 0.001). 
      The change in LAFH was 5.14 mm in the RME group, significantly smaller than the 
      change of 10.19 mm in the TB group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The investigated 
      Phase I treatment with RME followed by Phase II treatment of fixed appliance 
      achieved the same increases in sagittal mandibular growth and facial profile 
      improvements as the Twin-Block therapy. The treatment with RME followed by fixed 
      appliance was better for vertical control, while the treatment with Twin-Block 
      followed by fixed appliance significantly increased the mandibular plane angle.

TI  - Genetic analysis for carrier diagnosis in hemophilia A and B in the Mexican 
      population: 25 years of experience.
PG  - 939-954
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.c.31854 [doi]
AB  - Our 25 years of experience in carrier diagnosis of hemophilia A (HA) and B (HB) 
      in Mexican population comprises linkage analysis of intragenic F8/F9 neutral 
      variants along with, in severe HA (SHA), detection of F8 int22h and int1h 
      inversions. In symptomatic carriers (SCs) we explored Lyonization to explain 
      their symtomatology. From a DNA-Bank of 3,000 samples, intragenic restriction 
      fragment length (RFLPs) and short tandem repeats (STRs) of F8/F9 genes were 
      assessed by PCR-PAGE and GeneScan. In SHA patients, F8 inversions were detected 
      by inverse shifting-PCR/diagnostic and complementary tests. In SCs, we evaluated 
      hemorrhagic symptoms, clotting FVIII/FIX and X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) 
      patterns were assessed by HUMARA assay and the search of XIST promoter pathogenic 
      variants. Informativeness of linkage analysis for HA carrier diagnosis with 
      RFLP's/STR's increased to 74% and reached 80% with five RFLPs for HB. Combined 
      Inv22/Inv1 diagnosed 113 possible carriers, three de novo Inv22-1, and confirmed 
      45 mothers as obligate or sporadic carriers. Among 21 SCs, four showed extreme 
      skewed XCI pattern (~80:20) but had normal karyotype and no C43G pathogenic 
      variant in XIST promoter. Clotting FVIII/FIX correlated with the active X in 
      leukocytes. Our data integrate the largest comprehensive research worldwide on 
      the molecular diagnosis of HA and HB carriers in terms of the number of studied 
      and diagnosed cases, in addition to the genetic analysis in SCs. Intragenic RFLPs 
      and STRs of F8/F9 genes along with F8 int22h/int1h inversions in SHA emerge as 
      optimal variants for molecular diagnosis in Mexican population. In counseling 
      SCs, inheritance of skewed X-inactivation should be considered.

TI  - Identification of GGC repeat expansion in the NOTCH2NLC gene in amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis.
PG  - e3394-e3405
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000010945 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the GGC repeats in the NOTCH2NLC gene contribute 
      to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). METHODS: In this study, 545 patients with 
      ALS and 1,305 healthy controls from mainland China were recruited. Several 
      pathogenic mutations in known ALS-causative genes (including C9ORF72 and ATXN2) 
      and polynucleotide repeat expansions in NOP56 and AR genes were excluded. 
      Repeat-primed PCR and GC-rich PCR were performed to determine the GGC repeat size 
      in NOTCH2NLC. Systematic and targeted clinical evaluations and investigations, 
      including skin biopsy and dynamic electrophysiologic studies, were conducted in 
      the genetically affected patients. RESULTS: GGC repeat expansion was observed in 
      4 patients (numbers of repeats 44, 54, 96, and 143), accounting for  approximately 0.73% (4 of 
      545) of all patients with ALS. A comparison with 1,305 healthy controls revealed 
      that GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC was associated with ALS (Fisher exact 
      test, 4 of 545 vs 0 of 1,305, p = 0.007). Compared to patients with the neuronal 
      intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) muscle weakness-dominant subtype, patients 
      with ALS phenotype carrying the abnormal repeat expansion tended to have a severe 
      phenotype and rapid deterioration. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that ALS is a 
      specific phenotype of NIID or that GGC expansion in NOTCH2NLC is a factor that 
      modifies ALS. These findings may help clarify the pathogenic mechanism of ALS and 
      may expand the known clinical spectrum of NIID.

TI  - Identification of Potential Genes for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and Prostate 
      Cancer Susceptibility in Four X-chromosome Regions with High Frequency of 
      Microvariant Alleles.
PG  - 2271-2280
LID - 89217 [pii]
LID - 10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.8.2271 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The X-chromosome has been suggested to play a role in prostate cancer 
      (PrCa) since epidemiological studies have provided evidence for an X-linked mode 
      of inheritance for PrCa based on the higher relative risk among men who report an 
      affected brother(s) as compared to those reporting an affected father. The aim of 
      this study was to examine the potential association between the forensic STR 
      markers located at four regions Xp22.31, Xq11.2-12, Xq26.2, and Xq28 and the risk 
      of BPH and PrCa to confirm the impact of ChrX in the PrCa incidence. This may be 
      helpful in the incorporation of STRs genetic variation in the early detection of 
      men population at risk of developing PrCa. METHODS: DNA samples from 92 patients 
      and 156 healthy controls collected from two medical centers in Riyadh, Saudi 
      Arabia were analyzed for four regions located at X-chromosome using the 
      Investigator(R) Argus X-12 QS Kit. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that 
      microvariant alleles of (DXS7132, DXS10146, HPRTB, DXS10134, and DXS10135) are 
      overrepresented in the BPH group (p < 0.00001). Allele 28 of DXS10135 and allele 
      15 of DXS7423 could have a protective effect, OR 0.229 (95%CI, 0.066-0.79); and 
      OR 0.439 (95%CI, 0.208-0.925). On the other hand, patients carrying allele 23 of 
      DXS10079 and allele 26 of DXS10148 presented an increased risk to PrCa OR 4.714 
      (95%CI, 3.604-6.166). CONCLUSION: The results are in concordance with the 
      involvement of the X chromosome in PrCa and BPH development. STR allele studies 
      may add further information from the definition of a genetic profile of PrCa 
      resistance or susceptibility. As TBL1, AR, LDOC1, and RPL10 genes are located at 
      regions Xp22.31, Xq11.2-12, Xq26.2, and Xq28, respectively, these genes could 
      play an essential role in PrCa or BPH.

LID - 10.1007/978-3-030-32633-3_28 [doi]
AB  - X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), also known as Kennedy 
      syndrome, is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized by slowly 
      progressive muscle atrophy and other severe symptoms gradually leading to reduced 
      mobility and ultimately to death due to respiratory failure. Two decades ago we 
      reported the first prenatal diagnosis of SBMA worldwide. Here we present a Greek 
      family in which we have performed seven prenatal DNA tests for SBMA mutation 
      after extensive genetic counseling. Since there is not yet a cure for SBMA, 
      prenatal testing may be a good choice for couples at risk for prevention of this 
      neurodegenerative disorder in their offspring. The issues addressed during 
      genetic counseling for such a disabling disorder of adult onset are discussed as 
      a paradigm for other conditions with similar characteristics.

      AR gene.
PG  - e1207
LID - 10.1002/mgg3.1207 [doi]
LID - e1207
AB  - BACKGROUND: The androgen receptor (AR) is a nuclear receptor, encoded by the AR 
      gene on the X chromosome. Within the first exon of the AR gene, two short tandem 
      repeats (STR), CAG and GGC, are a source of polymorphism in the population. 
      Therefore, high-throughput methods for screening AR, such as next-generation 
      sequencing (NGS), are sought after; however, data generated by NGS are limited by 
      the availability of bioinformatics tools. Here, we evaluated the accuracy of the 
      bioinformatics tool HipSTR in detecting and quantify CAG repeats within the AR 
      gene. METHOD: The AR gene of 228 infertile men was sequenced using NGSgene panel. 
      Data generated were analyzed with HipSTR to detect CAG repeats. The accuracy was 
      compared with the results obtained with Sanger. RESULTS: We found that HipSTR was 
      more accurate than Sanger in genotyping normal karyotype men (46,XY), however, it 
      was more likely to misidentify homozygote genotypes in men with Klinefelter 
      syndrome (47,XXY). CONCLUSION: Our findings show that the bioinformatics tool 
      HipSTR is 100% accurate in detecting and assessing AR CAG repeats in infertile 
      men (46,XY) as well as in men with low-level mosaicism.

TI  - The role of androgen receptor CAG repeat polymorphism in androgen excess disorder 
      and idiopathic hirsutism.
PG  - 1271-1281

AB  - PURPOSE: The study aimed to investigate whether repeat number in the androgen 
      receptor (AR) gene has any contribution to phenotypes of the disease of androgen 
      excess (polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), idiopathic hyperandrogenemia (IHA) and 
      idiopathic hirsutism (IH) in a cohort of Turkish women. METHODS: Three hundred 
      and fifty-four voluntary premenopausal women (172 healthy controls and 182 
      patients with androgen excess disorders and idiopathic hirsutism) 18-45 years of 
      age seen at an outpatient endocrine clinic at Erciyes University Hospital between 
      January 2013 and December 2014 were included. All volunteers have undergone 
      physical examination and biochemical evaluation. The polymorphic (CAG)n repeat of 
      the human AR was determined by fragment analyses. RESULTS: Detailed clinical 
      analyses of the patients ended up with 137 PCOS, 24 IHA, and 21 IH. Pairwise 
      comparisons revealed the CAG repeat number differences between the PCOS and 
      controls (p = 0.005) and IH and controls (p = 0.020). Women with CAG repeat 
      length </= 17 had a significantly increased twofold risk for PCOS than those women 
      with > 17 CAG repeats OR: 2.0 (95% CI 1.2-3.3, p = 0.005). Women with CAG repeat 
      length </= 17 had a significantly increased threefold risk for IH than those women 
      with > 17 CAG repeats OR: 2.9 (95% CI 1.2-7.3, p = 0.020). When correlation 
      analysis was performed, a weak negative correlation was detected between the 
      short allele and FGS score (r = - 0.131, p = 0.013) and a positive relationship 
      between total testosterone and longer allele in the IHA group (r = 0.425, 
      p = 0.039). Median repeat length of the shorter allele between oligomenorrhea and 
      woman with normal menstrual cycle was found to be statistically significant 
      (p = 0.017). CONCLUSION: This study indicated that the risk of PCOS and IH is 
      associated with the inheritance of ARs with shorter CAG repeats.

TI  - Deterioration of muscle force and contractile characteristics are early 
      pathological events in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy mice.
LID - 10.1242/dmm.042424 [doi]
LID - dmm042424
AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), also known as Kennedy's Disease, is a 
      late-onset X-linked progressive neuromuscular disease, which predominantly 
      affects males. The pathological hallmarks of the disease are selective loss of 
      spinal and bulbar motor neurons, accompanied by weakness, atrophy and 
      fasciculations of bulbar and limb muscles. SBMA is caused by a CAG repeat 
      expansion in the gene that encodes the androgen receptor (AR) protein. Disease 
      manifestation is androgen dependent and results principally from a toxic gain of 
      AR function. There are currently no effective treatments for this debilitating 
      disease. It is important to understand the course of the disease in order to 
      target therapeutics to key pathological stages. This is especially relevant in 
      disorders such as SBMA, for which disease can be identified before symptom onset, 
      through family history and genetic testing. To fully characterise the role of 
      muscle in SBMA, we undertook a longitudinal physiological and histological 
      characterisation of disease progression in the AR100 mouse model of SBMA. Our 
      results show that the disease first manifests in skeletal muscle, before any 
      motor neuron degeneration, which only occurs in late-stage disease. These 
      findings reveal that alterations in muscle function, including reduced muscle 
      force and changes in contractile characteristics, are early pathological events 
      in SBMA mice and suggest that muscle-targeted therapeutics may be effective in 
      SBMA.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author 
      of the paper.

AB  - Spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an adult-onset, slowly progressive motor 
      neuron disease caused by abnormal CAG repeat expansion in the androgen receptor 
      (AR) gene. Although ligand (testosterone)-dependent mutant AR aggregation has 
      been shown to play important roles in motor neuronal degeneration by the analyses 
      of transgenic mice models and in vitro cell culture models, the underlying 
      disease mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated because of the discrepancy 
      between model mice and SBMA patients. Thus, novel human disease models that 
      recapitulate SBMA patients' pathology more accurately are required for more 
      precise pathophysiological analysis and the development of novel therapeutics. 
      Here, we established disease specific iPSCs from four SBMA patients, and 
      differentiated them into spinal motor neurons. To investigate motor neuron 
      specific pathology, we purified iPSC-derived motor neurons using flow cytometry 
      and cell sorting based on the motor neuron specific reporter, HB9(e438)::Venus, 
      and proceeded to the genome-wide transcriptome analysis by RNA sequences. The 
      results revealed the involvement of the pathology associated with synapses, 
      epigenetics, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in SBMA. Notably, we demonstrated the 
      involvement of the neuromuscular synapse via significant upregulation of 
      Synaptotagmin, R-Spondin2 (RSPO2), and WNT ligands in motor neurons derived from 
      SBMA patients, which are known to be associated with neuromuscular junction (NMJ) 
      formation and acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering. These aberrant gene 
      expression in neuromuscular synapses might represent a novel therapeutic target 
      for SBMA.

TI  - Polymorphisms in the androgen receptor CAG repeat sequence are related to tumour 
      stage but not to ERG or androgen receptor expression in Malaysian men with 
      prostate cancer.
PG  - 243-251
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Polymorphic expression of a CAG repeat sequence in the androgen 
      receptor (AR) gene may influence the activity of the AR and the occurrence of 
      prostate cancer and the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion event. Furthermore, this polymorphism 
      may be responsible for the ethnic variation observed in prostate cancer 
      occurrence and expression of the ERG oncogene. We investigate the expression of 
      AR and ERG in the biopsies of Malaysian men with prostate cancer and in the same 
      patients relate this to the length of the CAG repeat sequence in their AR gene. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: From a PSA screening initiative, 161 men were shown to 
      have elevated PSA levels in their blood and underwent prostatic tissue biopsy. 
      DNA was extracted from the blood, and exon 1 of the AR gene amplified by PCR and 
      sequenced. The number of CAG repeat sequences were counted and compared to the 
      immunohistochemical expression of ERG and AR in the matched tumour biopsies. 
      RESULTS: Of men with elevated PSA, 89 were diagnosed with prostate cancer, and 72 
      with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). There was no significant difference in 
      the length of the CAG repeat in men with prostate cancer and BPH. The CAG repeat 
      length was not associated with; age, PSA or tumour grade, though a longer CAG 
      repeat was associated with tumour stage. ERG and AR were expressed in 36% and 86% 
      of the cancers, respectively. There was no significant association between CAG 
      repeat length and ERG or AR expression. However, there was a significant inverse 
      relationship between ERG and AR expression. In addition, a significantly great 
      proportion of Indian men had ERG positive tumours, compared to men of Malay or 
      Chinese descent. CONCLUSIONS: CAG repeat length is not associated with prostate 
      cancer or expression of ERG or AR. However, ERG appears to be more common in the 
      prostate cancers of Malaysian Indian men than in the prostate cancers of other 
      Malaysian ethnicities and its expression in this study was inversely related to 
      AR expression.

AB  - Although the heritability of cognitive function in old age is substantial, 
      genome-wide association studies have had limited success in elucidating its 
      genetic basis, leaving a considerable amount of "missing heritability." Aside 
      from single nucleotide polymorphisms, genome-wide association studies are unable 
      to assess other large sources of genetic variation, such as tandem repeat 
      polymorphisms. Therefore, here, we studied the association of 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat variations in polyglutamine 
      disease-associated genes (PDAGs) with cognitive function in older adults. In a 
      large cohort consisting of 5786 participants, we found that the CAG repeat number 
      in 3 PDAGs (TBP, HTT, and AR) were significantly associated with the decline in 
      cognitive function, which together accounted for 0.49% of the variation. 
      Furthermore, in an magnetic resonance imaging substudy, we found that CAG repeat 
      polymorphisms in 4 PDAGs (ATXN2, CACNA1A, ATXN7, and AR) were associated with 
      different imaging characteristics, including brain stem, putamen, globus 
      pallidus, thalamus, and amygdala volumes. Our findings indicate that tandem 
      repeat polymorphisms are associated with cognitive function in older adults and 
      highlight the importance of PDAGs in elucidating its missing heritability.

AB  - Anxiety and depressive disorders are more prevalent in hypogonadal men. Low 
      testosterone levels are associated with greater negative symptoms and impaired 
      cognition in men with schizophrenia. Thus, androgens may contribute to brain 
      pathophysiology in psychiatric disorders. We investigated androgen-related mRNAs 
      in post-mortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of psychiatric disorders. We also 
      assessed androgen receptor (AR) CAG trinucleotide repeat length, a functional AR 
      gene variant associated with AR gene expression, receptor activity, and 
      circulating testosterone. AR CAG repeat length was determined from genomic DNA 
      and AR and 5alpha-reductase mRNAs measured using quantitative PCR in schizophrenia, 
      bipolar disorder and control cases [n...=...35/group; Stanley Medical Research 
      Institute (SMRI) Array collection]. Layer-specific AR gene expression was 
      determined using in situ hybridisation in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major 
      depressive disorder and control cases (n...=...15/group; SMRI Neuropathology 
      Consortium). AR mRNA was increased in bipolar disorder, but was unchanged in 
      schizophrenia, relative to controls. AR and 5alpha-reductase mRNAs were significantly 
      positively correlated in bipolar disorder. AR CAG repeat length was significantly 
      shorter in bipolar disorder relative to schizophrenia. AR mRNA expression was 
      highest in cortical layers IV and V, but no layer-specific diagnostic differences 
      were detected. Together, our results suggest enhanced cortical androgen action in 
      people with bipolar disorder.

TI  - Remodeling of Bone Marrow Hematopoietic Stem Cell Niches Promotes Myeloid Cell 
      Expansion during Premature or Physiological Aging.

AB  - Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) residing in the bone marrow (BM) accumulate 
      during aging but are functionally impaired. However, the role of HSC-intrinsic 
      and -extrinsic aging mechanisms remains debated. Megakaryocytes promote 
      quiescence of neighboring HSCs. Nonetheless, whether megakaryocyte-HSC 
      interactions change during pathological/natural aging is unclear. Premature aging 
      in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome recapitulates physiological aging 
      features, but whether these arise from altered stem or niche cells is unknown. 
      Here, we show that the BM microenvironment promotes myelopoiesis in 
      premature/physiological aging. During physiological aging, HSC-supporting niches 
      decrease near bone but expand further from bone. Increased BM noradrenergic 
      innervation promotes beta(2)-adrenergic-receptor(AR)-interleukin-6-dependent 
      megakaryopoiesis. Reduced beta(3)-AR-Nos1 activity correlates with decreased 
      endosteal niches and megakaryocyte apposition to sinusoids. However, chronic 
      treatment of progeroid mice with beta(3)-AR agonist decreases premature myeloid and 
      HSC expansion and restores the proximal association of HSCs to megakaryocytes. 
      Therefore, normal/premature aging of BM niches promotes myeloid expansion and can 
      be improved by targeting the microenvironment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Gastrointestinal cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death 
      worldwide. The aim of this study was to verify whether the genotype of six short 
      tandem repeat (STR) loci including AR, Bat-25, D5S346, ER1, ER2, and FGA is 
      associated with the risk of gastric cancer (GC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) and 
      to develop a model that allows early diagnosis and prediction of inherited 
      genomic susceptibility to GC and CRC. METHODS: Alleles of six STR loci were 
      determined using the peripheral blood of six colon cancer patients, five rectal 
      cancer patients, eight GC patients, and 30 healthy controls. Fisher linear 
      discriminant analysis (FDA) was used to establish the discriminant formula to 
      distinguish GC and CRC patients from healthy controls. Leave-one-out cross 
      validation and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to 
      validate the accuracy of the formula. The relationship between the STR status and 
      immunohistochemical (IHC) and tumor markers was analyzed using multiple 
      correspondence analysis. RESULTS: D5S346 was confirmed as a GC- and CRC-related 
      STR locus. For the first time, we established a discriminant formula on the basis 
      of the six STR loci, which was used to estimate the risk coefficient of suffering 
      from GC and CRC. The model was statistically significant (Wilks' lambda = 0.471, 
      chi2 = 30.488, df = 13, and p = 0.004). The results of leave-one-out cross 
      validation showed that the sensitivity of the formula was 73.7% and the 
      specificity was 76.7%. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.926, with a 
      sensitivity of 73.7% and a specificity of 93.3%. The STR status was shown to have 
      a certain relationship with the expression of some IHC markers and the level of 
      some tumor markers. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study complement clinical 
      diagnostic criteria and present markers for early prediction of GC and CRC. This 
      approach will aid in improving risk awareness of susceptible individuals and 
      contribute to reducing the incidence of GC and CRC by prevention and early 
      detection.

AB  - TANC1 and its close relative TANC2 are two important synaptic scaffold proteins 
      which play critical roles in regulating densities of synaptic spines and 
      excitatory synapse strength. Recent studies indicated TANC1 and TANC2 are 
      candidate genes of several neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). So far, the 
      biochemical properties of TANC1/2 proteins remain largely unknown. In this study, 
      Ankyrin-repeats (AR) domain of TANC1 was expressed and purified using Escherichia 
      coli. (E. coli.) cells, which showed low solubility and stability after removing 
      the maltose binding protein (MBP) tag. Sequence analysis revealed that the TANC1 
      AR domain is lack of canonical N, C-capping units. By introducing two point 
      mutations in the C-capping unit and replacing the N-capping unit, monomeric and 
      well-folded TANC1 AR domain was purified and characterized by size exclusion 
      chromatography coupled with multi-angle static light scattering (SEC-MALS) and 
      circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD). In addition, mutations from intellectual 
      disability (ID) patients and cancer patients were imported into the TANC1 AR 
      domain. The ID mutant exhibited marginal effects in terms of conformation and 
      protein folding stability changes. By contrast, the cancer mutants dramatically 
      decreased protein solubility. Combined with structural prediction, we speculated 
      that mis-sense variants tested in this study may either affect protein folding or 
      disrupt the interaction between TANC1/2 AR domains and their binding partners.

TI  - Possible role of androgen receptor gene in therapeutic response of infertile men 
      with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.
PG  - 326-332
LID - 10.1080/19396368.2019.1590478 [doi]
AB  - Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) is defined as a dysfunction of 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, which causes impairments in gametogenesis, 
      pubertal maturation, and/or secretion of the gonadal sex hormones. Human chronic 
      gonadotropin (hCG) stimulates the Leydig cells of the testis to secrete 
      testosterone, which is essential for spermatogenesis. Testosterone replacement 
      therapy is one of the possible options to manage HH treatment. Given the fact 
      that testosterone functions are mediated via androgen receptor (AR), the aim of 
      the present study was to evaluate whether the CAG/GGN triple repeat expansion in 
      AR gene can modulate the response to hCG and testosterone treatment in HH men. 
      Sixty-two men who diagnosed with HH and treated with testosterone and hCG were 
      assessed after treatment. They were classified into two groups, 31 subjects with 
      a positive and 31 subjects with a negative response to replacement therapy within 
      12-18 months. Androgen receptor CAG and GGN repeat numbers were measured in both 
      groups by hot start polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-sequencing technique. 
      Subjects who reached complete spermatogenesis showed the 20 and 23 as the median 
      numbers of AR CAG/GGN repeats, respectively. In individuals who did not respond 
      to treatment the median length for both CAG/GGN repeats were 23. The average of 
      CAG repeats was statistically lower in patients who had the positive response in 
      comparison to patients who did not respond to hormone therapy (p < 0.05), but the 
      length of GGN repeats were not statistically different between these groups of 
      patients (p > 0.05). The number of CAG repeats are negatively and signi fi cantly 
      associated with better hormone therapy response. Our results suggest that the 
      length of CAG repeat polymorphism in AR gene might affect the response to 
      treatment in men suffering from HH, whereas no relationship was found between AR 
      gene GGN repeat polymorphism and testosterone and hCG replacement therapy 
      response. Abbreviations: AR: androgen receptor; FSH: follicle stimulating

TI  - Sex-Specific Associations of Androgen Receptor CAG Trinucleotide Repeat Length 
      and of Raloxifene Treatment with Testosterone Levels and Perceived Stress in 
      Schizophrenia.
PG  - 28-41
LID - 10.1159/000495062 [doi]
AB  - Lower testosterone levels are associated with greater negative symptoms in men 
      with schizophrenia. Testosterone signals via androgen receptor (AR). A functional 
      variant in the AR gene (CAG trinucleotide repeat polymorphism) is associated with 
      circulating testosterone and mood-related symptoms in healthy people. Raloxifene 
      increases testosterone in healthy males and reduces symptom severity and improves 
      cognition in schizophrenia; however, whether raloxifene increases testosterone in 
      men with schizophrenia is unknown. We assessed the interaction of a functional AR 
      gene variant and adjunctive raloxifene on peripheral testosterone and symptom 
      severity in schizophrenia. Patients with schizophrenia (59 males and 38 females) 
      participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial 
      of adjunctive raloxifene (120 mg/day). Healthy adults (46 males and 41 females) 
      were used for baseline comparison. Baseline circulating testosterone was 
      decreased in male patients compared to male controls and positively correlated 
      with CAG repeat length in male controls and female patients. Male patients with 
      short, compared to long, CAG repeat length had higher stress scores. Raloxifene 
      treatment increased testosterone in male patients, but was unrelated to AR CAG 
      repeat length, suggesting that raloxifene's effects may not depend on AR 
      activity. Sex-specific alterations of the relationship between AR CAG repeat 
      length and testosterone suggest that altered AR activity may impact perceived 
      stress in men with schizophrenia.

TI  - DNA methylation inhibitor attenuates polyglutamine-induced neurodegeneration by 
      regulating Hes5.
LID - 10.15252/emmm.201708547 [doi]
LID - e8547
AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a polyglutamine-mediated 
      neuromuscular disease caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the androgen receptor 
      (AR) gene. While transcriptional dysregulation is known to play a critical role 
      in the pathogenesis of SBMA, the underlying molecular pathomechanisms remain 
      unclear. DNA methylation is a fundamental epigenetic modification that silences 
      the transcription of various genes that have a CpG-rich promoter. Here, we showed 
      that DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) is highly expressed in the spinal motor 
      neurons of an SBMA mouse model and in patients with SBMA. Both genetic Dnmt1 
      depletion and treatment with RG108, a DNA methylation inhibitor, ameliorated the 
      viability of SBMA model cells. Furthermore, a continuous intracerebroventricular 
      injection of RG108 mitigated the phenotype of SBMA mice. DNA methylation array 
      analysis identified hairy and enhancer of split 5 (Hes5) as having a CpG island 
      with hyper-methylation in the promoter region, and the Hes5 expression was 
      strongly silenced in SBMA. Moreover, Hes5 over-expression rescued the SBMA cells 
      possibly by inducing Smad2 phosphorylation. Our findings suggest DNA 
      hyper-methylation underlies the neurodegeneration in SBMA.

AB  - Spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion 
      in the androgen receptor gene on the X chromosome. There is a toxic effect of the 
      mutant receptor on muscle and neurons resulting in muscle weakness and atrophy. 
      The weakness can be explained by wasting due to loss of muscle cells, but it is 
      unknown whether weakness also relates to poor muscle contractility of the 
      remaining musculature. In this study, we investigated the muscle contractility in 
      SBMA. We used stationary dynamometry and quantitative MRI to assess muscle 
      strength and absolute and fat-free, cross-sectional areas. Specific muscle force 
      (strength per cross-sectional area) and contractility (strength per fat-free 
      cross-sectional area) were compared with healthy controls and their relation to 
      walking distance and disease severity was investigated. Specific force was 
      reduced by 14-49% in SBMA patients compared to healthy controls. Contractility 
      was reduced by 22-39% in elbow flexion, knee extension, ankle dorsi- and 
      plantarflexion in SBMA patients. The contractility decreased with increasing 
      muscle fat content in muscles with affected contractility in SBMA. The decreased 
      muscle contractility in SBMA may relate to motor neuron degeneration and changed 
      fibre type distribution and muscle architecture.

TI  - Prevalence of metabolic syndrome and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in a 
      cohort of italian patients with spinal-bulbar muscular atrophy.
PG  - 204-209
AB  - Spinal-bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), is an X-linked motor neuron disease caused 
      by a CAG-repeat expansion in the first exon of the androgen receptor gene (AR) on 
      chromosome X. In SBMA, non-neural clinical phenotype includes disorders of 
      glucose and lipid metabolism. We investigated the prevalence of metabolic 
      syndrome (MS), insulin resistance (IR) and non alcoholic fatty liver disease 
      (NAFLD) in a group of SBMA patients. Forty-seven consecutive patients genetically 
      diagnosed with SBMA underwent biochemical analyses. In 24 patients abdominal 
      sonography examination was performed. Twenty-three (49%) patients had fasting 
      glucose above reference values and 31 (66%) patients had a homeostatic model 
      assessment (HOMA-IR) >/= 2.6. High levels of total cholesterol were found in 24 
      (51%) patients, of LDL-cholesterol in 18 (38%) and of triglycerides in 18 (38%). 
      HDL-cholesterol was decreased in 36 (77%) patients. Twenty-four (55%) subjects 
      had 3 or more criteria of MS. A positive correlation (r = 0.52; p < 0.01) was 
      observed between HOMA-IR and AR-CAG repeat length. AST and ALT were above the 
      reference values respectively in 29 (62%) and 18 (38%) patients. At ultrasound 
      examination increased liver echogenicity was found in 22 patients (92 %). In one 
      patient liver cirrhosis was diagnosed. Liver/kidney ratio of grey-scale 
      intensity, a semi-quantitative parameter of severity of steatosis, strongly 
      correlated with BMI (r = 0.68; p < 0.005). Our study shows a high prevalence of 
      IR, MS and NAFLD in SBMA patients, conditions that increase the cardiovascular 
      risk and can lead to serious liver damage, warranting pharmacological and 
      non-pharmacological treatment.

TI  - Gene expression analysis reveals early dysregulation of disease pathways and 
      links Chmp7 to pathogenesis of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.

AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) results from a CAG repeat expansion 
      within the androgen receptor gene (AR). It is unclear why motor neurons 
      selectively degenerate and there are currently no treatments for this 
      debilitating disease. To uncover the causative genes and pathways involved in 
      motor neuron dysfunction, we undertook transcriptomic profiling of primary 
      embryonic motor neurons from SBMA mice. We show that transcriptional 
      dysregulation occurs early during development in SBMA motor neurons. One gene 
      found to be dysregulated, Chmp7, was also altered in vivo in spinal cord before 
      symptom onset in SBMA mice, and crucially in motor neuron precursor cells derived 
      from SBMA patient stem cells, suggesting that Chmp7 may play a causal role in 
      disease pathogenesis by disrupting the endosome-lysosome system. Furthermore, 
      genes were enriched in SBMA motor neurons in several key pathways including p53, 
      DNA repair, WNT and mitochondrial function. SBMA embryonic motor neurons also 
      displayed dysfunctional mitochondria along with DNA damage, possibly resulting 
      from DNA repair gene dysregulation and/or mitochondrial dysfunction. This 
      indicates that a coordinated dysregulation of multiple pathways leads to 
      development of SBMA. Importantly, our findings suggest that the identified 
      pathways and genes, in particular Chmp7, may serve as potential therapeutic 
      targets in SBMA.

TI  - Large normal alleles of ATXN2 decrease age at onset in transthyretin familial 
      amyloid polyneuropathy Val30Met patients.
PG  - 251-258
LID - 10.1002/ana.25409 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Transthyretin (TTR)-related familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) is 
      an autosomal dominant neurological disease, caused most frequently by a Val30Met 
      (now classified as Val50Met) substitution in TTR. Age at onset (AO) ranges from 
      19 to 82 years, and variability exists mostly between generations. Unstable 
      oligonucleotide repeats in various genes are the mechanism behind several 
      neurological diseases, found also to act as modifiers for other disorders. Our 
      aim was to investigate whether large normal repeat alleles of 10 genes had a 
      possible modifier effect in AO in Portuguese TTR-FAP Val30Met families. METHODS: 
      We analyzed 329 Portuguese patients from 123 families. Repeat length (at ATXN1, 
      ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, TBP, ATN1, HTT, JPH3, AR, and DMPK) was assessed by single 
      and multiplex polymerase chain reaction, using fluorescently labeled primers, 
      followed by capillary electrophoresis. We used a family-centered approach, and 
      generalized estimating equations were used to account for AO correlation between 
      family members. RESULTS: For ATXN2, the presence of at least 1 allele longer than 
      22 CAGs was significantly associated with an earlier onset in TTR-FAP Val30Met, 
      decreasing mean AO by 6 years (95% confidence interval = -8.81 to -2.19, p = 
      0.001). No association was found for the remaining repeat loci. INTERPRETATION: 
      Length of normal repeats at ATXN2 may modify AO in TTR-FAP Val30Met and may 
      function as a risk factor. This can be due to the role of ATXN2 in RNA metabolism 
      and as a modulator of various cellular processes, including mitochondrial stress. 
      This may have relevant implications for prognosis and the follow-up of 
      presymptomatic carriers. ANN NEUROL 2019;85:251-258.

AB  - Kennedy's disease, resulted from the expansion of a CAG repeat in exon 1 of 
      androgen receptor (AR) gene, is a motor neuron degenerative disease in the 
      brainstem and spinal cord with the slow development of facial, bulbar, and limb 
      muscle degeneration. To investigate the clinical manifestations and gene 
      mutations in Han Chinese patients with Kennedy's disease. The clinical 
      manifestations of 5 male Han Chinese patients including 2 probands and their 
      relatives from 2 families and 1 sporadic case were retrospectively studied. The 
      CAG repeats in the first exon of AR were screened in 5 Han Chinese people 
      including 2 probands and their healthy relatives from 2 families and 1 sporadic 
      case by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing. The average age at 
      onset of Kennedy's disease was 48.20 +/- 8.70 (mean +/- SD) years and the average 
      duration was 7.60 +/- 5.32 years. All the patients showed slow onset and 
      progressive weakness, wasting, and fasciculations of the whole body. Four 
      patients demonstrated decreased fertility and 1 patient showed mild gynecomastia. 
      Serum creatine kinase and testosterone levels were elevated mildly in 2 and 1 
      patients, respectively. The electromyogram showed neurogenic abnormalities. 
      Muscle magnetic resonance demonstrated reduced muscle volume and fatty 
      infiltration. Three different enlarged CAG domains were discovered in the 2 
      families and 1 sporadic patient with Kennedy's disease, and the CAG repeat number 
      was 48, 43, and 44, respectively. The clinical manifestations of Kennedy's 
      disease in Han Chinese middle-aged men were progressive weakness and atrophy in 
      the bulbar and spinal muscles, occasionally demonstrating incomplete androgen 
      insensitivity syndrome. These patients were also characterized with enlarged CAG 
      repeat number in the first exon of AR, indicating that CAG number could be used 
      in the diagnosis of Han Chinese patients with Kennedy's disease.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The effect of testosterone depends on the exposure of and the 
      sensitivity of the androgen receptor (AR). It has been shown that a 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) trinucleotide repeat polymorphism in the AR gene 
      has an impact on AR functional capacity in men. However, large studies are 
      lacking on the impact of this polymorphism on female sexual function. AIM: To 
      determine whether the CAG repeat length was associated with different aspects of 
      women's sexual function and dysfunction, including desire, arousal, lubrication, 
      orgasm, satisfaction, sexual pain, and sexually related personal distress. 
      METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 529 healthy women, aged 19-65 years. 
      Participants completed a questionnaire to provide demographic and sexual data. 
      The CAG repeat length was analyzed in a blood sample. The correlations between 
      CAG repeat lengths and different aspects of sexual function were calculated. 
      Independent Student t-tests were performed to evaluate differences in the mean 
      number of CAG repeats in the short and long allele and of the biallelic mean 
      length determined by simple calculation and X-inactivation analysis, 
      respectively, between women with sexual problems and women without sexual 
      problems. P values <.05 were considered statistically significant. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURE: We used the Female Sexual Function Index, with 6 subdomains, to 
      distinguish between women without and women with impaired sexual function; low 
      sexual desire; impaired arousal, lubrication, or orgasm; diminished satisfaction; 
      or pain during sex. The Female Sexual Distress Scale was used to measure sexually 
      related personal distress. RESULTS: Overall, we found that increasing numbers of 
      CAG repeats were correlated to increased sexual function. We found that women 
      with problems achieving orgasm had a significantly lower number of CAG repeats 
      than women that reported no problems reaching orgasm. We found no associations 
      between CAG repeat lengths and other aspects of female sexual dysfunction, 
      including hypoactive sexual desire disorder. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The results 
      could indicate an impact of the AR on women's sexual function, including the 
      ability to reach orgasm. STRENGTH & LIMITATIONS: This is a large study using 
      validated sexual questionnaires. A limitation is the cross-sectional design. 
      Owing to the study design, this study is explorative and hypothesis generating. 
      CONCLUSION: In this large cross-sectional study, we demonstrated that CAG repeat 
      length is positively correlated to sexual function and that women with a reduced 
      ability to reach orgasm had smaller numbers of CAG repeats in the AR gene than 
      women with no orgasmic problems. These findings indicated that androgens and ARs 
      might play a role in women's sexual function. Wahlin-Jacobsen S, Flanagan JN,

TI  - Insights into the genetic epidemiology of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy: 
      prevalence estimation and multiple founder haplotypes in the Veneto Italian 
      region.
PG  - 519-524

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Literature data on spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy 
      (SBMA) epidemiology are limited and restricted to specific populations. The aim 
      of our study was to accurately collect information about SBMA patients living in 
      the Veneto region in Italy to compute reliable epidemiological data. Androgen 
      receptor (AR) lineages were genotyped to evaluate the presence of a founder 
      effect. METHODS: A prevalence survey considering all SBMA patients diagnosed in 
      the Italian Veneto region on 31 January 2018 was carried out. The presence of 
      different haplotypes obtained genotyping 15 polymorphic markers (single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms and short tandem repeats) around the AR gene was 
      evaluated. RESULTS: Based on 68 patients, the punctual prevalence of the disease 
      on 31 January 2018 was 2.58/100 000 (95% confidence interval 1.65-3.35) in the 
      male population. Five different haplotypes were identified, confirming the 
      existence of multiple founder effects. It was also observed that, within the same 
      haplotype, patients had a similar CAG repeat number (P-value < 0.001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: A reliable estimation of SBMA prevalence in the Italian Veneto 
      region was calculated which does not seem to be affected by a strong founder 
      effect. Moreover, our data suggest that the length of the CAG expansion could be 
      preserved in patients harbouring the same haplotype.

AB  - Genomewide association studies (GWASs) have contributed greatly to unraveling the 
      genetic basis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, a large amount of "missing 
      heritability" remains. In this exploratory study, we investigated the effect of 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeats in polyglutamine disease-associated genes 
      (PDAGs) on the risk of AD and its expression. In a cohort of 959 patients 
      diagnosed with AD (Amsterdam Dementia cohort) and 4106 cognitively healthy 
      participants (Leiden 85-plus Study and the Prospective Study of Pravastatin in 
      the Elderly at Risk), we determined the CAG repeat sequences in ATXN1, ATXN2, 
      ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, HTT, ATN1, and AR. We did not find a significant 
      association between the risk of AD and variations in CAG repeat numbers of PDAGs. 
      However, we found that differences in CAG repeat numbers in ATXN1, ATXN2, and AR 
      were significantly associated with several clinical and imaging features in AD 
      patients. Specifically, the association between memory performance in patients 
      with AD and the CAG repeat size in the longer ATXN1 allele, and the association 
      between atrophy in the medial temporal lobes and the CAG repeat number in the 
      longer AR allele remained significant after correction for multiple testing. Our 
      findings suggest that repeat polymorphisms in ATXN1 and AR can act as important 
      genetic modifiers of AD, warranting further scrutiny of their role in its missing 
      heritability and pathogenesis.

AB  - CONTEXT: There is a likely genetic component to gender dysphoria, but association 
      study data have been equivocal. OBJECTIVE: We explored the specific hypothesis 
      that gender dysphoria in transgender women is associated with variants in sex 
      hormone-signaling genes responsible for undermasculinization and/or feminization. 
      DESIGN: Subject-control analysis included 380 transgender women and 344 control 
      male subjects. Associations and interactions were investigated between functional 
      variants in 12 sex hormone-signaling genes and gender dysphoria in transgender 
      women. SETTING: Patients were recruited from the Monash Gender Clinic, Monash 
      Health, Melbourne, Australia, and the University of California, Los Angeles. 
      PATIENTS: Caucasian (non-Latino) transgender women were recruited who received a 
      diagnosis of transsexualism [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
      Disorders (DSM)-IV) or gender dysphoria (DSM-V)] pre- or postoperatively. Most 
      were receiving hormone treatment at the time of recruitment. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURED: Genomic DNA was genotyped for repeat length polymorphisms or single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms. RESULTS: A significant association was identified 
      between gender dysphoria and ERalpha, SRD5A2, and STS alleles, as well as ERalpha and 
      SULT2A1 genotypes. Several allele combinations were also overrepresented in 
      transgender women, most involving AR (namely, AR-ERbeta, AR-PGR, AR-COMT, 
      CYP17-SRD5A2). Overrepresented alleles and genotypes are proposed to 
      undermasculinize/feminize on the basis of their reported effects in other disease 
      contexts. CONCLUSION: Gender dysphoria may have an oligogenic component, with 
      several genes involved in sex hormone-signaling contributing.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of 
      tooth-borne acrylic-bonded rapid maxillary expansion (RME) appliances with or 
      without the anterior teeth anchorage on the skeletal and dentoalveolar 
      structures, as well as soft tissues. METHODS: This study included 44 patients who 
      were treated with two different tooth-borne bonded acrylic RME appliances. 
      Lateral cephalometric radiographs were taken before the treatment (T0) and in the 
      post-retention (T1) phase of the RME treatment. The posterior-bonded RME 
      appliance group and full-bonded RME appliance group were created as the two 
      different groups of treatment. The following statistical analyses were performed: 
      intra- and inter-group comparisons were made using the paired t-test, Wilcoxon 
      test, independent t-test, and Mann-Whitney U-test for normal and non-normal 
      distribution data. RESULTS: Significant increases were observed in R1-A, R1-ANS, 
      R1-U1, R1-AR, R1-St, R1-Li, and R1-Pn in both groups. R1-PNS, R1-Ls, R1-Sn, and 
      R1-B' were found to be significantly larger at T1 than at T0 in the 
      posterior-bonded RME appliance group. R2-A, R2-ANS, R2-L1, R2-A', and R2-Pn were 
      significantly larger at T1 than at T0 in the full-bonded RME appliance group. The 
      R2-A' was significantly different between the groups. CONCLUSION: The soft tissue 
      A point appears to be the most important differing matter between the two 
      different RME appliances, and a full acrylic-bonded RME appliance may be 
      beneficial for subjects with a maxillary retrognathic profile.

AB  - Peculiar cognitive profile of patients with SBMA has been described by fragmented 
      literature. Our retrospective study reports the neuropsychological evaluations of 
      a large cohort of patients in order to contribute towards the understanding of 
      this field. We consider 64 neuropsychological evaluations assessing mnesic, 
      linguistic and executive functions collected from 2013 to 2015 in patients 
      attending at Motor Neuron Disease Centre of University of Padova. The battery 
      consisted in: Digit Span forwards and backwards, Prose Memory test, Phonemic 
      Verbal fluency and Trail making tests. ANCOVA statistics were employed to compare 
      tests scores results with those obtained from a sample of healthy control 
      subjects. Multiple linear regressions were used to study the effect on cognitive 
      performance of CAG-repeat expansion, the degree of androgen insensitivity and 
      their interaction to cognitive performance. Statistical analyses did not reveal 
      altered scores in any neuropsychological tests among those adopted. 
      Interestingly, patients performed significantly better in the Prose Memory test's 
      score. No relevant associations were found with genetic, hormonal or clinical 
      patients' profile. Results inconsistent with previous studies have been 
      interpreted according to the phenomenon of somatic mosaicism. We suggest a 
      testosterone-related and the mood state-dependant perspectives as two possible 
      interpretations of the enhanced performances in the Prose Memory test. Further 
      studies employing more datailed tests batteries are encouraged.

TI  - Microsatellite variation of ESR1, ESR2, and AR in Serbian women with primary 
      ovarian insufficiency.
PG  - 472-477
LID - 10.1080/13697137.2018.1476967 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the potential role of microsatellite 
      polymorphisms of the estrogen receptor alpha gene (ESR1) TA repeat, estrogen 
      receptor beta gene (ESR2) CA repeat, and androgen receptor gene (AR) CAG and GGN 
      repeats among Serbian women with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). These 
      microsatellites have been reported to be associated with POI in different 
      racial/ethnic populations. METHODS: A cohort of 196 POI cases matched with 544 
      fertile controls was recruited by the Institute for Endocrinology, Diabetes and 
      Metabolic Disorders of Serbia between 2007 and 2010. DNA was extracted from 
      saliva. The four microsatellites were genotyped using a PCR-based assay to 
      determine the repeat lengths. RESULTS: POI patients carried shorter repeat 
      lengths of ESR2 (CA)(n) than controls (P = 0.034), but the difference was small. 
      ESR1 (TA)(n) was on the borderline of statistical differences between groups 
      (P = 0.059). AR (CAG)(n) and (GGN)(n) showed no association with POI. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We cautiously conclude that microsatellite polymorphisms of gonadal 
      steroid receptor genes might contribute to the genetic basis of POI in Serbian 
      women, but a larger-scale study and family-based studies are warranted to 
      validate our findings even though the sample size in this study is larger than 
      any previously published in this field.

TI  - Study of trinucleotide expansions and expression of androgen receptor in

AB  - Androgen receptor (AR) mediates androgen activities such as the growth of 
      accessory sex organs, and initiation and promotion of spermatogenesis. There are 
      two trinucleotide polymorphisms (CAG and GGN repeats) in the first exon of AR 
      gene that their association with infertility is still controversial. The variants 
      of both polymorphic repeats were investigated by PCR-Sequencing in 220 infertile 
      men (80 azoospermic, 60 oligospermic and 80 asthenospermic) and 80 healthy 
      fertile controls. AR Expression level was quantified by RT-qPCR on 30 patients 
      (20 patients with nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA) and 10 obstructive azoospermia 
      patients as controls). Our results demonstrated that the medians of CAG and GGN 
      repeats length in infertile group were significantly higher than fertile men 
      (p < 0.05). AR expression results showed a significant increase in SCOS group 
      compared to control (p < 0.05). Long stretches of tandem repeats of AR gene may 
      negatively affect the function of the gene and consequently lead to male 
      infertility. In patients with SCOS, AR expression increases because of the lack 
      of germ cells. Therefore, with increasing AR expression, the probability of SCOS 
      occurrence is also increased. It can be concluded that increasing AR expression 
      in testes tissue decreases the probability of sperm presence.

TI  - Germline Mutations and Polymorphisms of Androgen Receptor in Prostate Cancer 
      Patients: Frequency and Results of in Silico Analysis.
PG  - 2241-2245
AB  - Background: Germline and somatic polymorphisms and mutations of the Androgen 
      Receptor (AR) gene are known to be associated with the incidence of prostate 
      cancer (PCa) in different populations. In this study we assessed germline AR 
      polymorphisms and mutations in PCa patients with prediction of pathogenicity of 
      the identified mutations by in silico analysis. Methods: Diagnosis of PCa was 
      based on histopathology of prostate tissue (Gleason Score criteria) and serum 
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral 
      blood of 38 patients. All exons and exon-intron boundaries of AR were amplified 
      using polymerase chain reactions (PCR) followed by Sanger sequencing. In silico 
      analysis was performed using Polyphen-2 and Mutation Taster(R). Results: Two 
      polymorphisms, CAG repeat sequence (13-34 repeats in length) and p.Pro214Glu 
      (MAF: 0.0789) located in exon 1 were identified. A missense mutation 
      (c.47C>A/p.Pro146Glu) and in-frame deletion of a CAG sequence leading to loss of 
      Arginine at codon 85 (c.252_254delCAG/p.Arg85-) were identified in a 70 year old 
      patient with a Gleason Score and PSA level of 2 and 2.4ng/dL, respectively. His 
      PSA level decreased to < 0.5 ng/dL after 9 months of androgen deprivation 
      therapy. Identified mutations were predicted to be non-disease causing by 
      Polyphen-2 and Mutation Taster(R). Conclusion: Our data demonstrated that the 
      frequency of germline mutations of AR was low in PCa patients in Indonesia 
      (5.26%: 2/38 alleles), so that they are not likely to be major etiological 
      factors. The in silico analysis of identified AR mutations in this study 
      corroborated the clinopathology features of the patient.

TI  - Repeat length variations in polyglutamine disease-associated genes affect body 
      mass index.
PG  - 440-449
LID - 10.1038/s41366-018-0161-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The worldwide prevalence of obesity, a major risk factor for numerous 
      debilitating chronic disorders, is increasing rapidly. Although a substantial 
      amount of the variation in body mass index (BMI) is estimated to be heritable, 
      the largest meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to date 
      explained only ~2.7% of the variation. To tackle this 'missing heritability' 
      problem of obesity, here we focused on the contribution of DNA repeat length 
      polymorphisms which are not detectable by GWAS. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We 
      determined the cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat length in the nine known 
      polyglutamine disease-associated genes (ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, 
      HTT, ATN1 and AR) in two large cohorts consisting of 12,457 individuals and 
      analyzed their association with BMI, using generalized linear mixed-effect 
      models. RESULTS: We found a significant association between BMI and the length of 
      CAG repeats in seven polyglutamine disease-associated genes (including ATXN1, 
      ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP and AR). Importantly, these repeat variations 
      could account for 0.75% of the total BMI variation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings 
      incriminate repeat polymorphisms as an important novel class of genetic risk 
      factors of obesity and highlight the role of the brain in its pathophysiology.

TI  - Polymorphism of the androgen receptor gene CAG repeat sequence and male 
      climacteric syndrome.
PG  - 915-921
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the association between polymorphism of the 
      androgen receptor (AR) gene CAG repeat sequence and the climacteric syndrome in 
      men. The study was performed in 103 males with climacteric syndrome and 111 males 
      without the clinical syndrome of climacteric, aged between 40 and 70 years. DNA 
      sequencing of the CAG repeat sequence in the N-terminal domain of the first exon 
      of the AR gene was analyzed. The AR allele length ranged from 18-34 CAG repeats 
      in males with climacteric syndrome. The average value of CAG repeat was 
      24.7+/-2.58. However, the corresponding values ranged from 15-24 CAG repeat in 
      control group and the average value of CAG repeat was 21.25+/-2.63. There was a 
      significant difference of the number of CAG repeat between the two groups. The 
      occurrence of male climacteric syndrome was related to the CAG repeat number of 
      androgen receptor gene, and the male patients with more CAG repeats had higher 
      risk of clinical syndrome of climacteric. The detection of CAG repeat number of 
      AR gene might be helpful for the prediction of clinical syndrome of climacteric.

TI  - Serotonin transporter (5-HTTLPR) genotypes and trinucleotide repeats of androgen 
      receptor exert a combinatorial effect on hormonal milieu in patients with 
      lifelong premature ejaculation.
PG  - 916-926
LID - 10.1111/andr.12518 [doi]
AB  - Premature ejaculation is one of the most common sexual disorders in men due to 
      uncontrolled modulation of spinal reflexes controlled by cortico-limbic centers 
      in the brain. In this study, we investigate the combinatorial effects of 
      trinucleotide repeats of androgen receptor and allelic variants of the 5-HTTLPR 
      gene on sex steroids, hypophyseal hormones, sexual performance, and premature 
      ejaculation assessment parameters among evidence-based lifelong premature 
      ejaculation subjects. A total of 271 outpatients (age 26.6 +/- 1.9) consulting for 
      evidence-based lifelong premature ejaculatory dysfunction were selected in this 
      study. The control group consists of 155 men with normal IELT (>4 min). The study 
      revealed that the subjects who have the highest (>/=26) CAG stretches depicted a 
      significantly higher serum oxytocin levels (102.1 pg/ml; n = 126, p < 0.001) 
      compared with the control group (71.2 pg/ml; n = 75, p = <0.001) and patients 
      which have medium (22-25) and short (</=21) CAG stretches (76.63 ng/ml; n = 64, 
      p < 0.001 vs. 77.4 ng/ml; n = 81, p < 0.001). Almost 33 (26.1%) lifelong 
      premature ejaculatory patients had AR variant of longer (>/=26) CAG repeats was 
      homozygous for S alleles (SS), 45 (35.7%) was homozygous for L allele (LL), and 
      48 (38%) had the L/S or S/L genotype of 5-HTTLPR gene. Homozygous (SS) alleles 
      have a significant positive correlation (r = 0.44, p < 0.0001) with the high 
      score of BDI-II (39.1, n = 126, p < 0.001). However, LL alleles have shown a 
      significant positive correlation with PEDT (r = 0.46, p < 0.001) and negative 
      correlation with self-estimated IELT and intercourse satisfaction (r = -0.35, 
      p < 0.001). The innovative study design elaborates that androgen receptor 
      trinucleotide repeats and 5-HTTLPR genotypes have combinatorial impact on 
      hormonal milieu and sexual function regarding evidence-based lifelong premature 
      ejaculatory dysfunction patients.

TI  - Testosterone in renal transplant patients: effect on body composition and 
      clinical parameters.
PG  - 775-783
LID - 10.1007/s40620-018-0513-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical studies have demonstrated that, after renal transplantation 
      (TX), testosterone deficiency (TD) at the time of the procedure is independently 
      associated with lower survival of the patient and graft. However, data between TD 
      and the functional CAG polymorphism of the androgen receptor promoter (AR) are 
      discordant. We investigated the prevalence of TD and its association with body 
      composition, biochemical parameters, the Aging Males' Symptoms rating scale (AMS) 
      domains and AR polymorphism. METHODS: In 112 TX patients, we assessed the AMS, 
      biochemical/hormonal (FSH/LH/TT) anthropometric/bioimpedance analysis parameters, 
      and AR CAG polymorphism of AR by gene sequencing. RESULTS: Median values of total 
      testosterone (TT) were 340 ng/dl and 52% of TX patients were affected by TD. 
      Significant correlations between TT and FSH and FSH and LH (p = 0.005, 
      p < 0.0001, respectively) were found. TD patients had lower estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate (eGFR) and hemoglobin (Hb) (p = 0.034, p = 0.022 respectively) 
      and showed higher values of C-reactive protein (p = 0.023) and fat tissue 
      index/adipose tissue mass (p = 0.034 and p = 0.021, respectively), and lower 
      values of serum albumin (p = 0.003) and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol 
      (p = 0.038) levels. Significant differences were found in the number of patients 
      on mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors immunosuppressant therapy 
      (p = 0.045). Logistic regression analysis did not show any correlation between 
      age, AMS scores, TT or CAG repeat length, gonadotropins, time of the transplant, 
      and dialysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that in TX recipients an 
      appropriate sexual hormonal evaluation should be performed, as we found a high 
      prevalence of TD. However, further studies are needed to clarify the association 
      between TD and patient and graft survival.

TI  - Association between androgen receptor polymorphic CAG and GGC repeat lengths and 
      cryptorchidism: A meta-analysis of case-control studies.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have revealed the relationship between androgen 
      receptor (AR) CAG and/or GGC polymorphisms and risk of cryptorchidism, yet the 
      results have been elusive and controversial. AIM: To determine whether AR 
      polymorphic CAG and/or GGC repeats are related to cryptorchidism. STUDY DESIGN: 
      The relevant studies were obtained from PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge 
      Infrastructure, and Wanfang. The pooled odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals 
      (CIs) were used to assess the strength of associations. Subgroup analyses were 
      performed based on ethnicity and source of controls. Moreover, Begg's funnel 
      plots and Egger's linear regression test were conducted to determine publication 
      bias. RESULTS: Eight case-control studies containing 321 patients and 784 normal 
      controls were included. There was a significant association between longer CAG 
      repeats and cryptorchidism risk (weighted mean difference (WMD) = 0.62; 95% CIs 
      0.06, 1.18; P = 0.031). Moreover, there was a significant association between the 
      longer GGC repeats and cryptorchidism risk (WMD = 0.87; 95% CIs 0.04, 1.74; 
      P = 0.040). There was significant association between the longer CAG repeats and 
      bilateral cryptorchidism (WMD = 0.88; 95% CIs -0.18, 1.94; P = 0.011), while 
      there was no significant association between the longer CAG repeats and 
      unilateral cryptorchidism (WMD = -0.09; 95% CIs -0.50, 0.31; P = 0.554). There 
      were significant associations between the longer GGC repeats and unilateral 
      cryptorchidism (WMD = 0.88; 95% CIs -0.30, 2.05; P = 0.005) and bilateral 
      cryptorchidism (WMD = 1.35; 95% CIs -0.52, 3.21; P = 0.000). Stratifying analysis 
      revealed an association between longer CAG/GGC repeats and cryptorchidism in 
      Caucasian populations from Europe (WMD = 0.73; 95% CIs 0.00, 1.46; P = 0.017), 
      while there was no association with Asian populations. DISCUSSION: This 
      meta-analysis found that CAG/GGC repeats in the AR gene were longer in 
      cryptorchidism patients compared to controls. Both the longer CAG repeats and GGC 
      repeats in the AR gene were associated with cryptorchidism risk. The longer CAG 
      repeats were associated with bilateral cryptorchidism, whereas the longer GGC 
      repeats were associated with unilateral and bilateral cryptorchidism. Stratifying 
      analysis revealed an association between longer CAG/GGC repeats and 
      cryptorchidism in Caucasian populations from Europe, while there was no 
      association between longer CAG/GGC repeats and cryptorchidism in Asian 
      populations. CONCLUSION: The CAG/GGC repeats in the AR gene were longer in 
      cryptorchidism than in controls. Longer CAG repeats may play a role in 
      determining bilateral cryptorchidism, and longer GGC repeats may play a role in 
      determining unilateral and bilateral cryptorchidism. These observations were more 
      applicable to Caucasian populations.

AB  - The AR (androgen receptor) polymorphism is associated with POR risk. Furthermore, 
      the use of androgens in POR remains controversial. Our data could clarify the 
      effectiveness of androgen pretreatment. AR genotyping could help us to identify 
      patients at risk for POR and POR patients that will be benefited of androgen 
      pretreatment. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this project was to investigate if the AR 
      (androgen receptor) polymorphism could be used to identify patients at risk for 
      POR and that will benefit from androgens pretreatment. STUDY DESIGN: To evaluate 
      the POR risk we performed a cohort study including 231 patients (54 POR and 177 
      control). Moreover, we included 88 IVF-cycles performed by 44 POR-patients to 
      assess the effect on ovarian response. All patients performed two cycles: a 
      standard ovarian stimulation and a second one with androgen preparation. We 
      compare the results in pair from each. RESULTS: POR showed the highest frequency 
      of CAG repeats at 24 vs 22 in controls. Only 33% of POR have alleles with a 
      repeat number below 23, compared with 50% of controls (p...<...0.05). According to AR 
      polymorphism ovarian response differences were shown. Patients that carried CAG 
      repeats in AR gene between 22 and 24 showed an increased in the number of oocytes 
      (2.61 in cycles without androgens vs 5.11 when they were pretreated with 
      androgens; p...<...0.05). For the patients that carried repeats lower than 22 and 
      higher than 24, no differences were reported in the number of oocytes obtained in 
      the cycle with or without androgens (2.94 vs 2.56; p...=...0.88). Similar results 
      were obtained for mature oocytes in patients that carry a number of CAG repeats 
      between 22 and 24 (1.86 MII in cycles without androgens vs 4.04 MII when they 
      were pretreated with androgens; p...<...0.05). No differences in the number of MII 
      oocytes were found in patients that get out of 22 and 24 repeats between the two 
      cycles (2.31 vs 2.13; p...=...0.88). CONCLUSION: The AR polymorphism is associated 
      with POR risk, patients with repeats greater than 22 show a higher risk. Our data 
      suggest that AR genotype could play a role in natural ovarian aging. Furthermore, 
      the use of androgens in POR remains controversial. Our data suggest that the AR 
      genotype could clarify the effectiveness of the androgen pretreatment. AR 
      genotyping could help us to identify patients at risk of POR and POR patients 
      that could benefit from transdermal testosterone pretreatment.

AB  - Skeletal muscle has emerged as a critical, disease-relevant target tissue in 
      spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, a degenerative disorder of the neuromuscular 
      system caused by a CAG/polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion in the androgen receptor 
      (AR) gene. Here, we used RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) to identify pathways that are 
      disrupted in diseased muscle using AR113Q knockin mice. This analysis 
      unexpectedly identified substantially diminished expression of numerous 
      ubiquitin/proteasome pathway genes in AR113Q muscle, encoding approximately 30% 
      of proteasome subunits and 20% of E2 ubiquitin conjugases. These changes were 
      age, hormone, and glutamine length dependent and arose due to a toxic gain of 
      function conferred by the mutation. Moreover, altered gene expression was 
      associated with decreased levels of the proteasome transcription factor NRF1 and 
      its activator DDI2 and resulted in diminished proteasome activity. Ubiquitinated 
      ADRM1 was detected in AR113Q muscle, indicating the occurrence of stalled 
      proteasomes in mutant mice. Finally, diminished expression of Drosophila 
      orthologues of NRF1 or ADRM1 promoted the accumulation of polyQ AR protein and 
      increased toxicity. Collectively, these data indicate that AR113Q muscle develops 
      progressive proteasome dysfunction that leads to the impairment of quality 
      control and the accumulation of polyQ AR protein, key features that contribute to 
      the age-dependent onset and progression of this disorder.

TI  - The relation between isolated micropenis in childhood with CAG and GGN repeat 
      polymorphisms in the androgen receptor gene.
PG  - 430-434
LID - 10.3906/sag-1710-183 [doi]
AB  - Background/aim: In micropenis cases accompanied by external genital abnormalities 
      such as hypospadias and cryptorchidism, infertility and spermatogenic failures 
      have been reported to correlate with androgen receptor ( AR ) gene CAG and GGN 
      repeat polymorphisms. While there is one study on isolated micropenis and CAG 
      repeats, no study related to GGN repeats has been reported. We investigated the 
      relation between CAG and GGN repeats in the AR gene with development of penis 
      length in boys with isolated micropenis. Materials and methods: A total of 24 
      Turkish boys with isolated micropenis (<-2.5 SD) and 64 healthy controls who had 
      normal basal serum gonadotropin levels were examined. Genotyping was performed by 
      DNA sequencing of the patients and controls. Results: The distribution of CAG and 
      GGN repeat lengths in our patients and controls was within the normal range and 
      did not significantly differ between the patients and the controls. Conclusion: 
      CAG repeat length in the AR constitutes one of multiple genetic factors relevant 
      to the development of isolated micropenis, and the expansion of this repeat can 
      be detected as a likely modifying factor. Moreover, the interactions of other 
      genes that may be involved in the etiology of isolated micropenis with CAG and 
      GGN repeats have to be taken into consideration.

TI  - Androgen Receptor CAG Repeat Length as a Risk Factor of Late-Onset Hypogonadism 
      in a Korean Male Population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Testosterone action is mediated through the androgen receptor (AR), 
      whose sensitivity is influenced by the AR CAG repeat polymorphism. However, the 
      relation between late-onset hypogonadism (LOH) and AR CAG repeat length is 
      unclear and studies of Asian populations are limited. AIM: To investigate the 
      relation between AR CAG repeat length and LOH in Korean men. METHODS: 263 Korean 
      men (mean age = 63.43 +/- 10.9 years) were enrolled from 2014 to 2015. LOH 
      diagnosis was based on a serum testosterone level lower than 3.5 ng/mL and 
      positive androgen deficiency according to the Aging Males' Symptom Scale (AMS). 
      Total testosterone levels and answers to the LOH-related questionnaire were 
      analyzed. OUTCOMES: The relation between AR CAG repeat length and LOH was 
      determined. RESULTS: Mean CAG repeat length was 22.1 +/- 4.6 and mean serum 
      testosterone levels were 2.6 +/- 0.7 and 6.0 +/- 2.0 ng/mL in men with and without 
      LOH, respectively. Men with LOH showed significantly longer AR CAG repeat lengths 
      than men without LOH (26.1 vs 21.6, P < .001). Longer CAG repeat lengths were 
      correlated with higher AMS total scores (r = 0.454, P = .001) and AMS psychotic, 
      somatic, and sexual sub-scores (r = 0.276, 0.246, and 0.571, P = .006, .007, 
      .001, respectively) and significantly lower 5-item International Index of 
      Erectile Function scores (r = -0.261, P = .001). Multivariate analysis showed 
      that patient age and CAG repeat length were independently associated with LOH 
      (odds ratio = 1.05 and 1.29, P = .041 and <.001, respectively). CLINICAL 
      IMPLICATIONS: A longer CAG repeat length is associated with LOH symptoms and LOH. 
      STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: Associations between CAG repeats and LOH were verified 
      in Korean patients. Moreover, a longer CAG repeat length was shown to be an 
      independent risk factor for LOH. Limitations included the small number of LOH 
      patients studied and that other sex hormone-associated factors were not measured. 
      CONCLUSIONS: AR CAG repeat length was associated with LOH prevalence and clinical 
      symptoms in this Korean male population. Thus, it is important to measure CAG 
      repeat length for patients with LOH symptoms with normal testosterone levels. Kim

TI  - Using Genetic and Epigenetic Markers to Improve Differential Diagnosis of 
      Prostate Cancer and Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia by Noninvasive Methods in 
      Mexican Patients.

LID - S1558-7673(18)30120-4 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common malignancy in Mexican men. 
      Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is the usual noninvasive biomarker used for 
      its detection. Its low specificity can increase the number of unnecessary 
      prostate biopsies and the incidence of unpleasant complications for patients. The 
      androgen-receptor gene (AR-CAG) repeat length and the percentage of promoter 
      methylation (PPM) of genes glutathione-S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) and Ras 
      association domain family 1 isoform A (RASSF1A) improve PCa detection. As an 
      option for noninvasive assessment, we evaluated a combined analysis of all these 
      biomarkers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 186 patients scheduled for biopsy 
      were included in the present study. PSA and AR-CAG repeats were analyzed in blood 
      samples. The PPM of GSTP1 and RASSF1A genes was estimated in prostate tissue and 
      urinary sediment cells (USCs) and plasma DNA using quantitative 
      methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. The predictive values for PCa and 
      benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), logistic regression analysis, receiver 
      operating characteristic curve, and decision curve analysis were used to assess 
      the differential diagnosis. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences 
      between PCa and BPH patients were observed for all biomarkers, with higher 
      positive and negative predictive values when all biomarkers were included in the 
      analysis, attaining USC values of 89.2% and 78.0%, respectively. The differential 
      diagnosis accuracy of PSA (area under the curve, 0.59) increased to 0.70 and 
      0.68, respectively, when the combined analysis of PPM of RASSF1A(plasma) or 
      GSTP1A(USC) and AR-CAG repeats was performed. Decision curve analysis showed the 
      utility of the combined analysis to decrease the number of unnecessary biopsies. 
      CONCLUSION: The results showed that combined analysis of the proposed biomarkers 
      in plasma and USCs significantly increased the confidence for the differential 
      diagnosis for PCa and BPH. This noninvasive practice might help in the early 
      detection of PCa and patient follow-up, avoiding to some extent unnecessary 
      prostate biopsies.

TI  - Longer trinucleotide repeats of androgen receptor are associated with higher 
      testosterone and low oxytocin levels in diabetic premature ejaculatory 
      dysfunction patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite its worldwide high occurrence, the obscurity regarding the 
      description, epidemiology and management of premature ejaculation remains 
      provocative. It is well established that male premature ejaculatory dysfunction 
      is an increasing problem due to spontaneous ejaculation across a variety of 
      general and clinical subjects. The main goal of this study was to determine the 
      relationships between trinucleotide repeats of the androgen receptor (AR), sex 
      steroids, and pituitary hormones with sexual function in men with type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus (DM) and reported with acquired premature ejaculation (PE). METHODS: A 
      total of 150 normal and 250 PE + DM subjects were enrolled in this study. Each 
      subject was invited to fill out an elaborative questionnaire to acquire precise 
      selective information regarding BMI, duration of PE + DM, self-reported 
      Intra-Vaginal Ejaculatory Latency Time (IELT), sexual and mental health status by 
      using the premature ejaculation diagnostic tool (PEDT) and Beck Depression 
      Inventory-II (BDI-II). Pearson's correlation analysis was used to analyze the 
      relationship between clinical, hormonal, and genetic variables. Ward's minimum 
      variance cluster analysis and principal component analysis were used for 
      evaluation of dependence between genetic, clinical, and demographic parameters. 
      RESULTS: The patients who have the lowest number of (</=21) (CAG)n repeats have 
      higher serum oxytocin levels (114.2 pg/ml; n = 54, 43.2%) than the controls 
      (69.18 pg/ml; n = 22, 17.6%) and the patients with the highest (>/=26) number of 
      (CAG)n repeats (62.9 pg/ml; n = 108, 43.2%).On the other hand, patients who have 
      the highest numbers of (CAG)n repeats (>/=26) have higher serum testosterone 
      (6.1 ng/ml; n = 108, 43.2% of cohort) lower prolactin (3.01 ng/ml; n = 108, 43.2% 
      of cohort) levels than the controls and patients with the lowest numbers (</=21) of 
      (CAG)n repeats and their TSH (1.53 mIU/L, P < 0.05) levels are lower than those 
      of controls. In the Pearson correlation model, self-estimated IELT demonstrated 
      significantly negative correlation with both (CAG)n and (GCC)n repeats 
      (r = - 0.16, p = 0.0001; r = - 0.19, p = 0.0001) respectively. These repeats have 
      positive correlation with PEDT (r = 0.28, p = 0.0001: r = 0.24, p = 0.0001, whole 
      model) and inversely correlated with BDI-II (r = - 0.25, p = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: 
      This study indicates that androgen receptor polymorphism modulates the endocrine 
      effect on ejaculatory reflex and depends strongly on its "cofactors". Moreover, 
      our results also confirmed an association between long tri-nucleotide repeats of 
      androgen receptor, sex steroids, pituitary, and thyroid hormones in relation to  
      acquired premature ejaculatory dysfunction in diabetic patients. However, 
      endocrine regulation of PE reflex is a complex phenomenon that requires further 
      investigation.

TI  - The metabolic and endocrine characteristics in spinal and bulbar muscular

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is caused by an abnormal 
      expansion of the CAG repeat in the androgen receptor gene. This study aimed to 
      systematically phenotype a German SBMA cohort (n = 80) based on laboratory 
      markers for neuromuscular, metabolic, and endocrine status, and thus provide a 
      basis for the selection of biomarkers for future therapeutic trials. METHODS: We 
      assessed a panel of 28 laboratory parameters. The clinical course and blood 
      biomarkers were correlated with disease duration and CAG repeat length. A subset 
      of 11 patients was evaluated with body fat MRI. RESULTS: Almost all patients 
      reported muscle weakness (99%), followed by dysphagia (77%), tremor (76%), and 
      gynecomastia (75%) as major complaints. Creatine kinase was the most consistently 
      elevated (94%) serum marker, which, however, did not relate with either the 
      disease duration or the CAG repeat length. Paresis duration and CAG repeat length 
      correlated with dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate after correction for body mass 
      index and age. The androgen insensitivity index was elevated in nearly half of 
      the participants (48%). CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic alterations in glucose homeostasis 
      (diabetes) and fat metabolism (combined hyperlipidemia), and sex hormone 
      abnormalities (androgen insensitivity) could be observed among SBMA patients 
      without association with the neuromuscular phenotype. Dehydroepiandrosterone 
      sulfate was the only biomarker that correlated strongly with both weakness 
      duration and the CAG repeat length after adjusting for age and BMI, indicating 
      its potential as a biomarker for both disease severity and duration and, 
      therefore, its possible use as a reliable outcome measure in future therapeutic 
      studies.

AB  - Autozygosity mapping (AM) is a technique utilised for mapping homozygous 
      autosomal recessive (AR) traits and facilitation of genetic diagnosis. We 
      investigated the utility of AM for the molecular diagnosis of heterogeneous AR 
      disorders, using epidermolysis bullosa (EB) as a paradigm. We applied this 
      technique to a cohort of 46 distinct EB families using both short tandem repeat 
      (STR) and genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array-based AM to 
      guide targeted Sanger sequencing of EB candidate genes. Initially, 39 of the 46 
      cases were diagnosed with homozygous mutations using this method. Independently, 
      26 cases, including the seven initially unresolved cases, were analysed with an 
      EB-targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel. NGS identified mutations in 
      five additional cases, initially undiagnosed due to the presence of compound 
      heterozygosity, deep intronic mutations or runs of homozygosity below the set 
      threshold of 2 Mb, for a total yield of 44 of 46 cases (95.7%) diagnosed 
      genetically.

TI  - Positive Correlation between Androgen Receptor CAG Repeat Length and Metabolic 
      Syndrome in a Korean Male Population.
PG  - 73-78
LID - 10.5534/wjmh.17029 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: In epidemiological studies, there are various associations of androgen 
      receptor (AR) CAG with several diseases or phenotypes. However, the relationship 
      between CAG repeat length and metabolic syndrome (MS) remains unclear, especially 
      in Asian populations. This study was designed to evaluate the relationship 
      between AR CAG repeat length polymorphism and MS in a Korean male population. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We explored the relationship between AR CAG repeat length 
      polymorphism and MS in a Korean male population (n=337) from 2013 to 2014. AR CAG 
      repeat were determined by microsatellite fragment sizing. Components of MS and 
      laboratory data (lipid profile, fasting glucose, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)) 
      were analyzed with AR CAG repeat length. RESULTS: The mean AR CAG repeat length 
      was 22.3+/-4.7. Sixty-nine men (20.5%) were diagnosed with MS. Men with MS showed 
      significantly longer AR CAG repeat lengths compared with men without MS (26.2 vs. 
      21.4, p<0.001). With increasing CAG repeat, the number of components meeting the 
      NCEP criteria increased significantly. AR CAG repeat length was associated 
      significantly with high density lipoprotein (HDL), triglyceride, and HbA1c 
      levels. In the multivariate analysis, CAG repeat length, waist circumference, and 
      levels of HDL were independently associated with MS. (odds ratio (OR)=1.37, 1.19 
      and 0.90, p<0.001, 0.045, and 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: AR CAG repeat 
      length was associated with MS and laboratory test results, such as those for HDL, 
      triglycerides, and HbA1c, in Korean males. Longer CAG repeat length was 
      identified as a risk factor for MS in Korean males.

AB  - Cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat expansions in the coding regions of nine 
      polyglutamine (polyQ) genes (HTT, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, ATN1, AR, 
      and TBP) are the cause of several neurodegenerative diseases including 
      Huntington's disease (HD), six different spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, and spinobulbar muscular atrophy. The 
      expanded CAG repeat length in the causative gene is negatively related to the 
      age-at-onset (AAO) of clinical symptoms. In addition to the expanded CAG repeat 
      length in the causative gene, the normal CAG repeats in the other polyQ genes can 
      affect the AAO, suggesting functional interactions between the polyQ genes. 
      However, there is no detailed assessment of the relationships among polyQ genes 
      in pathologically relevant brain regions. We used gene co-expression analysis to 
      study the functional relationships among polyQ genes in different brain regions 
      using the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA), a spatial map of gene expression in the 
      healthy brain. We constructed co-expression networks for seven anatomical brain 
      structures, as well as a region showing a specific pattern of atrophy in HD 
      patients detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. In this 
      HD-associated region, we found that ATN1 and ATXN2 were co-expressed and shared 
      co-expression partners which were enriched for DNA repair genes. We observed a 
      similar co-expression pattern in the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, and striatum in 
      which this relation was most pronounced. Given that the co-expression patterns 
      for these anatomical structures were similar to those for the HD-associated 
      region, our results suggest that their disruption is likely involved in HD 
      pathology. Moreover, ATN1 and ATXN2 also shared many co-expressed genes with HTT, 
      the causative gene of HD, across the brain. Although this triangular relationship 
      among these three polyQ genes may also be dysregulated in other polyQ diseases, 
      stronger co-expression patterns between ATN1 and ATXN2 observed in the 
      HD-associated region, especially in the striatum, may be more specific to HD.

TI  - Association of androgen receptor gene CAG and GGN repeat polymorphism with 
      cryptorchidism: A meta-analysis.
LID - 10.1111/and.12909 [doi]
AB  - Researches on association between variations in the androgen receptor (AR) gene 
      repeat polymorphisms and cryptorchidism (CO) had conflicting results. The aim of 
      this meta-analysis was to analyse the potential effects of AR CAG and/or GGN 
      repeat polymorphism on CO. Studies were independently appraised by two 
      investigators on PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO databases and Foreign Medical 
      Retrieval System. Case-control studies with measurement of CAG and/or GGN repeat 
      length were included. Weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals 
      (CIs) for the CAG or GGN repeat polymorphism and CO were calculated. Five reports 
      were included in this analysis. Overall, no difference was identified between 
      patients and fertile men in CAG repeat length. However, when the CO was divided 
      into unilateral and bilateral, longer CAG repeat region was significantly 
      associated with CO in bilateral group (WMD = 0.74; 95% CI, 0.01-1.47; p < .05). 
      In addition, GGN lengths were significantly higher in patients compared with 
      those in controls (WMD = 1.17; 95% CI, 0.28-2.06; p < .05). No obvious effect was 
      found in the GGN length when compared unilateral or bilateral group with control 
      respectively. The results in this meta-analysis indicated that AR CAG and GGN 
      repeat polymorphisms may be an important pathogenesis of CO.

TI  - A population-based incidence of M2 strokes indicates potential expansion of large 
      vessel occlusions amenable to endovascular therapy.
PG  - 510-515
LID - 10.1136/neurintsurg-2017-013371 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: M2 occlusions may result in poor outcomes and potentially benefit 
      from endovascular therapy. Data on the rate of M2 strokes is lacking. 
      METHODOLOGY: Patients with acute ischemic stroke discharged over a period of 
      3 years from a tertiary level hospital in the 'stroke belt' were evaluated for M2 
      occlusions on baseline vascular imaging. Regional and national incidence was 
      calculated from discharge and multicounty data. RESULTS: There were 2739 ICD-9 
      based AIS discharges. M2 occlusions in 116 (4%, 95% CI 3.5% to 5%) patients 
      constituted the second most common occlusion site. The median National Institute 
      of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 12 (IQR 5-18). Good outcomes were 
      observed in 43% (95% CI 34% to 53%), poor outcomes in 57% (95% CI 47% to 66%), 
      and death occurred in 27% (95% CI 19% to 37%) of patients. Receiver operating 
      characteristics curves showed the NIHSS to be predictive of outcomes (area under 
      the curve 0.829, 95% CI 0.745 to 0.913, p<0.0001). An NIHSS score >/=9 was the 
      optimal cut-off point for predicting poor outcomes (sensitivity 85.7%, 
      specificity 67.4%). 71 (61%) patients had an NIHSS score >/=9 and 45 (39%) an NIHSS 
      score <9. The rate of good-outcome was 22.6% for NIHSS score >/=9 versus 78.4% for 
      NIHSSscore <9 (OR=0.08, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.21, p<0.0001). Mortality was 42% for 
      NIHSS score >/=9 versus 2.7% for NIHSS score <9 (OR=26, 95% CI 3.3 to 202, 
      p<0.0001). Infarct volume was 57 (+/-55.7) cm(3) for NIHSS score >/=9 versus 
      30 (+/-34)cm(3) for NIHSS score <9 (p=0.003). IV recombinant tissue plasminogen 
      activator (rtPA) administered in 28 (24%) patients did not affect outcomes. The 
      rate of M2 occlusions was 7 (95% CI 5 to 9)/100 000 people/year (3%, 95% CI 2% to 
      4%), giving an incidence of 21 176 (95% CI 15 282 to 29 247)/year. Combined with 
      M1, internal carotid artery terminus and basilar artery, this yields a 'large 
      vessel occlusion (LVO)+M2' rate of 31 (95% CI 26 to 35)/100 000 people/year and a 
      national incidence of 99 227 (95% CI 84 004 to 112 005) LVO+M2 strokes/year. 
      CONCLUSION: M2 occlusions can present with serious neurological deficits and 
      cause significant morbidity and mortality. Patients with M2 occlusions and higher 
      baseline deficits (NIHSS score >/=9) may benefit from endovascular therapy, thus 
      potentially expanding the category of acute ischemic strokes amenable to 
      intervention.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between the androgen receptor 
      (AR) cytosine, adenine, and guanine (CAG) repeat polymorphisms and endometriosis. 
      STUDY DESIGN: A prospective case-control, genetic association study was performed 
      on women with surgically proven endometriosis (n=421) and controls free of 
      endometriosis (n=349). AR CAG repeat lengths were determined from peripheral 
      blood samples. The difference in the frequency of each alleles were compared in 
      patients with endometriosis and controls using Chi-square test. MAIN RESULTS: No 
      significant difference in biallelic length mean between patients and controls was 
      observed. Alleles containing 24 CAG repeats were significantly more frequent in 
      stage I-II (mild) endometriosis than in the control samples (19.8% and 13.3%, 
      respectively; OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.04-2.47). Additionally, a higher frequency of 
      both alleles with 24 or more CAG repeats was observed in individuals with mild 
      endometriosis, in comparison with the controls (25.6% and 15.2%, respectively; OR 
      1.92, 95% CI 1.09-3.38). CONCLUSIONS: AR gene CAG repeat polymorphisms are 
      associated with the increased risk of mild endometriosis.

TI  - Long-term treatment with leuprorelin for spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy: 
      natural history-controlled study.
PG  - 1026-1032
LID - 10.1136/jnnp-2017-316015 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prognosis and progression of spinal and bulbar 
      muscular atrophy (SBMA), a rare X-linked motor neuron disorder caused by 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion in the AR (androgen receptor) gene, after 
      long-term androgen suppression with leuprorelin acetate treatment. METHODS: In 
      the present natural history-controlled study, 36 patients with SBMA treated with 
      leuprorelin acetate for up to 84 months (leuprorelin acetate-treated group; LT 
      group) and 29 patients with SBMA with no specific treatment (non-treated group; 
      NT group) were analysed. Disease progression was evaluated by longitudinal 
      quantitative assessment of motor functioning using the revised Amyotrophic 
      Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R), and the modified Norris 
      score. In addition, we selected two major clinical endpoint events, namely the 
      occurrence of pneumonia requiring hospitalisation and death, to evaluate disease 
      prognosis following long-term leuprorelin acetate treatment. RESULTS: In our 
      analysis of the longitudinal disease progression using the random slope model, we 
      observed a significant difference in the ALSFRS-R total score, the Limb Norris 
      Score, and the Norris Bulbar Score (p=0.005, 0.026 and 0.020, respectively), with 
      the LT group exhibiting a slower per-12-months decline compared with the NT 
      group. As for the event analysis, the prognosis of the LT group was better in 
      comparison to the NT group as for the event-free survival period (p=0.021). 
      CONCLUSION: Long-term treatment with leuprorelin acetate appears to delay the 
      functional decline and suppress the incidence of pneumonia and death in subjects 
      with SBMA.

TI  - Large normal-range TBP and ATXN7 CAG repeat lengths are associated with increased 
      lifetime risk of depression.

AB  - Depression is one of the most prevalent and debilitating psychiatric disorders 
      worldwide. Recently, we showed that both relatively short and relatively long 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeats in the huntingtin gene (HTT) are 
      associated with an increased risk of lifetime depression. However, to what extent 
      the variations in CAG repeat length in the other eight polyglutamine 
      disease-associated genes (PDAGs) are associated with depression is still unknown. 
      We determined the CAG repeat sizes of ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, 
      ATN1 and AR in two well-characterized Dutch cohorts-the Netherlands Study of 
      Depression and Anxiety and the Netherlands Study of Depression in Older 
      Persons-including 2165 depressed and 1058 non-depressed individuals-aged 18-93 
      years. The association between PDAG CAG repeat size and the risk for depression 
      was assessed via binary logistic regression. We found that the odds ratio (OR) 
      for lifetime depression was significantly higher for individuals with >10, 
      compared with subjects with </=10, CAG repeats in both ATXN7 alleles (OR=1.90, 
      confidence interval (CI) 1.26-2.85). For TBP we found a similar association: A 
      CAG repeat length exceeding the median in both alleles was associated with an 
      increased risk for lifetime depression (OR=1.33, CI 1.00-1.76). In conclusion, we 
      observed that carriers of either ATXN7 or TBP alleles with relatively large CAG 
      repeat sizes in both alleles had a substantially increased risk of lifetime 
      depression. Our findings provide critical evidence for the notion that repeat 
      polymorphisms can act as complex genetic modifiers of depression.

AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), also known as Kennedy's disease, is a 
      motor neuron disease caused by the expansion of a polymorphic CAG tandem repeat 
      encoding a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the androgen receptor (AR) gene. SBMA 
      is triggered by the binding of mutant AR to its natural ligands, testosterone and 
      dihydrotestosterone (DHT). To investigate the neuronal alterations of motor 
      neuron cell models of SBMA, we applied patch-clamp methods to verify how polyQ 
      expansions in the AR alter cell ionic currents. We used mouse motoneuron-derived 
      MN-1 cells expressing normal AR (MN24Q) and mutant AR (MN100Q treated cells with 
      vehicle EtOH and DHT). We observed a reduction of the current flux mainly at 
      depolarizing potentials in the DHT-treated cells, while the dissection of 
      macroscopic currents showed single different cationic currents belonging to 
      voltage-gated channels. Also, we treated the cells with IGF-1 and PACAP, which 
      have previously been shown to protect MN-1 cells from the toxicity of mutant AR, 
      and we found an amelioration of the altered currents. Our results suggest that 
      the electrophysiological correlate of SBMA is a suitable reference point for the 
      identification of disease symptoms and for future therapeutic targets.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to identify cephalometric pretreatment 
      parameters for prediction of Class II improvement induced by rapid maxillary 
      expansion. METHODS: Lateral cephalograms of 30 patients (mean age 8.3 +/- 1.6 years 
      old) showing Class II molar relationship and undergone to rapid maxillary 
      expansion on the upper deciduous molars were traced before treatment, and molar 
      relation changes were evaluated on dental casts before and after treatment. 
      Overall treatment time lasted 10.2 +/- 2 months. Good responders (18 subjects, 10 
      females and 8 males) showed improvement of at least 2.50 mm, and bad responders 
      (12 subjects, 7 females and 5 males) showed no improvement, improvement less than 
      2.50 mm, or worsening of molar relationship after treatment. Student's t test was 
      used to assess significance of differences between groups, and discriminant 
      analysis allowed identification of predictive pretreatment variables. RESULTS: 
      Articular angle, superior gonial angle, and mandibular dimensions (Co-Gn, S-Ar, 
      Ar-Go, Go-Me) showed significant differences in the comparison between groups. 
      Mandibular length Co-Gn and superior gonial angle were selected as significant 
      predictive variable for discrimination. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with smaller 
      mandibular length and more acute superior gonial angle are expected to have more 
      chances to improve molar Class II after rapid maxillary expansion.

TI  - The polymorphic CAG repeat in exon 1 of androgen receptor is associated with 
      level of HDL cholesterol and hypertension in Chinese middle-aged and elderly men.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The length of the CAG repeats in exon 1 of the androgen receptor (AR) 
      gene has been shown to be inversely correlated with AR transcriptional activity. 
      This study aimed to investigate the correlations between the length of CAG repeat 
      in AR and serum lipids and hypertension in Chinese men. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: The 
      relationship between length of the CAG repeat in exon 1 of AR with prevalence of 
      hypertension and the levels of serum lipids among Chinese men (aged >/=40 years). 
      MEASUREMENTS: The physical condition of the subjects was examined and recorded. 
      The concentrations of blood lipids and sex hormones were measured, and the CAG 
      repeat lengths of the AR gene were determined. RESULTS: The length of the AR CAG 
      repeats was associated with HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) concentration, and the 
      stepwise multiple regression model showed that this association was independent 
      of body mass index (BMI), triglycerides (TG) and total cholesterol (TC), although 
      these factors influence HDL-C concentration. Furthermore, men with <22 vs men 
      with >/=22 CAG repeats showed higher blood pressure and higher prevalence of 
      hypertension. Shorter CAG repeat numbers were associated with the increased risk 
      of hypertension in a multivariate logistic regression analysis (odds 
      ratio = 0.715; 95% confidence interval, 0.517-0.989; P = 0.043). No significant 
      correlation of AR CAG repeat polymorphism with sex hormone levels, TG, LDL 
      cholesterol (LDL-C) or TC was found. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence 
      that men carrying shorter (<22) AR CAG repeats have lower HDL-C level and 
      increased risk of hypertension. The androgenic activity may differ due to the 
      polymorphic length of CAG repeats of the AR gene.

TI  - Androgen receptor gene CAG and GGN repeat lengths as predictors of recovery of 
      spermatogenesis following testicular germ cell cancer treatment.
PG  - 538-542
LID - 10.4103/1008-682X.191126 [doi]
AB  - Spermatogenesis is an androgen-regulated process that depends on the action of 
      androgen receptor (AR). Sperm production may be affected in men treated for 
      testicular cancer (TC), and it is important to identify the factors influencing 
      the timing of spermatogenesis recovery following cancer treatment. It is known 
      that the CAG and GGN repeat numbers affect the activity of the AR; therefore, the 
      aim of this study is to investigate if the CAG and GGN polymorphisms in the AR 
      gene predict recovery of sperm production after TC treatment. TC patients (n = 
      130) delivered ejaculates at the following time points: postorchiectomy and at 6, 
      12, 24, 36, and 60 months posttherapy (T0, T6, T12, T24, T36, and T60). The CAG 
      lengths were categorized into three groups, <22 CAG, 22-23 CAG, and >23 CAG, and 
      the GGN tracts were also categorized into three groups, <23 GGN, 23 GGN, and >23 
      GGN. At T12, men with 22-23 CAG presented with a statistically significantly (P = 
      0.045) lower sperm concentration than those with other CAG numbers (8.4 x 106 
      ml-1 vs 16 x 106 ml-1 ; 95% CI: 1.01-2.65). This association was robust to 
      omitting adjustment for treatment type and sperm concentration at T0 (P = 0.021; 
      3.7 x 106 ml-1 vs 10 x 106 ml-1 ; 95% CI: 1.13-4.90). The same trends were 
      observed for total sperm number. The least active AR variant seems to be 
      associated with a more rapid recovery of spermatogenesis. This finding adds to 
      our understanding of the biology of postcancer therapy recovery of fertility in 
      males and has clinical implications.

TI  - Combined effect of polymorphisms in type III 5-alpha reductase and androgen receptor 
      gene with the risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia in Korea.
PG  - 504-508
AB  - We evaluated whether type III 5-alpha reductase (SRD5A3; steroid reductase 
      5-alpha 3) polymorphism was associated with susceptibility of benign prostate 
      hyperplasia (BPH) and the combined effects in BPH risk between the type of short 
      tandem repeat (STR) in SRD5A3 and the length of trinucleotide (CAG) repeats in 
      androgen receptor (AR) gene. We compared the length of AC repeats in STR region 
      of SRD5A3 gene and a CAG repeat in AR in 188 BPH patients who underwent 
      transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) and 98 controls by polymerase chain 
      reaction-based methods. We defined short type was less than 21 copies of AC 
      repeats. The odds ratio for BPH between the men with at least one of short type 
      and with both large types of STR in SRD5A3 gene was 3.10 (95% confidence interval 
      [CI], 1.87-5.16; P=0.000). And BPH was 2.35 times more likely to occur in with 
      less than 23 copies of CAG repeats than men equal or greater than 23 copies in AR 
      gene (95% CI, 1.18-2.36; P=0.016). The men with the large type of STR and >/=23 
      copies of CAG repeats have 5.3 times BPH risk compared to the reference group 
      with the at least one of the short type of STR and <23 copies (P<0.000). In 
      conclusion, these results suggest that shorter AC repeats of SRD5A3 gene and 
      shorter CAG repeats of AR gene were associated with an increased risk for BPH. 
      However, the interaction between above two factors was not affected in risk of 
      BPH.

TI  - Cell cycle-coupled expansion of AR activity promotes cancer progression.
PG  - 1655-1668
LID - 10.1038/onc.2016.334 [doi]
AB  - The androgen receptor (AR) is required for prostate cancer (PCa) survival and 
      progression, and ablation of AR activity is the first line of therapeutic 
      intervention for disseminated disease. While initially effective, recurrent 
      tumors ultimately arise for which there is no durable cure. Despite the 
      dependence of PCa on AR activity throughout the course of disease, delineation of 
      the AR-dependent transcriptional network that governs disease progression remains 
      elusive, and the function of AR in mitotically active cells is not well 
      understood. Analyzing AR activity as a function of cell cycle revealed an 
      unexpected and highly expanded repertoire of AR-regulated gene networks in 
      actively cycling cells. New AR functions segregated into two major clusters: 
      those that are specific to cycling cells and retained throughout the mitotic cell 
      cycle ('Cell Cycle Common'), versus those that were specifically enriched in a 
      subset of cell cycle phases ('Phase Restricted'). Further analyses identified 
      previously unrecognized AR functions in major pathways associated with clinical 
      PCa progression. Illustrating the impact of these unmasked AR-driven pathways, 
      dihydroceramide desaturase 1 was identified as an AR-regulated gene in 
      mitotically active cells that promoted pro-metastatic phenotypes, and in advanced 
      PCa proved to be highly associated with development of metastases, recurrence 
      after therapeutic intervention and reduced overall survival. Taken together, 
      these findings delineate AR function in mitotically active tumor cells, thus 
      providing critical insight into the molecular basis by which AR promotes 
      development of lethal PCa and nominate new avenues for therapeutic intervention.

TI  - The androgen receptor gene CAG repeat ...in relation to 4-year changes in 
      ...androgen-sensitive endpoints in ...community-dwelling older European men.
PG  - 583-593
AB  - CONTEXT: The androgen receptor (AR) gene exon 1 CAG repeat length has been 
      proposed to be a determinant of between-individual variations in androgen action 
      in target tissues, which might regulate phenotypic differences of human ageing. 
      However, findings on its phenotypic effects are inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: To 
      assess whether the AR CAG repeat length is associated with longitudinal changes 
      in endpoints that are influenced by testosterone (T) levels in middle-aged and 
      elderly European men. DESIGN: Multinational European observational prospective 
      cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1887 men (mean +/- s.d. age: 63 +/- 11 years; 
      median follow up: 4.3 years) from centres of eight European countries comprised 
      the analysis sample after exclusion of those with diagnosed diseases of the 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) axis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Longitudinal 
      associations between the AR CAG repeat and changes in androgen-sensitive 
      endpoints (ASEs) and medical conditions were assessed using regression analysis 
      adjusting for age and centre. The AR CAG repeat length was treated as both a 
      continuous and a categorical (6-20; 21-23; 24-39 repeats) predictor. Additional 
      analysis investigated whether results were independent of baseline T or 
      oestradiol (E(2)) levels. RESULTS: The AR CAG repeat, when used as a continuous 
      or a categorical predictor, was not associated with longitudinal changes in ASEs 
      or medical conditions after adjustments. These results were independent of T and 
      E(2) levels. CONCLUSION: Within a 4-year time frame, variations in the AR CAG 
      repeat do not contribute to the rate of phenotypic ageing, over and above, which 
      might be associated with the age-related decline in T levels.

TI  - Non-Cell-Autonomous Regulation of Retrograde Motoneuronal Axonal Transport in an 
      SBMA Mouse Model.
LID - 10.1523/ENEURO.0062-16.2016 [doi]
LID - ENEURO.0062-16.2016
AB  - Defects in axonal transport are seen in motoneuronal diseases, but how that 
      impairment comes about is not well understood. In spinal bulbar muscular atrophy 
      (SBMA), a disorder linked to a CAG/polyglutamine repeat expansion in the androgen 
      receptor (AR) gene, the disease-causing AR disrupts axonal transport by acting in 
      both a cell-autonomous fashion in the motoneurons themselves, and in a 
      non-cell-autonomous fashion in muscle. The non-cell-autonomous mechanism is 
      suggested by data from a unique "myogenic" transgenic (TG) mouse model in which 
      an AR transgene expressed exclusively in skeletal muscle fibers triggers an 
      androgen-dependent SBMA phenotype, including defects in retrograde transport. 
      However, motoneurons in this TG model retain the endogenous AR gene, leaving open 
      the possibility that impairments in transport in this model also depend on ARs in 
      the motoneurons themselves. To test whether non-cell-autonomous mechanisms alone 
      can perturb retrograde transport, we generated male TG mice in which the 
      endogenous AR allele has the testicular feminization mutation (Tfm) and, 
      consequently, is nonfunctional. Males carrying the Tfm allele alone show no 
      deficits in motor function or axonal transport, with or without testosterone 
      treatment. However, when Tfm males carrying the myogenic transgene (Tfm/TG) are 
      treated with testosterone, they develop impaired motor function and defects in 
      retrograde transport, having fewer retrogradely labeled motoneurons and deficits 
      in endosomal flux based on time-lapse video microscopy of living axons. These 
      findings demonstrate that non-cell-autonomous disease mechanisms originating in 
      muscle are sufficient to induce defects in retrograde transport in motoneurons.

TI  - Androgen receptor GGC repeat might be more involved than CAG repeat in the 
      regulation of the metabolic profile in men.
PG  - 1067-1075
AB  - The influence of androgen receptor (AR) GGC repeat polymorphism on the metabolic 
      profile of men has been much less studied than the one of CAG tract polymorphism. 
      Therefore, in this study, we looked for the association of GGC and CAG tract with 
      cardiovascular risk factors in men. Ninety-eight men followed by our andrological 
      unit were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical and biochemical parameters on 
      cardiovascular risk were considered. AR CAG and GGC polymorphisms were studied. 
      GGC triplets were found to be positively and significantly correlated with 
      several cardiovascular risk factors. On the other hand, inverse and significant 
      correlations of CAG triplets were found with insulin and HOMA. As expected, age 
      was positively correlated with cardiovascular risk, whereas total testosterone 
      was inversely correlated with metabolic profile. Estradiol was not found to be 
      correlated with any of the metabolic parameters. In the total sample, 
      multivariate linear regression analysis confirms the positive and independent 
      association of GGC triplets with glycemia, glycated hemoglobin, total 
      cholesterol, triglycerides and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance 
      (HOMA), whereas CAG repeat length is negatively associated with insulin and HOMA. 
      Such associations are also substantially confirmed in non-diabetic subjects, 
      whereas in diabetic patients only the GGC tract seems to be involved in the 
      metabolic profile regulation. Our work shows a relevant role for GGC repeat tract 
      in conditioning male cardiovascular risk, thus rendering necessary a deeper 
      analysis on the role of GGC polymorphism both from the molecular and the clinical 
      point of view.

TI  - Androgen receptor CAG polymorphism and sporadic and early-onset prostate cancer 
      among Mexican men.
PG  - 781-6
LID - 10.1038/jhg.2016.49 [doi]
AB  - A short CAG repeat length in the gene encoding for the androgen receptor (AR) has 
      been associated with prostate cancer (PC) risk and aggressiveness. In Latino men, 
      information on this association is scarce. Hence, the aim of this study was to 
      evaluate this association in Mexican males. Using fragment analysis by capillary 
      electrophoresis, we determined the number of CAG repeats-(CAG)n-in AR gene from 
      158 incident PC cases and 326 age-matched healthy controls (+/-5 years), residing 
      in Mexico City, Mexico. According to Gleason scale and age at diagnosis, cases 
      were classified as high (...7) and low grade (<7), as well as early onset (<60 
      years) or late onset PC (...60 years). At diagnosis, 78% of cases were classified 
      as high-grade and 26.6% as early onset. Men with sporadic (no family history of 
      PC) and early-onset PC presented shorter CAG repeat length than controls 
      (18.6+/-2.2 vs 19.5+/-2.5; P=0.02). Lower number of CAG repeats (CAG)...19 were 
      associated with a greater risk for early-onset PC (odds ratio: 2.31; 95% 
      confidence interval: 1.14-4.69). CAG repeat length could increase the risk for 
      sporadic and early-onset PC. The best cutoff point for identifying at-risk 
      subjects was (CAG)19. However, further studies are necessary to replicate our 
      findings in subjects with a family history of PC and also to evaluate the 
      association between CAG repeats length and disease progression.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to describe a case series of 4 sisters 
      with discordant clinical phenotypes associated with fragile X-associated 
      tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) that may be explained by varying CGG repeat sizes 
      and activation ratios (ARs) (the ratio of cells carrying the normal fragile X 
      mental retardation 1 [FMR1] allele on the active X chromosome). METHODS: Four 
      sisters with premutation size FMR1 gene repeats underwent detailed clinical 
      characterization. CGG repeat length was determined by PCR, and AR was determined 
      using a newly developed commercial methylation PCR assay and was compared with 
      the results from Southern blot with densitometric image analysis. RESULTS: Sister 
      1 had the largest CGG expansion (82) and the lowest AR (12%), with the most 
      severe clinical presentation. Sister 2 had a lower CGG expansion (70) and an AR 
      of 10% but had a milder clinical presentation.Sister 3 had a similar CGG 
      expansion (79) but a slightly higher AR of 15% and less neurologic involvement. 
      Sister 4 had a similar CGG expansion size of 80 but had the largest AR (40%) and 
      was the only sister not to be affected by FXTAS or have any neurologic signs on 
      examination. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that premutation carrier women 
      who have higher ARs may be less likely to show manifestations of FXTAS. If larger 
      studies show similar patterns, AR data could potentially be beneficial to 
      supplement CGG repeat size when counseling premutation carrier women in the 
      clinic.

AB  - The association between polymorphism of androgen receptor gene CAG (AR-CAG) and 
      male infertility in several studies was controversial. Based on studies on 
      association between AR-CAG repeat length and male infertility in recent years, an 
      updated meta-analysis is needed. We aimed to evaluate the association between 
      AR-CAG repeat length and male infertility in advantage of the data in all 
      published reports.We searched for reports published before August 2015 using 
      PubMed, CNKI, VIP, and WanFang. Data on sample size, mean, and standard deviation 
      (SD) of AR-CAG repeat length were extracted independently by 3 
      investigators.Forty-four reports were selected based on criteria. The overall 
      infertile patients and azoospermic patients were found to have longer AR-CAG 
      repeat length (standard mean difference (SMD) = 0.19, 95% confidence interval 
      (CI): 0.10-0.28, P < 0.01; SMD = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.10-0.61, P < 0.01). AR-CAG 
      repeat length was longer in infertile men in Asian, Caucasian, and mixed races 
      (SMD = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.08-0.43, P <0.01; SMD = 0.13, 95% CI: 0.02-0.25, P <0.05; 
      SMD = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.15-0.63, P <0.01). The overall study shows that increased 
      AR-CAG repeat length was associated with male infertility. The subgroup study on 
      races shows that increased AR-CAG repeat length was associated with male 
      infertility in Asian, Caucasian, and mixed races. Increased AR-CAG repeat length 
      was also associated with azoospermia.This meta-analysis supports that increased 
      androgen receptor CAG length is capable of causing male infertility 
      susceptibility.

TI  - Hypospadias as a novel feature in spinal bulbar muscle atrophy.
PG  - 703-6
LID - 10.1007/s00415-016-8038-y [doi]
AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscle atrophy (SBMA) is an X-linked neuromuscular disorder 
      caused by CAG repeat expansions in the androgen receptor (AR) gene. The SBMA 
      phenotype consists of slowly progressive neuromuscular symptoms and 
      undermasculinization features as the result of malfunction of the AR. The latter 
      mainly includes gynecomastia and infertility. Hypospadias is also a feature of 
      undermasculinization with an underdeveloped urethra and penis; it has not been 
      described as part of the SBMA phenotype but has been suggested to be associated 
      with a prolonged CAG repeat in the AR gene. This study includes the first 
      epidemiologic description of the co-occurrence of hypospadias and SBMA in 
      subjects and their male relatives in Swedish population-based health registers, 
      as well as an additional clinical case. One boy with severe hypospadias was 
      screened for mutations in the AR gene and was found to have 42 CAG repeats in it, 
      which is in the full range of mutations causing SBMA later in life. We also 
      detected a maximum of four cases displaying the combination of SBMA and 
      hypospadias in our national register databases. This is the third case report 
      with hypospadias in association with CAG repeat expansions in the AR gene in the 
      full range known to cause SBMA later in life. Our findings suggest that 
      hypospadias may be an under diagnosed feature of the SBMA phenotype and we 
      propose that neurologists working with SBMA further investigate and report the 
      true prevalence of hypospadias among patients with SBMA.

TI  - Clonality assessment of adenomatoid tumor supports its neoplastic nature.

AB  - Adenomatoid tumor is a relatively rare disease that predominantly involves male 
      and female internal genital tracts. Although its clinical and pathologic features 
      are well characterized, there is still controversy regarding its nature as a true 
      neoplasm or a variant of mesothelial hyperplasia of a reactive nature. We sought 
      to resolve this debate by investigating the clonality of uterine adenomatoid 
      tumor from 13 female cases. The mesothelial cells and surrounding normal 
      myometrium were precisely harvested using laser capture microdissection, and 
      genomic DNA was extracted for clonal analysis by assessing the patterns of 
      X-chromosome inactivation. Fluorescent polymerase chain reaction amplification of 
      a highly polymorphic short tandem repeat of the human androgen receptor (HUMARA) 
      gene with and without methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease HpaII 
      digestion was performed on DNA extracted from mesothelial cells, using normal 
      myometrium and male blood sample as controls. Of the 13 cases successfully 
      amplified, all 10 informative cases showed concordant nonrandom X-chromosome 
      inactivation pattern consistent with monoclonality. In comparison, surrounding 
      normal myometrium showed a polyclonal pattern of X-chromosome inactivation, and 
      male blood sample failed to be amplified after HpaII treatment. Our results 
      demonstrate that adenomatoid tumor is a monoclonal disease favoring a neoplastic 
      process. This neoplastic rather than reactive nature probably accounts for its 
      frequently observed infiltrative growth pattern and the occurrence of diffuse 
      adenomatoid tumor, especially when host immunity is compromised. Additional 
      studies with larger sample sizes will be needed to conclusively prove our 
      conclusion.

AB  - We have recently described a severe haemophilia A and moyamoya (SHAM) syndrome 
      caused by Xq28 deletions encompassing F8 and the BRCC3 familial moyamoya gene. 
      The phenotype includes haemophilia A, moyamoya angiopathy, dysmorphia and 
      hypertension. The genetic analysis of the family of our SHAM patient demonstrated 
      carrier state in proband's mother and sister. The patient's mother is apparently 
      well, whereas his currently 18-years-old sister presents with mild haemophilia A, 
      coarctation of the aorta, hypertension, and ventricular arrhythmia. We performed 
      X chromosome inactivation assay based on HpaII methylation analysis of a 
      polymorphic short tandem repeat (STR) in the X linked AR (androgen receptor) gene 
      and used quantitative real-time RT PCR to measure the expression of genes from 
      the deleted region in proband's family members. We found an extremely skewed X 
      chromosome inactivation pattern in the female members of the family leading to 
      preferential inactivation of the X chromosome without Xq28 deletion in patient's 
      sister. We demonstrated differential expression of the genes from the deleted 
      region in four members of the family, that tightly correlates with the clinical 
      features. In conclusion, we show that the haematologic and cardiovascular 
      morbidity and the discrepancy between patient's sister and mother despite the 
      same genetic lesion are due to skewed X chromosome inactivation leading to 
      clinically relevant differential expression of SHAM syndrome genes. This report 
      highlights the role for BRCC3 in cardiovascular physiology and disease, and 
      demonstrates that in some complex hereditary syndromes full diagnostics may 
      require the examination of both genetic and epigenetic events.

TI  - Androgen receptor CAG repeat length and estrogen receptor status in 
      postmenopausal breast cancer prognosis.

AB  - PURPOSE: The influence of the androgen receptor (AR) CAG repeat polymorphism on 
      breast cancer is controversial. We investigated the combined effects of CAG 
      repeat length and estrogen receptor (ER) status on prognosis in 355 
      postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer. METHODS: CAG repeat length was 
      determined by the HUMARA test. Relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival 
      (OS) according to the X-weighted CAG repeat biallelic mean (XWBM) were 
      investigated by univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: XWBM was not 
      associated with RFS or OS, but a significant interaction between XWBM and ER 
      status (p = 0.002) was found for OS. ER-negative patients with median XWBM &lt;20 
      showed lower OS than ER-negative/XWBM >/=20 patients (HR = 0.270; 95% Cl: 
      0.073-0.999). ER-negative/XWBM &lt;20 patients also had significantly lower OS 
      than ER-positive women, irrespective of CAG repeat length (p&lt;0.001). 
      Accordingly, estimated OS was lowest in ER-negative patients with XWBM &lt;20 
      (OS: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.41-0.79) and highest in ER-positive patients with XWBM 
      &lt;20 (OS: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.90-0.97). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that short 
      CAG repeat length is associated with increased risk of death in ER-negative 
      disease but is related to better survival when ER is expressed. These findings 
      are in agreement with the hypothesis that AR may stimulate or inhibit breast 
      cancer growth depending on ER status, AR transactivation, and the 
      endocrine-metabolic environment of breast tumors. Evaluation of CAG repeat length 
      together with ER status could help improve the estimation of the risk of death, 
      with possible implications for the optimization of standard breast cancer 
      treatment and implementation of prevention strategies.

AB  - One characteristic of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is hyperandrogenism, which 
      may be related to the activity of androgen receptor (AR). This study was designed 
      to investigate the polymorphism of CAG and GGN repeats in the AR gene in women 
      with PCOS. The frequency distributions of CAG and GGN repeat alleles, as well as 
      their X-inactivation patterns, were compared between 76 age-matched normal women 
      (control group) and 80 women with PCOS (PCOS group). The expression of AR mRNA in 
      the ovarian tissues of seven patients with PCOS and five normal women was also 
      tested using real-time quantitative PCR. It was found that PCOS patients had 
      significantly higher frequency of longer GGN biallelic mean (29.8%) and 
      X-weighted biallelic mean (33.3%) than controls (6.1% and 3.2%, respectively, P = 
      0.002, P = 0.003). The odds ratio of the long GGN repeat length (n > 16) before 
      and after X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) in the PCOS group was significantly 
      higher than in controls (P = 0.0001, P = 0.005). AR-GGN repeat mRNA expression 
      was higher in the ovarian tissue of controls compared with PCOS patients (P = 
      0.022). In conclusion, the data suggest that the GGN repeat polymorphism in the 
      AR gene is associated with PCOS.

TI  - Characterization of a novel metastatic prostate cancer cell line of LNCaP origin.
PG  - 215-25
LID - 10.1002/pros.23115 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The LNCaP cell line was originally isolated from the lymph node of a 
      patient with metastatic prostate cancer. Many cell lines have been derived from 
      LNCaP by selective pressures to study different aspects of prostate cancer 
      progression. When injected subcutaneously into male athymic nude mice, LNCaP and 
      its derivatives rarely metastasize. METHODS: Here, we describe the 
      characteristics of a new LNCaP derivative, JHU-LNCaP-SM, which was generated by 
      long term passage in normal cell culture conditions. RESULTS: Short tandem repeat 
      (STR) analysis and genomic sequencing verified JHU-LNCaP-SM derivation from 
      parental LNCaP cells. JHU-LNCaP-SM cells express the same mutated androgen 
      receptor (AR) but unlike LNCaP, are no longer androgen dependent for growth. The 
      cells demonstrate an attenuated androgen responsiveness in transcriptional assays 
      and retain androgen sensitive expression of PSA, AR, and PSMA. Unlike parental 
      LNCaP, JHU-LNCaP-SM cells quickly form subcutaneous tumors in male athymic nude 
      mice, reliably metastasize to the lymph nodes and display a striking 
      intra-tumoral and spreading hemorrhagic phenotype as tumor xenografts. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The JHU-LNCaP-SM cell line is a new isolate of LNCaP, which 
      facilitates practical, preclinical studies of spontaneous metastasis of prostate 
      cancer through lymphatic tissues.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Biological and epidemiologic evidence suggested that androgen and its 
      receptor may play an important role in ovarian carcinogenesis. However, results 
      of previous association studies about ovarian cancer and AR CAG repeat 
      polymorphism were inconsistent. Furthermore, none of these studies were conducted 
      in Asians. METHODS: We evaluated the relationship between AR CAG repeat length 
      and epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) risk among a Chinese population including 
      1800 pathologically confirmed EOC patients and 1800 frequency matched controls. 
      RESULTS: Women with longer AR CAG repeats had a decreased EOC risk (OR=0.87 for 
      per CAG_A increase, 95% CI: 0.81-0.95). Compared to those with shorter (<22) 
      CAG_A repeat length, women with of longer (>/=22) CAG_A repeats had a 34% decreased 
      EOC risk (OR=0.66, 95% CI: 0.57-0.75). For CAG_S and CAG_L, the results remained 
      consistent. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that androgen signaling contributes 
      to the development of ovarian cancer.

TI  - The polymorphism of CAG repeats in the androgen receptor gene and breast cancer 
      mortality.
PG  - 815-22
LID - 10.3233/CBM-150525 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The polymorphic CAG repeats of the androgen receptor (AR) gene have 
      been suggested to affect the risk of breast cancer, but the results are 
      controversial. In addition, the relationship between patients' CAG genotype and 
      the prognosis has not been investigated. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is 
      to access the association between the polymorphic CAG repeats and the incidence 
      and prognosis of breast cancer. METHODS: One hundred and fifty-six breast cancer 
      cases and 108 healthy controls from Taipei Veteran General Hospital were 
      enrolled. The length of CAG repeats was analyzed among by means of PCR 
      amplification. The logistic regression model was used for cross-sectional 
      analyses of prevalent breast cancer.Furthermore, we categorized the cases 
      according to the average length of both CAG alleles (CAGn >/= 23 versus < 23). 
      Outcomes were disease-free survival and mortality. The Cox proportional hazards 
      model and Kaplan-Meier estimate were used for survival analysis. RESULTS: The 
      median age was 56 (51-64) and 46 (37-52) in breast cancer patients and healthy 
      controls, respectively. The median of CAGn was 22.5 (21.5-24) in study group and 
      23 (21.5-24) in controls. Our study showed the length of CAG repeats did not 
      contribute to breast cancer or benign breast tumors (HR 1.01; 95% CI, 0.90-1.13). 
      In the median follow-up of 6.59 years, we found the CAGn >/= 23 (n = 75) could be a 
      poor prognosis (adjust HR, 3.08; 95% CI, 1.42-6.67, p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: The 
      CAG polymorphism is not associated with development of breast cancer, but 
      patients with more CAG repeats of the AR gene are prone to poor prognoses.

TI  - Molecular analysis of ovarian mucinous carcinoma reveals different cell of 
      origins.
PG  - 22949-58
AB  - It is believed that a subset of primary ovarian mucinous tumors is derived from 
      mature teratomas [1-5]. To confirm this, we performed microsatellite genotyping 
      using a variety of short tandem repeat makers and analyzed allelotypes of 8 
      mucinous tumors (4 mucinous carcinomas, 3 atypical proliferative mucinous tumors 
      and 1 mucinous cystadenoma) associated with a teratoma to determine whether they 
      were clonally related. 7 of the 8 mucinous tumors showed complete or a high 
      degree of homozygosity. Among the 6 pairs of tumors with teratoma tissue 
      available for comparison, 5 of 6 showed a high or complete degree of allelotypes 
      matching, which differed from the somatic allelotypes of the normal control 
      tissue. A discrepancy was detected between carcinoma and teratoma in one pair at 
      several loci, with different X-chromosome inactivation patterns revealed by the 
      HUMARA clonality assay. We also investigated the allelotypes of 16 ovarian 
      mucinous carcinomas without a teratoma in young patients (range 13-30) and in 6 
      older patients (range 40-67) using the same method. None of these tumors showed 
      pure homozygosity. The number of homozygous loci in this cohort was significantly 
      lower than that in the first. Our results suggest first, that most mucinous 
      tumors associated with a teratoma are derived from the teratoma but occasionally 
      they could be collision tumors and second that the majority of pure mucinous 
      tumors in young women in whom a teratoma is not present are not derived from a 
      teratoma.

AB  - The androgen receptor (AR) is involved in the differentiation and growth of 
      breast cancer. Genetic markers in the AR gene have a plausible role in modulating 
      the risk of breast cancer. In this study, we studied the association of breast 
      cancer and the trinucleotide repeat polymorphism (CAG)n in exon 1 of the AR gene 
      in 202 patients with breast cancer and 183 healthy controls from our hospital 
      (Yinchuan, China). Repeat lengths were determined by fluorescent DNA fragment 
      analysis using the ABI GeneScan software and DNA sequencing. We detected 17 short 
      tandem repeat alleles in exon 1 in the Han population of Ningxia Province, China. 
      The CAG repeat number ranged from 14 to 31 and the frequency ranged from 0.339 to 
      24.460%. Generally, (CAG)n repeat lengths <22 were classified as short (S), and 
      those >22 were classified as long (L). No association was found between breast 
      cancer and the S/L (CAG) variants. However, the frequency of the (CAG)25 repeats 
      in the breast cancer group was significantly higher than that in the control 
      group (P = 0.033, odds ratio = 1.790, 95% confidence interval = 1.044-3.069). 
      These findings indicate a role for AR gene (CAG)n variations in breast cancer and 
      might be informative for future genetic or biological studies on breast cancer, 
      although these findings need replication in other populations.

TI  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A: Co-existence 
      of two rare neuromuscular genetic diseases in the same patient.
PG  - 800-1

LID - 10.1016/j.nmd.2015.07.015 [doi]
AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy is an X-linked neuromuscular disease caused by 
      a trinucleotide CAG repeat expansion in the androgen receptor gene; it is 
      clinically characterized by adult-onset, slowly progressive weakness and atrophy 
      mainly affecting proximal limb and bulbar muscles. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 
      type 1A is an autosomal dominant polyneuropathy due to peripheral myelin protein 
      22 gene duplication and characterized by slowly progressive distal limb muscle 
      weakness, atrophy and sensory loss with foot deformities. Here we report the 
      co-occurrence of both neuromuscular genetic diseases in the same male patient. 
      Difficulties in climbing stairs and jaw weakness were presenting symptoms 
      consistent with SBMA. However, predominant distal weakness and bilateral pes 
      cavus were rather suggestive of a hereditary polyneuropathy. The combination of 
      two diseases, even if extremely rare, should be considered in the presence of 
      atypical symptoms; in the case of genetic diseases this event may have important 
      implications on family members' counseling.

LID - e0134405
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), also called Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), 
      is one of the most common SCAs worldwide and caused by a CAG repeat expansion 
      located in ATXN3 gene. Based on the CAG repeat numbers, alleles of ATXN3 can be 
      divided into normal alleles (ANs), intermediate alleles (AIs) and expanded 
      alleles (AEs). It was controversial whether the frequency of large normal alleles 
      (large ANs) is related to the prevalence of SCA3 or not. And there were huge 
      chaos in the comprehension of the specific numbers of the range of CAG repeats 
      which is fundamental for genetic analysis of SCA3. To illustrate these issues, we 
      made a novel CAG repeat ladder to detect CAG repeats of ATXN3 in 1003 unrelated 
      Chinese normal individuals and studied haplotypes defined by three single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) closed to ATXN3. We found that the number of CAG 
      repeats ranged from 13 to 49, among them, 14 was the most common number. Positive 
      skew, the highest frequency of large ANs and 4 AIs which had never been reported 
      before were found. Also, AEs and large ANs shared the same haplotypes defined by 
      the SNPs. Based on these data and other related studies, we presumed that de novo 
      mutations of ATXN3 emerging from large ANs are at least one survival mechanisms 
      of mutational ATXN3 and we can redefine the range of CAG repeats as: ANs</=44, 45 
      </=AIs </=49 and AEs>/=50.

TI  - Assessment of Correlation between Androgen Receptor CAG Repeat Length and 
      Infertility in Infertile Men Living in Khuzestan, Iran.
PG  - 189-96
AB  - BACKGROUND: The androgen receptor (AR) gene contains a polymorphic trinucleotide 
      repeat that encodes a polyglutamine tract in its N-terminal transactivation 
      domain (N- TAD). We aimed to find a correlation between the length of this 
      polymorphic tract and azoospermia or oligozoospermia in infertile men living in 
      Khuzestan, Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this case-control study during two 
      years till 2010, we searched for microdeletions in the Y chromosome in 84 
      infertile male patients with normal karyotype who lived in Khuzestan Province, 
      Southwest of Iran. All cases (n=12) of azoospermia or oligozoospermia resulting 
      from Y chromosome microdele- tions were excluded from our study. The number of 
      CAG repeats in exon 1 of the AR gene was determined in 72 patients with 
      azoospermia or oligozoospermia and in 72 fertile controls, using the polymerase 
      chain reaction (PCR) and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: 
      Microdeletions were detected in 14.3% (n=12) patients suffering severe 
      oligozoospermia. The mean CAG repeat length was 18.99 +/- 0.35 (range, 11-26) and 
      19.96 +/- 0.54 (range, 12-25) in infertile males and controls, respectively. Also 
      in the infertile group, the most common allele was 19 (26.38%), while in 
      controls, it was 25 (22.22%). CONCLUSION: Y chromosome microdeletions could be 
      one of the main reasons of male infertility living in Khuzestan Province, while 
      there was no correlation between CAG length in AR gene with azoospermia or 
      oligozoospermia in infertile men living in Khuzestan, Iran.

TI  - Association of androgen receptor GGN repeat length polymorphism and male 
      infertility in Khuzestan, Iran.
PG  - 305-10
AB  - BACKGROUND: Androgens play critical role in secondary sexual and male gonads 
      differentiations such as spermatogenesis, via androgen receptor. The human 
      androgen receptor (AR) encoding gene contains two regions with three nucleotide 
      polymorphic repeats (CAG and GGN) in the first exon. Unlike the CAG repeats, the 
      GGN has been less studied because of technical difficulties, so the functional 
      role of these polymorphic repeats is still unclear. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this 
      study was to investigate any relationship between GGN repeat length in the first 
      exon of AR gene and idiopathic male infertility in southwest of Iran. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: This is the first study on GGN repeat of AR gene in infertile male 
      in Khuzestan, Iran. We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and polyacrylamide 
      gel electrophoresis to categorize GGN repeat lengths in 72 infertile and 72 
      fertile men. Afterwards we sequenced the PCR products to determine the exact 
      length of GGN repeat in each category. Our samples included 36 azoospermic and 36 
      oligozoospermic men as cases and 72 fertile men as control group. RESULTS: We 
      found that the numbers of repeats in the cases range from 18 to 25, while in the 
      controls this range is from 20 to 28. The results showed a significant relation 
      between the length of GGN repeat and fertility (p=0.015). The most frequent 
      alleles were alleles with 24 and 25 repeats respectively in case and control 
      groups. On the other hand no significant differences were found between Arab and 
      non-Arab cases by considering GGN repeat lengths (p=0.234). CONCLUSION: Due to 
      our results, there is a significant association between the presence of allele 
      with 24 repeats and susceptibility to male infertility. Therefore this 
      polymorphism should be considered in future studies to clarify etiology of 
      disorders related to androgen receptor activity.

AB  - Disorders of sex development (DSD) affect the development of chromosomal, gonadal 
      and/or anatomical sex. We analyzed a patient with ambiguous genitalia aiming to 
      correlate the genetic findings with the phenotype. Blood and tissue samples from 
      a male patient with penoscrotal hypospadias were analyzed by 
      immunohistochemistry, karyotyping and FISH. DNA was sequenced for the AR, SRY and 
      DHH genes, and further 26 loci in different sex chromosomes were analyzed by 
      MLPA. The gonosomal origin was evaluated by simple tandem repeat (STR) analysis 
      and SNP array. Histopathology revealed a streak gonad, a fallopian tube and a 
      rudimentary uterus, positive for placental alkaline phosphatase, cytokeratin-7 
      and c-kit, and negative for estrogen, androgen and progesterone receptors, 
      alpha-inhibin, alpha-1-fetoprotein, beta-hCG, and oct-4. Karyotyping showed a 
      45,X/46,XY mosaicism, yet FISH showed both 46,XX/46,XY mosaicism (gonad and 
      urethral plate), 46,XX (uterus and tube) and 46,XY karyotypes (rudimentary 
      testicular tissue). DNA sequencing revealed intact sequences in SOX9, WNT4, 
      NR0B1, NR5A1, CYP21A2, SRY, AR, and DHH. STR analysis showed only one maternal 
      allele for all X chromosome markers (uniparental isodisomy, UPD), with a weaker 
      SRY signal and a 4:1 ratio in the X:Y signal. Our findings suggest that the 
      observed complex DSD phenotype is the result of somatic gonosomal mosaicism and 
      UPD despite a normal blood karyotype. The presence of UPD warrants adequate 
      genetic counseling for the family and frequent, lifelong, preventive follow-up 
      controls in the patient.

AB  - The estrogen receptors (ESRalpha and beta) and the androgen receptor (AR) mediate 
      genomic and non-genomic effects on breast tumor growth and proliferation. We 
      analyzed 101 breast cancer patients for allelic loss in microsatellites located 
      in regulatory regions of the ESRs and AR genes in breast cancer tumors. The loss 
      of heterozygosity (LOH) at these loci was found in 36.2% of tumor tissues (ductal 
      carcinoma cases), for 19% of cases at the ESRalpha locus, for 16% at the ESRbeta locus, 
      and for 10% at the AR locus. The LOH in at least one of the two ESR loci was 
      correlated to poor prognosis criteria: ESR-negative status (P = 0.007), 
      PR-negative status (P = 0.003), high Scarff-Bloom-Richardson (SBR) grade 
      (P = 0.0007), high MIB-1 proliferation index (P = 0.02), and diminished apoptosis 
      potential (TP53-positive status, P = 0.018). When AR was also considered, the LOH 
      in at least one of the three loci was associated with ESR-negative status 
      (P = 0.036), PR-negative status (P = 0.027), high SBR grade (P = 0.005), high 
      mitotic index (P = 0.0002), TP53-positive status (P = 0.029), and proliferating 
      index (high MIB-1, P = 0.03). Allelic loss was observed in 26% of normal tissue 
      adjacent to tumor with LOH at the ESRalpha locus and in 7.1% of tumors with LOH at 
      the ESRbeta locus. The LOH in tumor tissue in the regulatory regions of ESRalpha, ESRbeta, 
      and AR genes has potentially synergistic effects on tumor proliferation, 
      histological aggressiveness, down-regulation of ESRalpha and progesterone receptor 
      (PR) genes, and is an early genetic alteration in cancer that is possibly 
      involved in passage to estrogen independence.

TI  - Androgen receptor (AR) gene CAG trinucleotide repeat length associated with body 
      composition measures in non-syndromic obese, non-obese and Prader-Willi syndrome 
      individuals.
PG  - 909-15

AB  - PURPOSE: Total body mass impacts reproductive health and infertility which has 
      increased in the United States with rising rates of obesity. Overlapping genetic 
      and environmental factors contribute to obesity and infertility including the 
      androgen receptor (AR), a steroid hormone-activated transcription factor that is 
      key in regulating androgen activity and sensitivity to sex hormones, weight and 
      body composition in both males and females. The AR gene which is X-linked 
      contains a polymorphic CAG trinucleotide repeat which varies in length and 
      inversely correlated with gene expression. METHODS: We examined the AR gene CAG 
      repeat length and measures of weight and body mass index (BMI) in 27 
      non-syndromic obese and 33 lean controls and for the first time compared with 28 
      individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), a rare obesity-related genetic 
      disorder with natural sex hormone deficits to examine the effects of AR gene CAG 
      repeat length on androgen-mediated response and obesity-related factors relevant 
      to human infertility and reproduction. RESULTS: Mean CAG repeat length in base 
      pairs (278 +/- 7.9) did not significantly differ by subject group (F = 2.6, 
      p = 0.08) but was strongly positively correlated with height standard deviation 
      (SD) among males (r = 0.31, p < 0.05), mainly lean and obese, but not PWS 
      (r = 0.02, p = 0.94). A negative correlation was observed for weight SD among 
      females (r = -0.29, p < 0.04) when grouped together. CONCLUSIONS: The results 
      were consistent with an androgen-mediated effect on height and weight negligible 
      in PWS and supporting the role of sex hormones and AR gene interaction in obesity 
      and infertility, both cardinal features of PWS. CAG repeat length of the AR gene 
      is a marker for increased androgen sensitivity with shorter lengths predicting 
      smaller stature in non-PWS adult males possibly due to accelerating fusion of 
      bone growth plates and reducing the growth phase. Increased androgen effects from 
      shorter CAG repeat lengths in non-PWS females could impact pregnancy-related 
      weight gain and pregnancy outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The peripheral immune system is implicated in modulating microglial 
      activation, neurodegeneration and disease progression in amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS). Specifically, there is reduced thymic function and regulatory T 
      cell (Treg) number in ALS patients and mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) mice, 
      while passive transfer of Tregs ameliorates disease in mutant SOD1 mice. Here, we 
      assessed the effects of augmenting endogenous CD4+ T cell number by stimulating 
      the thymus using surgical castration on the phenotype of transgenic SOD1(G93A) 
      mice. METHOD: Male SOD1(G93A) mice were castrated or sham operated, and weight 
      loss, disease onset and progression were examined. Thymus atrophy and blood CD4+, 
      CD8+ and CD4+ FoxP3+ T cell numbers were determined by fluorescence activated 
      cell sorting (FACS). Motor neuron counts, glial cell activation and androgen 
      receptor (AR) expression in the spinal cord were investigated using 
      immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Differences between castrated and sham 
      mice were analysed using an unpaired t test or one-way ANOVA. RESULTS: Castration 
      significantly increased thymus weight and total CD4+ T cell numbers in SOD1(G93A) 
      mice, although Tregs levels were not affected. Despite this, disease onset and 
      progression were similar in castrated and sham SOD1(G93A) mice. Castration did 
      not affect motor neuron loss or astrocytic activation in spinal cords of 
      SOD1(G93A) mice; however, microglial activation was reduced, specifically M1 
      microglia. We also show that AR is principally expressed in spinal motor neurons 
      and progressively downregulated in spinal cords of SOD1(G93A) mice from disease 
      onset which is further enhanced by castration. CONCLUSIONS: These results 
      demonstrate that increasing thymic function and CD4+ T cell number by castration 
      confers no clinical benefit in mutant SOD1 mice, which may reflect an inability 
      to stimulate neuroprotective Tregs. Nonetheless, castration decreases M1 
      microglial activation in the spinal cord without any clinical improvement and 
      motor neuron rescue, in contrast to other approaches to suppress microglia in 
      mutant SOD1 mice. Lastly, diminished AR expression in spinal motor neurons, which 
      links to another motor neuron disorder, spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), 
      may contribute to ALS pathogenesis and suggests a common disease pathway in ALS 
      and SBMA mediated by disruption of AR signalling in motor neurons.

TI  - Morphological changes of skeletal muscle in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy 
      (SBMA), Kennedy's disease: a case report.
PG  - 199-206
LID - 10.5414/NP300829 [doi]
AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA, Kennedy's disease) is an X-linked 
      recessive disease affecting lower motor neurons. In the present case report, we 
      describe morphological changes in a muscle biopsy obtained from a 62-year-old 
      patient with gynecomastia and with the following neurological symptoms: 
      dysphagia, dysarthria, wasting and fasciculation of the tongue, proximal 
      weakness, fasciculations in the limb muscles, and an absence of all tendon 
      reflexes. Neurogenic alternations were predominantly observed using light and 
      electron microscopy. The angulated atrophic muscle fibers formed bundles. The 
      numerous nuclei were pyknotic or pale, some of them were also ubiquitin positive; 
      they were grouped inside so-called "nuclear sacks". At the ultrastructural level, 
      atrophic muscle fibers revealed disruption and loss of sarcomeres, duplication of 
      Z-line, and rod-like structures. The nuclei, often with irregular shapes, 
      revealed varying degrees of chromatin condensation, from dispersed to highly 
      condensed, like pyknotic nuclei. Occasionally electron-dense inclusions in the 
      nuclei were found. Some myogenic features like hypertrophic muscle fibers and 
      proliferation of connective tissue were also visible. The neurogenic and myogenic 
      pathological changes suggested SBMA, which was confirmed with genetic analysis 
      (trinucleotide CAG (glutamie)-repeat expansion in the androgen-receptor gene).

TI  - Predictors of intramedullary lesion expansion rate on MR images of patients with 
      subaxial spinal cord injury.
PG  - 611-21
LID - 10.3171/2014.10.SPINE14576 [doi]
AB  - OBJECT Studies of preclinical spinal cord injury (SCI) in rodents indicate that 
      expansion of intramedullary lesions (IMLs) seen on MR images may be amenable to 
      neuroprotection. In patients with subaxial SCI and motor-complete American Spinal 
      Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS) Grade A or B, IML expansion has 
      been shown to be approximately 900 mum/hour. In this study, the authors 
      investigated IML expansion in a cohort of patients with subaxial SCI and AIS 
      Grade A, B, C, or D. METHODS Seventy-eight patients who had at least 2 MRI scans 
      within 6 days of SCI were enrolled. Data were analyzed by regression analysis. 
      RESULTS In this cohort, the mean age was 45.3 years (SD 18.3 years), 73 patients 
      were injured in a motor vehicle crash, from a fall, or in sport activities, and 
      77% of them were men. The mean Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 26.7 (SD 16.7), 
      and the AIS grade was A in 23 patients, B in 7, C in 7, and D in 41. The 
      mechanism of injury was distraction in 26 patients, compression in 22, 
      disc/osteophyte complex in 29, and Chance fracture in 1. The mean time between 
      injury onset and the first MRI scan (Interval 1) was 10 hours (SD 8.7 hours), and 
      the mean time to the second MRI scan (Interval 2) was 60 hours (SD 29.6 hours). 
      The mean IML lengths of the first and second MR images were 38.8 mm (SD 20.4 mm) 
      and 51 mm (SD 36.5 mm), respectively. The mean time from the first to the second 
      MRI scan (Interval 3) was 49.9 hours (SD 28.4 hours), and the difference in IML 
      lengths was 12.6 mm (SD 20.7 mm), reflecting an expansion rate of 366 mum/ hour 
      (SD 710 mum/hour). IML expansion in patients with AIS Grades A and B was 918 
      mum/hour (SD 828 mum/hour), and for those with AIS Grades C and D, it was 21 
      mum/hour (SD 304 mum/hour). Univariate analysis indicated that AIS Grade A or B 
      versus Grades C or D (p < 0.0001), traction (p= 0.0005), injury morphology (p < 
      0.005), the surgical approach (p= 0.009), vertebral artery injury (p= 0.02), age 
      (p < 0.05), ISS (p < 0.05), ASIA motor score (p < 0.05), and time to 
      decompression (p < 0.05) were all predictors of lesion expansion. In multiple 
      regression analysis, however, the sole determinant of IML expansion was AIS grade 
      (p < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS After traumatic subaxial cervical spine or spinal cord 
      injury, patients with motor-complete injury (AIS Grade A or B) had a 
      significantly higher rate of IML expansion than those with motor-incomplete 
      injury (AIS Grade C or D).

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Our aim was to determine the presence of a correlation between the 
      nasal airway skeletal transverse dimension and air intake changes in rapid 
      maxillary expansion treatments. METHODS: Sixty-one patients with maxillary 
      transverse deficiency (11-17 years old) were randomly allocated into three groups 
      (two treatment groups - tooth- [hyrax] or bone-borne [miniscrew-implant-based] 
      expander - and one control group). Cone-beam computed tomography scans (CBCT) 
      were obtained from each patient as well as acoustic rhinometry (AR) readings. 
      Specifically, in AR, airway volume up to minimum cross-sectional areas (Vol. 1&2) 
      and minimum cross-sectional areas (Min. 1&2) in the nasal cavity were measured. 
      Records were obtained at two time points (initial T1 and at removal of appliance 
      at 6 months T2). CBCTs were analyzed using AVIZO software and landmarks were 
      placed on the nasal base. Descriptive statistics were compiled and student's 
      t-test was used. RESULTS: Of the 480 pairings measured, only 9 showed 
      statistically significant positive correlations between T1 and T2. Correlation 
      data were highly variable in all categories, showing no clear tendencies. No 
      statistical difference was found when comparing all groups in terms of airway 
      changes. CONCLUSION: With very few positive correlations observed and otherwise 
      highly variable data, no really conclusive finding was obtained to suggest any 
      realistic correlation between changes in the skeletal dimensions and changes in 
      the nasal airway.

AB  - Although somatic alterations in CAG repeats in the androgen receptor (AR) gene 
      have been suggested to predispose to colorectal cancer, less is known about AR in 
      colorectal cancer carcinogenesis. Because of lack of relevant analysis on CAG 
      repeat length and AR expression in colorectal cancer, we aimed to investigate the 
      prognostic value of polymorphic CAG and protein expression of the AR gene in 
      patients with colorectal cancer. A case-control study was carried out on 550 
      patients with colorectal cancer and 540 healthy controls to investigate whether 
      polymorphic CAG within the AR gene is linked to increased risk for colorectal 
      cancer. Polymorphic CAG and AR expression were analyzed to clarify their 
      relationship with clinicopathologic and prognostic factors in patients with 
      colorectal cancer. The study showed that the AR gene in patients with colorectal 
      cancer had a longer CAG repeat sequence than those in the control group, as well 
      as increased risk for colorectal cancer among females (P = 0.013), males (P = 
      0.002), and total colorectal cancer population (P < 0.001), respectively. AR 
      expression exhibited a significant difference in long CAG repeat sequence among 
      males (P < 0.001), females (P < 0.001), and total colorectal cancer study 
      population (P < 0.001). Both long CAG repeat sequence and negative AR expression 
      were associated with a short 5-year overall survival (OS) rate in colorectal 
      cancer. Long CAG repeat sequences and the absence of AR expression were closely 
      related to the development of colorectal cancer. Both long CAG and decreased AR 
      expression were correlated with the poor 5-year OS in patients with colorectal 
      cancer.

PG  - 261-6
AB  - AIM: To determine the relationship between androgen receptor (AR) gene 
      polymorphism and prostate cancer in our society. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Thirty-nine patients diagnosed with prostate cancer and 34 benign prostatic 
      hyperplasia (BPH) patients who were diagnosed in 2010 met the study criteria. The 
      inclusion criteria included patients whose diagnosis was confirmed with a biopsy, 
      with the presence of adequate pathologic material for review, between the ages of 
      40 and 80, and who were healthy men without a family history of prostate cancer. 
      The exclusion criteria excluded men diagnosed with another cancer and those who 
      had kin with a history of prostate cancer. A direct DNA sequencing method was 
      utilized for detection of polymorphisms. RESULTS: CAG repeat length varied from 
      13 to 28 (mean: 21.67) for the BPH group and 12 to 28 (mean: 21.74) for the 
      prostate cancer group. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density and the androgen 
      receptor (AR) CAG repeat had a statistically significant negative correlation in 
      the BPH group. A statistically significant difference was associated between AR 
      CAG repeat and PSA density. CONCLUSION: Randomized prospective studies should be 
      planned with larger patient and control groups and with more variables, which may 
      open new horizons in prostate cancer screening and early detection.

PG  - 886-96
AB  - While androgen and androgen receptor (AR) activity have been strongly implicated 
      in prostate cancer development and therapy, the influence of the CAG repeat, 
      which is found within the first exon of the AR gene, on prostate carcinogenesis 
      is still unclear. We investigated the differences in the length of the CAG repeat 
      between prostate cancer patients and controls in the Chinese population as well 
      as between TMPRSS2:ERG fusion positive and negative samples. A general 
      association between prostate cancer and either longer or shorter AR CAG repeat 
      length was not observed in the Chinese population. However, our data suggest that 
      certain CAG repeat lengths may increase or decrease prostate cancer risk. Shorter 
      CAG repeat length was also not shown to be associated with a higher induction 
      rate of TMPRSS2 and ERG proximity, an essential step for TMPRSS2:ERG fusion 
      formation. However, samples with a CAG repeat of 17 were found more frequently in 
      the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion positive than negative prostate cancer cases and mediated 
      a higher rate of androgen-induced TMPRSS2 and ERG co-localisation than AR with 
      longer (24) and shorter (15) CAG repeats. This suggests that 17 CAG repeats may 
      be associated with TMPRSS2:ERG fusion positive prostate cancer, but may have a 
      preventive role for prostate cancer in the Chinese population, which has a low 
      TMPRSS2:ERG fusion frequency. This study suggests that different mechanisms for 
      the association of CAG repeat length polymorphism and prostate cancer exist in 
      different ethnic populations.

TI  - Anthropometry in Klinefelter syndrome--multifactorial influences due to CAG 
      length, testosterone treatment and possibly intrauterine hypogonadism.
PG  - E508-17
LID - 10.1210/jc.2014-2834 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Klinefelter syndrome, 47, XXY (KS), is underdiagnosed partly due to few 
      clinical signs complicating identification of affected individuals. Certain 
      phenotypic traits are common in KS. However, not all aspects of the KS phenotype 
      are well described. OBJECTIVE: To describe anthropometry and body composition in 
      KS and relate findings to biochemistry and X-chromosome related genetic markers. 
      DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventy three KS males referred to our clinic 
      and 73 age-matched controls underwent comprehensive measurements of anthropometry 
      and body composition in a cross-sectional, case-controlled study. Furthermore, 
      genetic analysis for parental origin of the supernumerary X-chromosome, skewed 
      X-chromosome inactivation and androgen receptor (AR) CAG repeat length was done. 
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Anthropometry and body composition in KS and the effect of 
      genotype hereon. RESULTS: KS males were taller (absolute difference: 5.1 cm, P < 
      .001) with longer legs (5.7 cm, P < .001) compared with controls. Furthermore, 
      2D:4D was increased in KS males (relative effect size: Cohen's d = 0.40), 
      reflecting reduced fetal testosterone exposure. Also, bi-iliac width (0.41), 
      waist (0.52), and hip circumference (0.47) (P < .02 for all), as well as total 
      fat mass (0.74), abdominal fat mass (0.67), and total body fat percentage (0.84) 
      was increased in KS males (P < .001 for all), while bitesticular volume was 
      reduced (4.6). AR CAG repeat length was comparable in KS and controls, and among 
      KS CAG correlated to arm length (P = .04), arm span (P = .01), and leg length (P 
      = .04). Effects of parental origin of the supernumerary X-chromosome and skewed 
      X-chromosome inactivation were negligible. CONCLUSIONS: Anthropometry and body 
      composition in KS is specific and dysmorphic and affected by AR CAG repeat length 
      and decreased exposure to testosterone already during fetal life.

AB  - The molecular background of disorders of sex development (DSD) in cats is poorly 
      recognized. In this study we present cytogenetic, molecular and histological 
      analyses of four cats subjected for the analysis due to ambiguous external 
      genitalia. Three cases, with rudimentary penises and an abnormal position of the 
      urethral orifice, represented different types of hypospadias. The fourth case had 
      a normal penis, a blind vulva and spermatogenetically active testes. Histological 
      studies showed structures typical of testes, but spermatogenic activity was 
      observed in two cats only. All the cats had a normal male chromosome complement 
      (38,XY) and the Y-chromosome linked genes (SRY and ZFY) were also detected. 
      Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), with the use of the feline BAC probe 
      harboring the SRY gene, excluded the possibility of chromosome translocation of 
      the Y chromosome fragment carrying the SRY gene onto another chromosome. 
      Sequencing of four candidate genes (SRY--sex determining region Y; AR--androgen 
      receptor; SRD5A2--steroid-5-alfa reductase 2 and MAMLD1--mastermind-like domain 
      containing (1) revealed one SNP in the SRY gene, one common polymorphism in exon 
      1 of the AR gene (tandem repeat of a tri-nucleotide motif--CAG), six 
      polymorphisms (5 SNPs and 1 indel) in the SRD5A2 gene and one SNP in the MAMLD1 
      gene. Molecular studies of the candidate genes showed no association with the 
      identified polymorphisms, thus molecular background of the studied DSD phenotypes 
      remains unknown.

TI  - Androgen Receptor CAG Repeat Length in Relation to Phenotype Among Females with 
      Nonclassical 21-Hydroxylase Deficiency.
PG  - 491-6
LID - 10.1055/s-0034-1389901 [doi]
AB  - Nonclassical 21-hydroxylase deficiency (NC21OHD) manifests with various degrees 
      of post natal virilization. The length of CAG repeats of the androgen receptor 
      gene (AR) is inversely correlated to activity of the human androgen receptor (AR) 
      and affects phenotype of several androgen-dependent disorders. The aim of the 
      study was to investigate the associations between CAG repeat length and the 
      phenotype of females with NC21OHD. CAG repeat length and AR inactivation were 
      assessed in females with NC21OHD, and related to their clinical presentation. CAG 
      repeat length and AR inactivation were assessed in 119 females with NC21OHD. 
      Biallelic mean (BAM) of the CAG repeat length and the weighted BAM (WBAM) were 
      related to various clinical parameters. Age at diagnosis and age of menarche 
      positively correlated with BAM (r=0.22, p=0.02, and r=0.23, p=0.01, 
      respectively). A shorter (<25) BAM was associated with younger age at diagnosis 
      (14.8 vs. 21.4 years, p<0.01), at adrenarche (8.1 vs. 10.2 years, p<0.01) and 
      gonadarche (9.9 vs. 11.2 years, p<0.01), and higher corrected height standard 
      deviation score at diagnosis (0.77 vs. 0.15, p=0.01). Precocious pubarche and 
      precocious puberty were more frequent in these with the shorter BAM. Results of 
      WBAM were similar. The CAG repeat length of the AR gene contributes to the 
      clinical diversity of the phenotype in females with NC21OHD.

AB  - Epidemiologic and biological data suggest a role for androgens and perhaps their 
      receptor in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. However, few studies 
      evaluated an association between HCC risk and androgen receptor (AR) cytosine, 
      adenine, guanine (CAG) repeat length. To examine whether the relationship between 
      the AR CAG repeats and HCC risk was also evident in Chinese, we conducted this 
      large population-based, case-control study of 2,000 pathologically confirmed HCC 
      patients and 2,000 frequency-matched controls. Two different approaches for AR 
      CAG repeat length (analyses with continuous and categorized polymorphism 
      variables) were conducted in the statistical analyses. For AR CAG longer allele 
      (CAG_L), we found that subjects with longer AR CAG_L repeats had a decreased risk 
      of developing HCC (OR = 0.87 for per CAG_A increase, 95 % CI 0.82-0.96, 
      P = 5.33 x 10(-4)). Compared to those with the shorter (<23) CAG_L repeat length, 
      subjects in the category of longer (>/=23) CAG_L repeats had a significant 20 % 
      decreased HCC risk (OR = 0.80, 95 % CI 0.71-0.91, P = 6.16 x 10(-4)). These 
      findings suggest that androgen signaling underlies the development of HCC.

TI  - Atypical polycystic ovary syndrome--a genetic analysis.
PG  - 55-60
LID - 10.1055/s-0034-1387735 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Although polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common 
      endocrinopathy the pathogenesis is not entirely understood. Typically, high 
      androgen levels are associated with increased virilization. We report 2 rare 
      groups of patients with either unexpectedly high testosterone levels despite low 
      virilization as well as patients with low testosterone levels despite high grade 
      of virilization. One possibility for the atypical PCOS may be based on an altered 
      androgen receptor (AR) signaling. METHODS: 6 patients and when available the 
      parents were included in this study. Alterations of the metaphase chromosomes by 
      GTG staining, the length of both the trinucleotide CAG- and GGC-repeats of the 
      androgen receptor (AR) gene was determined by PCR, further the entire AR gene was 
      sequenced and analyzed. RESULTS: The GTG banding revealed no chromosomal 
      alterations and the range of CAG- and GGC-repeat lengths are within the normal 
      range. Interestingly, by sequencing of the entire AR gene few genetic mutations 
      were identified. CONCLUSION: The detected mutations do not alter the AR protein 
      sequence but they change the codon usage towards less frequent codons that 
      potentially may alter AR protein levels and androgen signaling. In addition to 
      this, we postulate also other causes for manifestation of atypical PCOS, which 
      may include AR-coregulators or epigenetic alterations. To our knowledge this is 
      the first report of combining chromosomal analysis of PCOS patients with full 
      sequencing of the human AR gene and linking codon usage to PCOS.

TI  - Synergic prodegradative activity of Bicalutamide and trehalose on the mutant 
      androgen receptor responsible for spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.
PG  - 64-75
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddu419 [doi]
AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an X-linked motoneuron disease due 
      to a CAG triplet-repeat expansion in the androgen receptor (AR) gene, which is 
      translated into an elongated polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in AR protein (ARpolyQ). 
      ARpolyQ toxicity is activated by the AR ligand testosterone (or 
      dihydrotestosterone), and the polyQ triggers ARpolyQ misfolding and aggregation 
      in spinal cord motoneurons and muscle cells. In motoneurons, testosterone 
      triggers nuclear toxicity by inducing AR nuclear translocation. Thus, (i) 
      prevention of ARpolyQ nuclear localization, combined with (ii) an increased 
      ARpolyQ cytoplasmic clearance, should reduce its detrimental activity. Using the 
      antiandrogen Bicalutamide (Casodex((R))), which slows down AR activation and 
      nuclear translocation, and the disaccharide trehalose, an autophagy activator, we 
      found that, in motoneurons, the two compounds together reduced ARpolyQ insoluble 
      forms with higher efficiency than that obtained with single treatments. The 
      ARpolyQ clearance was mediated by trehalose-induced autophagy combined with the 
      longer cytoplasmic retention of ARpolyQ bound to Bicalutamide. This allows an 
      increased recognition of misfolded species by the autophagic system prior to 
      their migration into the nucleus. Interestingly, the combinatory use of trehalose 
      and Bicalutamide was also efficient in the removal of insoluble species of AR 
      with a very long polyQ (Q112) tract, which typically aggregates into the cell 
      nuclei. Collectively, these data suggest that the combinatory use of Bicalutamide 
      and trehalose is a novel approach to facilitate ARpolyQ clearance that has to be 
      tested in other cell types target of SBMA (i.e. muscle cells) and in vivo in 
      animal models of SBMA.

AB  - X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) is the epigenetic transcriptional silencing of an 
      X-chromosome during the early stages of embryonic development in female eutherian 
      mammals. XCI assures monoallelic expression in each cell and compensation for 
      dosage-sensitive X-linked genes between females (XX) and males (XY). DNA 
      methylation at the carbon-5 position of the cytosine pyrimidine ring in the 
      context of a CpG dinucleotide sequence (5meCpG) in promoter regions is a key 
      epigenetic marker for transcriptional gene silencing. Using computational 
      analysis, we revealed an extragenic tandem GAAA repeat 230-bp from the landmark 
      CpG island of the human X-linked retinitis pigmentosa 2 RP2 promoter whose 5meCpG 
      status correlates with XCI. We used this RP2 onshore tandem GAAA repeat to 
      develop an allele-specific 5meCpG-based PCR assay that is highly concordant with 
      the human androgen receptor (AR) exonic tandem CAG repeat-based standard HUMARA 
      assay in discriminating active (Xa) from inactive (Xi) X-chromosomes. The RP2 
      onshore tandem GAAA repeat contains neutral features that are lacking in the AR 
      disease-linked tandem CAG repeat, is highly polymorphic (heterozygosity rates 
      approximately 0.8) and shows minimal variation in the Xa/Xi ratio. The combined 
      informativeness of RP2/AR is approximately 0.97, and this assay excels at 
      determining the 5meCpG status of alleles at the Xp (RP2) and Xq (AR) chromosome 
      arms in a single reaction. These findings are relevant and directly translatable 
      to nonhuman primate models of XCI in which the AR CAG-repeat is monomorphic. We 
      conducted the RP2 onshore tandem GAAA repeat assay in the naturally occurring 
      chimeric New World monkey marmoset (Callitrichidae) and found it to be 
      informative. The RP2 onshore tandem GAAA repeat will facilitate studies on the 
      variable phenotypic expression of dominant and recessive X-linked diseases, 
      epigenetic changes in twins, the physiology of aging hematopoiesis, the 
      pathogenesis of age-related hematopoietic malignancies and the clonality of 
      cancers in human and nonhuman primates.

AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an X-linked neuromuscular disease 
      caused by a trinucleotide (CAG) repeat expansion in the androgen receptor gene. 
      Patients with SBMA have weakness, atrophy, and fasciculations in the bulbar and 
      extremity muscles. Individuals with CAG repeat lengths greater than 62 have not 
      previously been reported. We evaluated a 29year old SBMA patient with 68 CAGs who 
      had unusually early onset and findings not seen in others with the disease. 
      Analysis of the androgen receptor gene confirmed the repeat length of 68 CAGs in 
      both peripheral blood and fibroblasts. Evaluation of muscle and sensory function 
      showed deficits typical of SBMA, and in addition the patient had manifestations 
      of autonomic dysfunction and abnormal sexual development. These findings extend 
      the known phenotype associated with SBMA and shed new insight into the effects of 
      the mutated androgen receptor.

TI  - Associations between androgen receptor CAG & GGN repeat polymorphism & recurrent 
      spontaneous abortions in Chinese women.
PG  - 730-6
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) is a reproductive 
      problem that occurs in women in reproductive age with a frequency of 1-3 per 
      cent. Previous studies have reported high levels of serum androgens to be 
      associated with RSAs. At the molecular level, the effect of androgens is mediated 
      through the activation of the androgen receptor (AR). The CAG and GGN repeat 
      polymorphisms of the AR gene are associated with the AR activity. We hypothesize 
      that the AR CAG/GGN repeat polymorphism may be associated with levels of serum 
      androgens. Thus, this study as undertaken to evaluate the relationship between 
      CAG/GGN repeats in exon 1 of the AR gene in women with RSAs. METHODS: This 
      case-control study was performed in Ningxia, PR China, including 149 women with 
      RSAs and 210 controls. The CAG and GGN repeats of the AR gene were genotyped 
      using a PCR-based assay and were analyzed using Peak Scanner Software v1.0 to 
      determine the CAG/GGN repeat length. RESULTS: CAG repeats ranged from 15 to 29 in 
      the RSA patients, compared to 14 to 35 in the control group. The median value of 
      CAG repeats was 22 for the RSA group and 24 for control group. The total AR CAG 
      alleles (</=22 repeats), shorter AR CAG alleles (</=22 repeats), and biallelic means 
      (</=22.5 repeats) were significantly different in the RSA group in comparison to 
      the control group ( P <0.001, P <0.01). The median value of the GGN repeats was 
      23 for the cases and 22 for controls. The total number of AR GGN alleles (</=23 
      repeats) was significantly different in the RSA group compared to the control 
      group ( P <0.5). There was no difference between the RSA group and the control 
      groups in regards to shorter alleles, longer alleles, and biallelic means. 
      INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Our observation suggests that the CAG and GGN 
      repeat length is shorter in women with RSAs as compared with controls and that 
      shorter CAG and GGN repeats may be pathogenic for RSAs in Chinese women. Further 
      studies need to be done in different ethnic populations.

TI  - The association between androgen receptor gene CAG polymorphism and polycystic 
      ovary syndrome: a case-control study and meta-analysis.
PG  - 1211-9
LID - 10.1007/s10815-014-0286-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Many studies have been carried out to confirm the relationship between 
      androgen receptor gene CAG repeat polymorphism and polycystic ovary syndrome 
      (PCOS), without consistent results. Hence we conducted the current study to 
      research this relationship. METHODS: 224 Chinese Han women with PCOS and 223 in 
      vitro fertilization and embryo transplantation (IVF-ET) infertile women with 
      tubal factor or male infertility served as the controls were recruited in our 
      study. PCR-based assays were applied to genotype the (CAG)n repeat alleles. A 
      meta-analysis including 1,536 PCOS patients and 1,807 controls was conducted to 
      produce a pooled estimate. RESULTS: We observed that the CAG bi-allelic mean 
      lengths were similar in PCOS patients and controls (22.65 +/- 2.5 vs. 23.09 +/- 2.1, 
      P = 0.116). When CAG bi-allelic were divided into two categories (mean repeats 
      </=22, >22), the short AR-CAG bi-allelic showed more frequent in PCOS group than in 
      controls (56.25% vs 29.14%, P < 0.001). Further analysis presented that, in PCOS, 
      there was a lower mean CAG repeat lengths in mean bi-allelic lengths (22.3 +/- 2.5 
      vs. 23.9 +/- 2.2, P = 0.008) and long bi-allelic lengths (24.3 +/- 1.4 vs. 
      25.9 +/- 1.6, P = 0.05) among patients with testosterone less than 0.7 ng/ml 
      compared with those whose testosterone was more than 0.7 ng/ml. Besides, the 
      testosterone were positively correlated with the CAG polymorphism (r = 0.237, 
      P = 0.008), which accorded with our meta-analysis results. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      distribution of AR-CAG allele differed between PCOS patients and controls, and 
      polymorphism of CAG repeat lengths may contribute to hyperandrogenism in PCOS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: ODM-201 is a novel androgen receptor (AR) inhibitor designed to block 
      the growth of prostate cancer cells through high-affinity binding to the AR and 
      inhibition of AR nuclear translocation. This trial assessed ODM-201's safety, 
      pharmacokinetics, and activity in men with metastatic castration-resistant 
      prostate cancer. METHODS: The ARADES trial is an open-label phase 1-2 trial 
      undertaken in 23 hospitals across Europe and USA with ongoing long-term 
      follow-up. Men with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, 
      who had castrate concentrations of testosterone and an Eastern Cooperative 
      Oncology Group score of 0-1 were enrolled. In the phase 1 part of the trial, 
      patients were given oral ODM-201 at a starting daily dose of 200 mg, which was 
      increased to 400 mg, 600 mg, 1000 mg, 1400 mg, and 1800 mg. In phase 2, patients 
      were randomly assigned centrally and stratified by previous chemotherapy and 
      treatment with CPY17 inhibitors, to receive one of three daily doses of ODM-201 
      (200 mg, 400 mg, and 1400 mg). The primary endpoint in phase 1 was safety and 
      tolerability, whereas in phase 2 it was the proportion of patients with a PSA 
      response (50% or greater decrease in serum PSA) at week 12. All analyses included 
      patients who had received at least one dose of ODM-201. This trial is registered 
      with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01317641, and NCT01429064 for the follow-up 
      after 12 weeks. FINDINGS: We enrolled patients between April 5, 2011, and March 
      12, 2013. In phase 1, 24 patients were enrolled to six sequential cohorts of 
      three to six patients and received a daily dose of ODM-201, 200-1800 mg. No 
      dose-limiting toxic effects were reported and the maximum tolerated dose was not 
      reached. In phase 1, three patients reported eight adverse events of grade 3 
      (fracture, muscle injury, laceration, paralytic ileus, pain, presyncope, urinary 
      retention, and vomiting) and one patient had a grade 4 adverse event 
      (lymphoedema). None of the grade 3-4 adverse events were deemed to be related to 
      ODM-201. Of the phase 1 patients, the four who received 200 mg, seven who 
      received 400 mg, and three who received 1400 mg entered the phase 2 part of the 
      trial. In addition to these patients, 110 were randomly assigned to three groups: 
      200 mg (n=38), 400 mg (n=37), and 1400 mg (n=35). For these patients, the most 
      common treatment-emergent adverse events were fatigue or asthenia (15 [12%] of 
      124 patients), hot flush (six [5%]), and decreased appetite (five [4%]). One 
      patient (<1%) had a grade 3 treatment-emergent adverse event (fatigue); no 
      patients had a treatment-emergent grade 4 adverse event. 38 patients who received 
      200 mg, 39 who received 400 mg, and 33 who received 1400 mg were assessable for 
      PSA response at 12 weeks. 11 (29%) patients in the 200 mg group, 13 (33%) in the 
      400 mg group, and 11 (33%) in the 1400 mg group had a PSA response at 12 weeks. 
      INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that ODM-201 monotherapy in men with 
      progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer provides disease 
      suppression and that ODM-201 has a favourable safety profile. These findings 
      support further investigation of clinical responses with ODM-201 in men with 
      castration-resistant prostate cancer. FUNDING: Orion Corporation Orion Pharma,

TI  - A preliminary case study of androgen receptor gene polymorphism association with 
      impulsivity in women with alcoholism.
PG  - 5-13
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The androgen receptor (AR) gene, located on the X chromosome, contains 
      a common polymorphism involving cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeats, which 
      impacts disease and could contribute to the unequal sex ratio in alcoholism. CAG 
      repeats in the AR gene are known to correlate with impulsivity in males. We 
      report the first preliminary study examining the association between the number 
      of CAG repeats and measures of impulsivity in females with chronic alcoholism. 
      METHODS: A total of 35 women and 85 men with chronic alcoholism were previously 
      recruited for a nutritional clinical trial, and 26 well-characterized females (19 
      African-American and seven Caucasian) with alcoholism agreed to participate for 
      genetic testing. Genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was isolated from peripheral 
      blood and CAG repeats determined by analyzing polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR)-amplified products, using the polymorphic AR gene assay. CAG repeat length 
      was correlated with raw scores from the Barratt Impulsivity Scale, version 11 and 
      the Alcoholism Severity Scale. RESULTS: CAG repeat lengths were significantly 
      longer in Caucasian alcoholic women compared with African-Americans, and the 
      average number of CAG repeats were significantly, positively correlated (P<0.05) 
      with impulsivity scores. Women with average CAG repeat length (CAG(ave)) >/=18, 
      representing the upper quartile of the repeat range, showed significantly greater 
      mean raw impulsivity scores. CAG repeat length appeared to have less effect in 
      African-American compared with Caucasian women, possibly due to a shorter average 
      repeat length. CONCLUSION: We found an association between the number of CAG 
      repeats and impulsivity in females with chronic alcoholism, specifically in women 
      with CAG(ave) >/=18, seen more commonly in Caucasian compared with African-American 
      women.

TI  - Androgen receptor CAG repeat polymorphism and risk of TMPRSS2:ERG-positive 
      prostate cancer.
PG  - 2027-31

AB  - BACKGROUND: The androgen receptor (AR) is an essential gene in prostate cancer 
      pathogenesis and progression. Genetic variation in AR exists, including a 
      polymorphic CAG repeat sequence that is inversely associated with transcriptional 
      activity. Experimental data suggest that heightened AR activity facilitates 
      formation of TMPRSS2:ERG, a gene fusion present in approximately 50% of tumors of 
      patients with prostate cancer. METHODS: We undertook a nested case-control study 
      to investigate the hypothesis that shorter CAG repeat length would be associated 
      with prostate cancer risk defined by TMPRSS2:ERG status. The study included 291 
      men with prostate cancer (147 ERG-positive) and 1,221 cancer-free controls. ORs 
      and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using logistic regression. 
      RESULTS: Median CAG repeat length (interquartile range) among controls was 22 
      (20-24). Men with shorter CAG repeats had an increased risk of ERG-positive (OR, 
      1.07 per 1 repeat decrease; 95% CI, 1.00-1.14), but not ERG-negative prostate 
      cancer (OR, 0.99 per 1 repeat decrease; 95% CI, 0.93-1.05). CONCLUSIONS: These 
      data suggest that shorter CAG repeats are specifically associated with 
      development of TMPRSS2:ERG-positive prostate cancer. IMPACT: Our results provide 
      supportive evidence that androgen signaling underlies the development of prostate 
      tumors that harbor TMPRSS2:ERG. Moreover, these results suggest that TMPRSS2:ERG 
      may represent a unique molecular subtype of prostate cancer with an etiology 
      distinct from TMPRSS2:ERG-negative disease.

AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA, Kennedy's disease) is a motor neuron 
      disease caused by polyglutamine repeat expansion in the androgen receptor. 
      Although degeneration occurs in the spinal cord and muscle, the exact mechanism 
      is not clear. Induced pluripotent stem cells from spinal and bulbar muscular 
      atrophy patients provide a useful model for understanding the disease mechanism 
      and designing effective therapy. Stem cells were generated from six patients and 
      compared to control lines from three healthy individuals. Motor neurons from four 
      patients were differentiated from stem cells and characterized to understand 
      disease-relevant phenotypes. Stem cells created from patient fibroblasts express 
      less androgen receptor than control cells, but show androgen-dependent 
      stabilization and nuclear translocation. The expanded repeat in several stem cell 
      clones was unstable, with either expansion or contraction. Patient stem cell 
      clones produced a similar number of motor neurons compared to controls, with or 
      without androgen treatment. The stem cell-derived motor neurons had 
      immunoreactivity for HB9, Isl1, ChAT, and SMI-32, and those with the largest 
      repeat expansions were found to have increased acetylated alpha-tubulin and reduced 
      HDAC6. Reduced HDAC6 was also found in motor neuron cultures from two other 
      patients with shorter repeats. Evaluation of stably transfected mouse cells and 
      SBMA spinal cord showed similar changes in acetylated alpha-tubulin and HDAC6. 
      Perinuclear lysosomal enrichment, an HDAC6 dependent process, was disrupted in 
      motor neurons from two patients with the longest repeats. SBMA stem cells present 
      new insights into the disease, and the observations of reduced androgen receptor 
      levels, repeat instability, and reduced HDAC6 provide avenues for further 
      investigation of the disease mechanism and development of effective therapy.

AB  - We report a case of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), also known as 
      Kennedy disease, with a 38 CAG-repeat expansion in exon-1 of the androgen 
      receptor gene, presenting with a 2-year history of mild speech difficulty, 
      dysphonia, and occasional choking. Initial clinical features and complementary 
      studies were consistent with SBMA. The disease progression, as assessed by the 
      Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised, remained stable 
      over the first 5 years from the onset but showed a rapid decline (from 42 to 24 
      points) over the next 18 months before his death. In the later stages of the 
      disease, deep tendon reflexes were preserved in limbs and a brisk jaw-jerk reflex 
      and bilateral Hoffmann sign were evident. Survival from disease onset was 78 
      months. The final cause of death was aspiration pneumonia. The atypical clinical 
      features, evolution, and accelerated disease course are not concordant with the 
      relatively short 38 CAG-repeat expansion in the androgen receptor gene. This may 
      represent either a variant SBMA phenotype, which has not been recorded to date, 
      or the development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in a known case of SBMA.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between the length of the polymorphic 
      trinucleotide CAG microsatellite repeats in exon 1 of the AR gene and the risk of 
      prostate cancer containing TMPRSS2:ETS fusion genes. METHODS: This nested 
      case-control study came from subjects enrolled in the Prostate Cancer Prevention 
      Trial and included 195 biopsy-proven prostate cancer cases with a known 
      TMPRSS2:ETS status and 1344 matched controls. RESULTS: There was no association 
      between the CAG repeat length and the risk of TMPRSS2:ETS-positive (odds ratio, 
      0.97; 95% confidence interval, 0.91-1.04) or TMPRSS2:ETS-negative prostate cancer 
      (odds ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.97-1.11) and in patients with low- 
      or high-grade disease. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that AR CAG repeats are 
      not associated with TMPRSS2:ETS formation in prostate cancer.

AB  - X-chromosome inactivation pattern (XCIP) analysis has been widely used to assess 
      cell clonality in various types of human neoplasms. In this study, a polymerase 
      chain reaction-based canine XCIP analysis of the androgen receptor (AR) gene was 
      applied for the assessment of cell clonality in canine hematopoietic tumors. This 
      XCIP analysis is based on the polymorphic CAG repeats in the AR gene and the 
      difference of methylation status between active and inactive X chromosomes. We 
      first examined the polymorphisms of 2 CAG tandem repeats in the AR gene in 52 
      male and 150 female dogs of various breeds. The 2 polymorphic CAG repeats 
      contained 9 to 12 and 10 to 14 CAGs in the first and second CAG repeats, 
      respectively. Of the 150 female dogs, 74 (49.3%) were heterozygous for the first 
      and/or second polymorphic CAG tandem repeats, indicating the utility of XCIP 
      analysis in these dogs. Canine XCIP analysis was then applied to clinical samples 
      from female dogs with canine high-grade lymphoma, chronic myelogenous leukemia, 
      acute myelogenous leukemia, and benign lymph node hyperplasia. Of 10 lymphoma 
      cell samples, 9 (90%) showed skewed XCIPs, indicating their clonal origins, 
      whereas all the nonneoplastic lymph node samples showed balanced XCIPs. Moreover, 
      bone marrow specimen from a dog with acute myelogenous leukemia and peripheral 
      leukocyte specimens from 2 dogs with chronic myelogenous leukemia showed skewed 
      XCIPs. XCIP analysis was successfully employed to demonstrate the cell clonality 
      of canine hematopoietic tumors in this study and will be applicable to evaluate 
      the clonality in various proliferative disorders in dogs.

AB  - X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is characterized by 
      adult-onset muscle weakness and lower motor neuron degeneration. SBMA is caused 
      by CAG-polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansions in the androgen receptor (AR) 
      gene. Pathological findings include motor neuron loss, with polyQ-AR accumulation 
      in intranuclear inclusions. SBMA patients exhibit myopathic features, suggesting 
      a role for muscle in disease pathogenesis. To determine the contribution of 
      muscle, we developed a BAC mouse model featuring a floxed first exon to permit 
      cell-type-specific excision of human AR121Q. BAC fxAR121 mice develop systemic 
      and neuromuscular phenotypes, including shortened survival. After validating 
      termination of AR121 expression and full rescue with ubiquitous Cre, we crossed 
      BAC fxAR121 mice with Human Skeletal Actin-Cre mice. Muscle-specific excision 
      prevented weight loss, motor phenotypes, muscle pathology, and motor neuronopathy 
      and dramatically extended survival. Our results reveal a crucial role for muscle 
      expression of polyQ-AR in SBMA and suggest muscle-directed therapies as effective 
      treatments.

TI  - Variation in the androgen receptor gene exon 1 CAG repeat correlates with 
      manifestations of autoimmunity in women with lupus.

LID - 10.1530/EC-14-0039 [doi]
AB  - Clinical and experimental evidence support a role for gonadal steroids in 
      modulating the expression and course of autoimmune diseases such as lupus. 
      Whether or not inherited variation in sensitivity to circulating androgenic 
      hormones could influence the manifestations of such disease is, however, unknown. 
      We sought to determine whether differences in androgen sensitivity conferred by 
      variation in the exon 1 CAG repeat region of the androgen receptor (AR) gene were 
      associated with differences in the clinical or humoral immune manifestations of 
      lupus in a cohort of female subjects. We found that shorter AR CAG repeat lengths 
      in lupus subjects correlated with a higher Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease 
      Activity Index score, higher ANA levels, and expression of a broader array of IgG 
      autoantibodies. Our findings of more severe clinical manifestations and more 
      exuberant humoral autoimmunity in women with a shorter AR exon 1 CAG repeat 
      length suggest a role for genetically determined sensitivity to androgens as a 
      modulator of autoimmune processes.

TI  - Could androgen receptor gene CAG tract polymorphism affect spermatogenesis in men 
      with idiopathic infertility?
PG  - 689-97
LID - 10.1007/s10815-014-0221-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study examined whether the AR-CAG repeat length might affect 
      clinical characteristics (testis volume) seminal parameters (sperm count and its 
      mobility) along with hormonal serum profile [FSH, LH, Testosterone (T) and 
      Inhibin B (InhB)] both in idiopathic male infertility (IM) and in infertility due 
      to a previous condition of cryptorchidism (CryM) or to Y chromosome long arm 
      microdeletions (YM). DESIGN: Observational study without intervention(s). 
      PATIENTS: One hundred and ten IM patients [90 idiopathic olizoospermic males 
      (IOM) and 20 idiopathic azoospermic males (IAM)], 19 CryM male and 10 YM patients 
      were included. Sixty-one age-matched healthy men who had fathered within 3 years 
      were involved representing the control group (FM). RESULTS: AR-CAG repeats 
      stretch was significantly longer in IOM (p<0.05), CryM (p<0.05) and YM (p<0.001) 
      than FM. When the AR-CAG repeat tracts were subdivided in three subgroups 
      according to the length of CAG repeats tract assessed in fertile subjects (the 
      one with the middle (n 19-21) belonging to the 25 and 75 % inter-quartile, the 
      ends belonging to the <25 % inter-quartile and >75 % inter-quartile, 
      respectively), there was a statistically significant difference of distribution 
      of AR-CAG tract length among fertile and different groups of infertile men 
      (p=<0.0005; chi-square test). Moreover, the subgroup of AR-CAG repeat stretch 
      with 22-28 triplets was associated with lower levels of InhB both in idiopathic 
      oligozoospermic (Scheffe, Bonferroni and Dunett tests p=<0.01) and azoospermic 
      men (Scheffe, Bonferroni and Dunett test p=<0.05), while, when FM and men with 
      idiopathic infertility were gathered in a single group, both the subgroup of AR- 
      CAG tract with 15-18 repeats and the one with 22-28 repeats are associated with 
      lower testis volume, reduced sperm count and serum InhB levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      study showed that the outliers of AR-CAG repeat length seem to influence the 
      function of AR, affecting testis volume and Sertoli cell function and 
      consequently sperm production in both fertile and idiopathic infertile men.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine the association of non-random X 
      chromosome inactivation (XCI) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at Xq25 with 
      breast cancer development. METHODS: Seventy-nine breast cancer patients, 39 
      female lung cancer patients, 30 other cancer patients and 77 healthy females were 
      analysed for LOH using a panel of 11 microsatellite markers spanning Xq25. The 
      androgen receptor (AR) gene was chosen as an XCI marker. RESULTS: LOH of at least 
      one microsatellite locus at Xq25 was identified in 46/65 breast cancers examined, 
      while only 10/25 cancers of other origins demonstrated LOH in this region (p = 
      0.014). The critical deletion region in breast cancer was around marker DXS1047 
      (47.23%). Moreover, we found that tissues from eight breast cancers showed LOH at 
      all of the informative loci tested at Xq25, while the other 38 showed partial 
      (interstitial or telomeric) alterations at Xq25. Interestingly, the pattern of 
      XCI of these eight breast cancers tended to be non-random. We estimated the 
      frequencies of AR alleles and found that women with two long AR alleles (>/=21 CAG 
      repeats) had an increased risk of developing breast cancer, while those with two 
      short AR alleles (<21 CAG repeats) were likely to be normal (p = 0.00069). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The extraordinary high frequencies of LOH at Xq25 found in this 
      study strongly imply that there might be one or more tumour suppressor genes 
      (TSGs) related to the development of breast cancer at Xq25 in the Taiwanese 
      female population.

AB  - PURPOSE: To study cerebral adenosine receptors (AR) in premanifest and manifest 
      stages of Huntington's disease (HD). METHODS: We quantified the cerebral binding 
      potential (BP ND) of the A(1)AR in carriers of the HD CAG trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion using the radioligand [(18) F]CPFPX and PET. Four groups were 
      investigated: (i) premanifest individuals far (preHD-A; n = 7) or (ii) near 
      (preHD-B; n = 6) to the predicted symptom onset, (iii) manifest HD patients 
      (n = 8), and (iv) controls (n = 36). RESULTS: Cerebral A(1)AR values of preHD-A 
      subjects were generally higher than those of controls (by up to 31%, p < .01, in 
      the thalamus on average). Across stages a successive reduction of A(1)AR BPND was 
      observed to the levels of controls in preHD-B and undercutting controls in 
      manifest HD by down to 25%, p < .01, in the caudatus and amygdala. There was a 
      strong correlation between A(1)AR BP ND and years to onset. Before onset of HD, the 
      assumed annual rates of change of A(1)AR density were -1.2% in the caudatus, -1.7% 
      in the thalamus and -3.4% in the amygdala, while the corresponding volume losses 
      amounted to 0.6%, 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Adenosine receptors 
      switch from supra to subnormal levels during phenoconversion of HD. This 
      differential regulation may play a role in the pathophysiology of altered energy 
      metabolism.

TI  - Serum testosterone levels and androgen receptor CAG polymorphism correlate with 
      hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related acute liver failure in male HBV carriers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Augmentation of androgen/androgen receptor (AR) pathway may influence 
      chronic hepatitis B (CHB) more likely in males. AR activity is modulated by a 
      polymorphic CAG repeat sequence in AR exon 1. This study aimed to investigate the 
      relationship between serum testosterone levels, CAG repeat numbers and hepatitis 
      B virus (HBV)-related acute liver failure (ALF). METHODS: Three hundred and 
      seventy eight male CHB patients with ALF and 441 asymptomatic HBV carriers (AsCs) 
      were recruited. AR CAG repeats numbers were analyzed. The serum testosterone 
      levels of AsCs, ALFs and patients with hepatitis B flare groups, and sequential 
      serum samples, were assessed quantitatively. RESULTS: The median CAG repeat 
      (M-CAG) frequency was significantly higher in ALF patients than AsCs (P<0.001). 
      Patients with M-CAG alleles (P<0.001, OR 3.0, 95% CI 2.1-4.2) had the highest 
      risk for ALF. Serum testosterone levels were significantly higher (P<0.001) at 
      hepatitis flare point (8.2 +/- 3.0 ng/mL) than inactive phase (6.4 +/- 2.0 ng/mL). 
      CHB (8.30 +/- 2.71 ng/mL, P = 7.6 x 10(-6)) and ALF group (2.61 +/- 1.83 ng/mL, P = 
      1.7 x 10(-17)) had significantly different levels of testosterone in comparison 
      with AsCs group (6.56 +/- 2.36 ng/mL). The serum testosterone levels sharply 
      decreased from hepatitis flare phase to liver failure phase, and tended to be 
      normal at the recovery phase. Male AsCs with M-CAG alleles had significantly 
      lower serum testosterone levels (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: There was a serum 
      testosterone fluctuation during hepatitis B flare and HBV-related ALF, and the 
      median CAG repeats in AR gene exon 1 were associated with lower serum 
      testosterone levels in asymptomatic HBV carriers and an increased susceptibility 
      to HBV-related ALF.

TI  - The (CA)n polymorphism of ERbeta gene is associated with FtM transsexualism.
PG  - 720-8
LID - 10.1111/jsm.12398 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Transsexualism is a gender identity disorder with a multifactorial 
      etiology. Neurodevelopmental processes and genetic factors seem to be implicated. 
      AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the possible influence of the sex 
      hormone-related genes ERbeta (estrogen receptor beta), AR (androgen receptor), and 
      CYP19A1 (aromatase) in the etiology of female-to-male (FtM) transsexualism. 
      METHODS: In 273 FtMs and 371 control females, we carried out a molecular analysis 
      of three variable regions: the CA repeats in intron 5 of ERbeta; the CAG repeats in 
      exon 1 of AR, and the TTTA repeats in intron 4 of CYP19A1. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 
      We investigated the possible influence of genotype on transsexualism by 
      performing a molecular analysis of the variable regions of genes ERbeta, AR, and 
      CYP19A1 in 644 individuals (FtMs and control females). RESULTS: FtMs differed 
      significantly from control group with respect to the median repeat length 
      polymorphism ERbeta (P = 0.002) but not with respect to the length of the other two 
      studied polymorphisms. The repeat numbers in ERbeta were significantly higher in 
      FtMs than in control group, and the likelihood of developing transsexualism was 
      higher (odds ratio: 2.001 [1.15-3.46]) in the subjects with the genotype 
      homozygous for long alleles. CONCLUSIONS: There is an association between the ERbeta 
      gene and FtM transsexualism. Our data support the finding that ERbeta function is 
      directly proportional to the size of the analyzed polymorphism, so a greater 
      number of repeats implies greater transcription activation, possibly by 
      increasing the function of the complex hormone ERbeta receptor and thereby 
      encouraging less feminization or a defeminization of the female brain and 
      behavior.

AB  - X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an adult-onset 
      neuromuscular disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the androgen receptor 
      gene. Postural hand tremor is well known as a non-motor neuron sign, but to our 
      knowledge postural leg tremor has not been reported. We studied the occurrence 
      and physiological features of postural leg tremor in 12 male patients (38-64 
      years old) with genetically proven SBMA. Three patients had postural leg tremor 
      with a frequency of 4-7Hz. In these patients, sensory nerve action potential 
      (SNAP) was not detected in the lower limbs. There were significant differences 
      between the patients with postural leg tremor and those without postural leg 
      tremor in both the SNAP of the sural nerve and the length of the CAG repeat. 
      Phenotypical differences between shorter CAG repeats, which indicate a 
      sensory-dominant phenotype, and longer CAG repeats, which indicate a 
      motor-dominant phenotype, have been previously reported. In the present study, 
      60% of patients with shorter CAG repeats (<47) showed leg tremor and none of the 
      patients with longer CAG repeats (>/=47) did. Postural leg tremor could be a 
      clinical feature that predicts shorter CAG repeats of the androgen receptor gene.

AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), Kennedy's disease, is an adult-onset 
      hereditary neurodegenerative disorder, associated predominantly with a lower 
      motor neuron syndrome and eventually endocrine and sensory disturbances. In 
      contrast to other motor neuron diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
      (ALS), the impairment of cognition in SBMA is not well documented. We conducted a 
      systematic cross-sectional neuropsychological study in order to investigate 
      cognition in SBMA patients more thoroughly. We investigated 20 genetically proven 
      SBMA patients compared to 20 age- and education-matched control subjects using a 
      comprehensive neuropsychological test battery, measuring executive functioning, 
      attention, memory and visuospatial abilities. The SBMA patients performed 
      significantly worse than healthy controls in three sub-tests in the executive and 
      attention domains. This low performance was in the working memory (digit span 
      backward task), verbal fluency category (single letter fluency task) and memory 
      storage capacity (digit span forward task). No disturbances were detected in 
      other cognitive domains. The impairments were subclinical and not relevant to the 
      patients' everyday functioning. In addition, no correlations were found between 
      cognitive scores and the CAG repeat length. In conclusion, we found minor 
      cognitive disturbances in patients with SBMA, which could indicate subtle frontal 
      lobe dysfunction. These findings extend our neurobiological understanding of 
      SBMA.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate possible cerebral involvement in patients with spinal 
      and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) by (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission 
      tomography (FDG-PET). DESIGN: Ten patients with molecularly-confirmed SBMA and 5 
      age- and gender-matched healthy controls were recruited for brain FDG-PET 
      studies. The data were analyzed and compared using the statistical parametric 
      mapping (SPM) method. RESULTS: Glucose hypometabolism in frontal areas of the 
      cerebrum was found in patients with SBMA. However, no significant correlation 
      with clinical variables, such as CAG repeat length, age at onset, or serum 
      testosterone levels, was noted. CONCLUSIONS: The perturbation of cerebral glucose 
      metabolism in patients with SBMA argues against SBMA being a pure lower motor and 
      sensory neuron syndrome. Mutations in the androgen receptor gene might have a 
      more widespread effect in the cerebrum than previously recognized.

PG  - e75709

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) refers to an inheritable androgen 
      excess disorder characterized by multiple small follicles located at the ovarian 
      periphery. Hyperandrogenism in PCOS, and inverse correlation between androgen 
      receptor (AR) CAG numbers and AR function, led us to hypothesize that CAG length 
      variations may affect PCOS risk. METHODS: CAG repeat region of 169 patients 
      recruited following strictly defined Rotterdam (2003) inclusion criteria and that 
      of 175 ethnically similar control samples, were analyzed. We also conducted a 
      meta-analysis on the data taken from published studies, to generate a pooled 
      estimate on 2194 cases and 2242 controls. RESULTS: CAG bi-allelic mean length was 
      between 8.5 and 24.5 (mean = 17.43, SD = 2.43) repeats in the controls and 
      between 11 and 24 (mean = 17.39, SD = 2.29) repeats in the cases, without any 
      significant difference between the two groups. Further, comparison of bi-allelic 
      mean and its frequency distribution in three categories (short, moderate and long 
      alleles) did not show any significant difference between controls and various 
      case subgroups. Frequency distribution of bi-allelic mean in two categories 
      (extreme and moderate alleles) showed over-representation of extreme sized 
      alleles in the cases with marginally significant value (50.3% vs. 61.5%, 
      chi(2) = 4.41; P = 0.036), which turned insignificant upon applying Bonferroni 
      correction for multiple comparisons. X-chromosome inactivation analysis showed no 
      significant difference in the inactivation pattern of CAG alleles or in the 
      comparison of weighed bi-allelic mean between cases and controls. Meta-analysis 
      also showed no significant correlation between CAG length and PCOS risk, except a 
      minor over-representation of short CAG alleles in the cases. CONCLUSION: CAG 
      bi-allelic mean length did not differ between controls and cases/case sub-groups 
      nor did the allele distribution. Over-representation of short/extreme-sized 
      alleles in the cases may be a chance finding without any true association with 
      PCOS risk.

AB  - Trinucleotide repeat disorders are a heterogeneous group of diseases caused by 
      the expansion, beyond a pathogenic threshold, of unstable DNA tracts in different 
      genes. Sequence interruptions in the repeats have been described in the majority 
      of these disorders and may influence disease phenotype and heritability. Spinal 
      bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a motor neuron disease caused by a CAG 
      trinucleotide expansion in the androgen receptor (AR) gene. Diagnostic testing 
      and previous research have relied on fragment analysis polymerase chain reaction 
      to determine the AR CAG repeat size, and have therefore not been able to assess 
      the presence of interruptions. We here report a sequencing study of the AR CAG 
      repeat in a cohort of SBMA patients and control subjects in the United Kingdom. 
      We found no repeat interruptions to be present, and we describe differences 
      between sequencing and traditional sizing methods.

TI  - Expansion of memory-type CD8+ T cells correlates with the failure of early 
      immunosuppression withdrawal after cadaver liver transplantation using high-dose 
      ATG induction and rapamycin.
PG  - 306-15
LID - 10.1097/TP.0b013e3182985414 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We report on a pilot study investigating the feasibility of early 
      immunosuppression withdrawal after liver transplantation (LT) using antithymocyte 
      globulin (ATG) induction and rapamycin. METHODS: LT recipients received 3.75 
      mg/kg per day ATG from days 0 to 5 followed by rapamycin-based immunosuppression. 
      In the absence of acute rejection (AR), rapamycin was withdrawn after month 4. 
      Immunomonitoring included analysis of peripheral T-cell phenotypes and clonality, 
      cytokine production in mixed lymphocyte reaction, and characterization of 
      intragraft infiltrating cells. RESULTS: Ten patients were enrolled between 
      October 2009 and July 2010. In the first three patients, complete withdrawal of 
      immunosuppression after month 4 led to AR. No further withdrawals of 
      immunosuppressive were attempted. Two AR occurred in the remaining seven 
      patients. ATG induced profound T-cell depletion followed by CD8(+) T-cell 
      reexpansion exhibiting memory/effector-like phenotype associated with progressive 
      oligoclonal T-cell expansion (Vbeta/HPRT ratio) and gradually enhanced 
      anti-cytomegalovirus and anti-Epstein-Barr virus T-cell frequencies. Patients 
      developing AR were characterized by decreased TCAIM expression. AR were 
      associated with increased donor-specific production of interferon (IFN)-gamma and 
      interleukin (IL)-17, increased intragraft expression of IFN-gamma mRNA, and 
      significant CD8(+) T-cell infiltrates colocalizing with IL-17(+) cells. 
      CONCLUSION: High-dose ATG followed by short-term rapamycin treatment failed to 
      promote early operational tolerance to LT. AR correlates with expansion of 
      memory-type CD8(+) T cells and increased levels of IFN-gamma and IL-17 in mixed 
      lymphocyte reaction and in the graft. This suggests that resistance and 
      preferential expansion of effector memory T-cell in lymphopenic environment could 
      represent the major barrier for establishment of tolerance to LT in approaches 
      using T-cell-depleting induction.

TI  - Is the Expression of Androgen Receptor Protein Associated With the Length of AC 
      Repeats in the Type III 5-alpha Reductase Gene in Prostate Cancer Patients?
PG  - 404-8
LID - 10.4111/kju.2013.54.6.404 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Type III 5-alpha reductase (SRD5A3; steroid 5-alpha reductase 3) may be 
      associated with the progression of prostate cancer (PCa). The aim of our study 
      was to determine whether the length of AC repeats in the SRD5A3 gene is 
      associated with the risk of PCa and the expression of androgen receptor (AR) 
      protein in Korean men. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared the length of AC 
      repeats in the short tandem repeat (STR) region of the SRD5A3 gene in 68 PCa 
      patients and 81 control subjects by genotyping. A total of 55 patients in the PCa 
      group underwent radical prostatectomy. We evaluated the expression of AR protein 
      by using Western blotting and tested the association between the type of AC 
      repeats in the SRD5A3 gene and AR protein expression and clinical and pathologic 
      parameters. RESULTS: The short type of STR had less than 21 copies of AC repeats 
      in the SRD5A3 gene. The SS type (short and short type) of STR of the SRD5A3 gene 
      was 2.2 times as likely to occur in PCa patients as in controls (odds ratio, 
      2.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.14 to 4.31; p=0.019). However, AC repeats of the 
      SRD5A3 gene were not associated with AR protein expression or clinical or 
      pathologic parameters in PCa samples. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the 
      short AC repeats of SRD5A3 polymorphism are associated with an increased risk of 
      PCa. SRD5A3 polymorphism may contribute to a genetic predisposition for PCa.

AB  - Habitual consumption of caffeine, a non-selective adenosine receptor (AR) 
      antagonist, has been suggested to be beneficial in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's 
      diseases. Experimental evidence support that ARs play a role in Huntington's 
      disease (HD) raising the hypothesis that caffeine may be a life-style modifier in 
      HD. To determine a possible relationship between caffeine consumption and age at 
      onset (AAO) in HD, we retrospectively assessed caffeine consumption in 80 HD 
      patients using a dietary survey and determined relationship with AAO. Following 
      adjustment for gender, smoking status and CAG repeat length, caffeine consumption 
      greater than 190mg/day was significantly associated with an earlier AAO. These 
      data support an association between habitual caffeine intake and AAO in HD 
      patients, but further studies are warranted to understand the link between these 
      variables.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a lower motor neuron 
      disease caused by a CAG repeat expansion within the androgen receptor (AR) gene. 
      Toxic nuclear accumulation of mutant AR has been observed in tissues other than 
      nervous system including cardiac muscle. Moreover, CAG polymorphism length within 
      AR has been associated with an increased risk of heart disease. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: To test the hypothesis of the presence of cardiomyopathy in SBMA, a full 
      cardiac protocol was applied to 25 SBMA patients. RESULTS: Patients' age ranged 
      between 32 and 75 years. Cardiologic examination, 12-lead ECG, and 
      echocardiography showed no abnormalities other than those consistent with 
      hypertensive heart disease. One patient showed frequent supraventricular 
      premature beats in absence of other significant arrhythmias at the 24-h ECG 
      Holter. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not support the hypothesis of a primary 
      cardiomyopathy in SBMA.

AB  - Women are at a 2-fold risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
      (onset at 65 years of age or older) compared with men. During perimenopausal 
      years, women undergo hormonal changes that are accompanied by metabolic, 
      cardiovascular, and inflammatory changes. These all together have been suggested 
      as risk factors for late-onset AD. However, not all perimenopausal women develop 
      AD; we hypothesize that certain genetic factors might underlie the increased 
      susceptibility for developing AD in postmenopausal women. We investigated the 
      Androgen Receptor gene (AR) in a clinical cohort of male and female AD patients 
      and normal control subjects by sequencing all coding exons and evaluating the 
      length and distribution of the CAG repeat in exon 1. We could not establish a 
      correlation between the repeat length, sex, and the disease status, nor did we 
      identify possible pathogenic variants. AR is located on the X chromosome; to 
      assess its role in AD, X-inactivation patterns will need to be studied to 
      directly correlate the actual expressed repeat length to a possible sex-specific 
      phenotypic effect.

TI  - Convenient diagnosis of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy using a microchip 
      electrophoresis system.
PG  - 35-9
AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a slowly progressive motor neuron 
      disease. Lower and primary sensory neuronopathy is one of the major 
      neuropathological changes that occurs in SBMA. However, many sings are common to 
      SBMA and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and SBMA patients are sometimes 
      diagnosed with ALS. Leuprorelin may be used to treat SBMA, but an accurate 
      diagnosis is necessary for treatment and care. Genetic diagnosis can be performed 
      to detect the expansion of a CAG repeat in the androgen receptor gene in SBMA 
      patients. To screen for this expansion, we used a microchip electrophoresis 
      system. The discrepancy between the actual repeat length and that found by the 
      microchip electrophoresis system was roughly dependent on the repeat length. The 
      mean difference was -6.8 base pairs (bp) in SBMA patients, -0.30 bp in controls. 
      The microchip electrophoresis results were approximately 2 CAG repeats shorter 
      than the actual repeat length in SBMA patients. Using this method, we screened 
      our ALS samples (31 were familial, 271 were sporadic): 4 subjects were diagnosed 
      with SBMA; 2 had familial ALS, and 2 had sporadic ALS (0.7%). The microchip 
      electrophoresis system is semi-quantitative, convenient and useful for screening 
      a large number of samples.

      susceptibility.
PG  - 180-96

AB  - Variation in polyglutamine repeat number in the androgen receptor (AR CAGn) is 
      negatively correlated with the transcription of androgen-responsive genes and is 
      associated with susceptibility to an extensive list of human disease. Only a 
      small portion of the heritability for many of these diseases is explained by 
      conventional SNP-based genome-wide association studies, and the forces shaping AR 
      CAGn among humans remains largely unexplored. Here, we propose evolutionary 
      models for understanding selection at the AR CAG locus, namely balancing 
      selection, sexual conflict, accumulation-selection, and antagonistic pleiotropy. 
      We evaluate these models by examining AR CAGn-linked susceptibility to eight 
      extensively studied diseases representing the diverse physiological roles of 
      androgens, and consider the costs of these diseases by their frequency and 
      fitness effects. Five diseases could contribute to the distribution of AR CAGn 
      observed among contemporary human populations. With support for disease 
      susceptibilities associated with long and short AR CAGn, balancing selection 
      provides a useful model for studying selection at this locus. Gender-specific 
      differences AR CAGn health effects also support this locus as a candidate for 
      sexual conflict over repeat number. Accompanied by the accumulation of AR CAGn in 
      humans, these models help explain the distribution of repeat number in 
      contemporary human populations.

AB  - AIM: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic rheumatic disorder with gender 
      differences. The aim of study was to investigate the association between 
      polymorphisms of the androgen receptor (AR) gene and the susceptibility to AS in 
      Taiwanese men of Han Chinese descent. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study 
      with 92 male AS patients and 108 healthy controls. Trinucleotide (CAG and GGC) 
      repeats and seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs962458, rs6152, 
      rs1204038, rs5918757, rs2361634, rs6624304 and rs1337080 in the AR gene were 
      genotyped. RESULTS: We found that only one patient had polymorphic SNPs of the AR 
      gene. None of the genotyped SNPs in the AR gene, originally found in Caucasians, 
      was polymorphic in the Taiwanese men. Neither CAG nor GGC repeat lengths in the 
      AR gene had a significant relationship with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 
      positivity or disease severity in AS. CONCLUSION: There were no differences in 
      CAG and GGC lengths in the AR gene between AS and the controls. None of the 
      genotyped SNPs in AR gene are detected to be polymorphic in male Taiwanese, which 
      indicates that the effect of AR gene on AS may be ethnic-specific and may be 
      conserved in East Asians compared to Caucasian populations. Still, additional 
      studies using large sets of subjects deserve further attention, since our sample 
      size was small with limited statistical power and supporting evidence for 
      association between the AR gene and AS risk in the Japanese population exists.

TI  - Androgen receptor (CAG)n polymorphism and androgen levels in women with systemic

AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder that affects mainly 
      females. Therefore, interrelations between the reproductive and immune system 
      have been assumed. Considering the complex influence of hormones and receptors, 
      we aimed to investigate the influence of androgens and androgen receptor (AR) 
      polymorphism in women with SLE. One hundred and sixteen patients and 44 healthy 
      women were investigated. Testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), 
      dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate (DHEAS) concentrations and AR (CAG)n polymorphism 
      were determined. SLE patients had significantly lower levels of total and free 
      testosterone and DHEAS in comparison with the controls. No differences in the CAG 
      repeat length between the groups were established. Women with two alleles 
      carrying more than 22 CAG repeats had significantly higher levels of SHBG (101.51 
      +/- 61.81 vs. 69.22 +/- 45.93 nmol/l, p = 0.015) and DHEAS (3.11 +/- 2.65 vs. 2.11 +/- 
      3.06 mumol/l, p = 0.007) and a tendency to higher testosterone concentrations 
      (2.35 +/- 2.10 vs. 1.71 +/- 1.70 nmol/l, p = 0.056) in comparison with other women. 
      The CAG repeat length in the relatively longer (CAG)n allele was inversely 
      related to the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/ACR index (r = 
      -0.258, p = 0.009). In conclusion, the androgen receptor (CAG)n polymorphism is 
      not related to the development of SLE, but it could modulate the severity of the 
      lupus chronic damages as well as the androgen levels in women.

TI  - Making sense of intratumor genetic heterogeneity: altered frequency of androgen 
      receptor CAG repeat length variants in breast cancer tissues.
PG  - 610-8
LID - 10.1002/humu.22287 [doi]
AB  - To examine the significance of intratumor genetic heterogeneity (ITGH) of the 
      androgen receptor (AR) gene in breast cancer, patient-matched samples of laser 
      capture microdissected breast tumor cells, adjacent normal breast epithelia 
      cells, and peripheral blood leukocytes were sequenced using a novel next 
      generation sequencing protocol. This protocol measured the frequency of 
      distribution of a variable AR CAG repeat length, a functional polymorphism 
      associated with breast cancer risk. All samples exhibited some degree of ITGH 
      with up to 30 CAG repeat length variants identified. Each type of tissue 
      exhibited a different distribution profile of CAG repeat lengths with substantial 
      differences in the frequencies of zero and 18-25 CAG AR variants. Tissue 
      differences in the frequency of ARs with each of these CAG repeat lengths were 
      significant as measured by paired, twin t-tests. These results suggest that 
      preferential selection of 18-25 CAG repeat length variants in breast tumors may 
      be associated with breast cancer, and support the observation that shorter CAG 
      repeats may protect against breast cancer. They also suggest that merely 
      identifying variant genes will be insufficient to determine the critical 
      mutational events of oncogenesis, which will require measuring the frequency of 
      distribution of mutations within cancerous and matching normal tissues.

AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an X-linked motor neuron disease 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the androgen receptor (AR) gene. 
      Ligand-dependent nuclear accumulation of mutant AR protein is a critical 
      characteristic of the pathogenesis of SBMA. SBMA has been modeled in 
      AR-overexpressing animals, but precisely how the polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion 
      leads to neurodegeneration is unclear. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are 
      a new technology that can be used to model human diseases, study pathogenic 
      mechanisms, and develop novel drugs. We established SBMA patient-derived iPSCs, 
      investigated their cellular biochemical characteristics, and found that 
      SBMA-iPSCs can differentiate into motor neurons. The CAG repeat numbers in the AR 
      gene of SBMA-iPSCs and also in the atrophin-1 gene of iPSCs derived from another 
      polyQ disease, dentato-rubro-pallido-luysian atrophy (DRPLA), remain unchanged 
      during reprogramming, long term passage, and differentiation, indicating that 
      polyQ disease-associated CAG repeats are stable during maintenance of iPSCs. The 
      level of AR expression is up-regulated by neuronal differentiation and treatment 
      with the AR ligand dihydrotestosterone. Filter retardation assays indicated that 
      aggregation of ARs following dihydrotestosterone treatment in neurons derived 
      from SBMA-iPSCs increases significantly compared with neurological control iPSCs, 
      easily recapitulating the pathological feature of mutant ARs in SBMA-iPSCs. This 
      phenomenon was not observed in iPSCs and fibroblasts, thereby showing the 
      neuron-dominant phenotype of this disease. Furthermore, the HSP90 inhibitor 
      17-allylaminogeldanamycin sharply decreased the level of aggregated AR in neurons 
      derived from SBMA-iPSCs, indicating a potential for discovery and validation of 
      candidate drugs. We found that SBMA-iPSCs possess disease-specific biochemical 
      features and could thus open new avenues of research into not only SBMA, but also 
      other polyglutamine diseases.

AB  - Although most advanced prostate cancer patients respond to androgen-deprivation 
      therapy (ADT), the efficacy is widely variable. We investigated whether the host 
      genetic variations in sex hormone pathway genes are associated with the efficacy 
      of ADT. A cohort of 645 patients with advanced prostate cancer treated with ADT 
      was genotyped for 18 polymorphisms across 12 key genes involved in androgen and 
      estrogen metabolism. We found that after adjusting for known risk factors in 
      multivariate Cox regression models, AKR1C3 rs12529 and AR-CAG repeat length 
      remained significantly associated with prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) 
      after ADT (P </= 0.041). Furthermore, individuals carrying two unfavorable 
      genotypes at these loci presented a 13.7-fold increased risk of PCSM compared 
      with individuals carrying zero (P<0.001). Our results identify two candidate 
      molecular markers in key genes of androgen and estrogen pathways associated with 
      PCSM after ADT, establishing the role of pharmacogenomics in this therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The androgen receptor (AR) expression and the CAG repeat length 
      within the AR gene appear to be involved in the carcinogenesis of male breast 
      carcinoma (MBC). Although phenotypic differences have been observed between MBC 
      and normal control group in AR gene, there is lack of correlation analysis 
      between AR expression and CAG repeat length in MBC. The purpose of the study was 
      to investigate the prognostic value of CAG repeat lengths and AR protein 
      expression. METHODS: 81 tumor tissues were used for immunostaining for AR 
      expression and CAG repeat length determination and 80 normal controls were 
      analyzed with CAG repeat length in AR gene. The CAG repeat length and AR 
      expression were analyzed in relation to clinicopathological factors and 
      prognostic indicators. RESULTS: AR gene in many MBCs has long CAG repeat sequence 
      compared with that in control group (P = 0.001) and controls are more likely to 
      exhibit short CAG repeat sequence than MBCs. There was statistically significant 
      difference in long CAG repeat sequence between AR status for MBC patients 
      (P = 0.004). The presence of long CAG repeat sequence and AR-positive expression 
      were associated with shorter survival of MBC patients (CAG repeat: P = 0.050 for 
      5y-OS; P = 0.035 for 5y-DFS AR status: P = 0.048 for 5y-OS; P = 0.029 for 5y-DFS, 
      respectively). CONCLUSION: The CAG repeat length within the AR gene might be one 
      useful molecular biomarker to identify males at increased risk of breast cancer 
      development. The presence of long CAG repeat sequence and AR protein expression 
      were in relation to survival of MBC patients. The CAG repeat length and AR 
      expression were two independent prognostic indicators in MBC patients.

AB  - Polymorphic GGC repeats in the androgen receptor (AR) gene can alter 
      transactivation of androgen-responsive genes and increase the risk of benign 
      prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer (PCa). We investigated the 
      association between GGC repeat length, testosterone levels and the risk of 
      developing PCa and BPH in a population from southern Brazil. A sample comprising 
      130 PCa, 126 BPH and 88 control patients was evaluated. DNA was extracted from 
      leukocytes and the AR gene was analyzed by fragment analysis. The hazard ratio 
      (HR) was estimated. GGC mean length was not different between the three study 
      groups. The risk of developing PCa in individuals with GGC > 19 was 3.300 (95 %CI 
      1.385-7.874) higher when compared to the GGC </= 19 group (p = 0.007). The risk of 
      developing PCa and BPH in individuals with total testosterone levels <4 ng/mL was 
      2.799 (95 % CI 1.362-5.754). (p = 0.005) and 2.786 (95 % CI 1.470-5.280) (p = 
      0.002), respectively. Total testosterone levels in patients with GGC > 19 were 
      significantly lower when compared to patients in the GGC </= 19 group. Our data 
      suggest that the presence of a high number of polymorphic GGC repeats in the AR 
      gene is associated with an increased risk of developing PCa and BPH, and that 
      lower testosterone levels also increase the risk of developing these diseases.

TI  - The CAG repeat polymorphism in the androgen receptor gene modifies the risk for 
      hypospadias in Caucasians.
PG  - 109
LID - 10.1186/1471-2350-13-109 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypospadias is a birth defect of the urethra in males, and a milder 
      form of 46,XY disorder of sexual development (DSD). The disease is characterized 
      by a ventrally placed urinary opening due to a premature fetal arrest of the 
      urethra development. Moreover, the Androgen receptor (AR) gene has an essential 
      role in the hormone-dependent stage of sexual development. In addition, longer AR 
      polyglutamine repeat lengths encoded by CAG repeats are associated with lower 
      transcriptional activity in vitro. In the present study, we aimed at 
      investigating the role of the CAG repeat length in the AR gene in hypospadias 
      cases as compared to the controls. Our study included 211 hypospadias and 208 
      controls of Caucasian origin. METHODS: We amplified the CAG repeat region with 
      PCR, and calculated the difference in the mean CAG repeat length between the 
      hypospadias and control group using the T-test for independent groups. RESULTS: 
      We detected a significant increase of the CAG repeat length in the hypospadias 
      cases when compared to the controls (contrast estimate: 2.29, 95% Confidence 
      Interval (1.73-2.84); p-value: 0.001). In addition, the odds ratios between the 
      hypospadias and controls revealed that the hypospadias cases are two to 3 times 
      as likely to have longer CAG repeats than a shorter length for each repeat length 
      investigated. CONCLUSIONS: We have investigated the largest number of hypospadias 
      cases with regards to the CAG repeat length, and we provide evidence that a 
      higher number of the CAG repeat sequence in the AR gene have a clear effect on 
      the risk of hypospadias in Caucasians.

TI  - Lack of Influence of the Androgen Receptor Gene CAG-Repeat Polymorphism on 
      Clinical and Electrocardiographic Manifestations of the Brugada Syndrome in Man.
PG  - 145-52
LID - 10.4137/CMC.S10553 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical studies suggest that testosterone (T) plays an important 
      role in the male predominance of the clinical manifestations of the Brugada 
      syndrome (BS). However, no statistically significant correlations have been 
      observed between T levels and electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters in the BS 
      patients. We investigated whether the hormonal pattern and the variation within 
      CAG repeat polymorphism in exon 1 of the androgen receptor (AR) gene, affecting 
      androgen sensitivity, are associated with the Brugada ECG phenotype in males. 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: 16 male patients with BS (mean age 45.06 +/- 11.3 years) were 
      studied. 12-lead ECG was recorded. Blood levels of follicle-stimulating hormone, 
      luteinizing hormone, prolactin, testosterone, free-T, dihydrotestosterone, 
      17-beta-estradiol, estrone, 3-alpha-androstanediol-glucuronide, 
      delta-4-androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, progesterone, 
      17-hydroxyprogesterone, and sex hormone binding globulin were assayed. Genotyping 
      of CAG repeats on DNA extracted from leukocytes was carried out. No relationship 
      was found between hormone values and ECG parameters of BS. BS patients showed the 
      CAG length normally recognized in the human polymorphism range and the number of 
      CAG repeats did not correlate with the ECG pattern of BS. CONCLUSIONS: The AR CAG 
      repeat length does not correlate with the ECG features of the patients affected 
      by BS. The search for genes downstream AR activation as possibly responsible for 
      the increased risk of spontaneous arrhythmias in BS males after puberty is 
      warranted.

AB  - Spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are two 
      distinct forms of motor neuron disease with different genetic causes, pathology, 
      and clinical course. However, both disorders are characterized by the progressive 
      loss of lower motor neurons and by a similar protective response to growth 
      factors in animal models, therefore raising the possibility of an overlap in the 
      final pathogenic cascade. Mutations in the FUS gene and fused in sarcoma (FUS) 
      protein pathology have now been identified in some amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
      cases, while a CAG expansion in the androgen receptor gene is known to cause 
      SBMA. Recently, multiple lines of evidence have identified FUS as a major target 
      of the androgen receptor, suggesting that FUS could be dysregulated in SBMA motor 
      neurons. We have investigated this possibility by using a well-established mouse 
      model of SBMA and our analysis of primary motor neuron cultures, spinal cords, 
      and microdissected motor neurons show no evidence for FUS dysregulation.

PG  - 692-7
LID - 10.1002/mus.23413 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an adult-onset motor 
      neuron disease caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the androgen receptor gene. 
      The aim of this study was to verify whether urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine 
      (8-OHdG), an oxidative stress marker, is a biomarker for SBMA. METHODS: We 
      measured the levels of urinary 8-OHdG in 33 genetically confirmed SBMA patients 
      and 32 age-matched controls over a 24-month period at 6-month intervals. RESULTS: 
      Urinary 8-OHdG levels in SBMA patients were significantly elevated compared with 
      those of controls and correlated well with motor function scores. During the 
      follow-up period, urinary 8-OHdG levels increased and correlated with motor 
      function at each time-point. In addition, urinary 8-OHdG levels at baseline were 
      correlated with changes in the 6-minute walk test during 24 months. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Urinary 8-OHdG is a biomarker for SBMA, reflecting the severity and possibly 
      predicting the deterioration of motor function.

TI  - The androgen receptor facilitates inhibition of human dopamine transporter (DAT1) 
      reporter gene expression by HESR1 and HESR2 via the variable number of tandem 
      repeats.
PG  - 54-9
LID - 10.1016/j.neulet.2012.07.021 [doi]
AB  - A functional genetic polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) within exon 
      15 of the human DAT gene (DAT1) has been described. This 3'-UTR contains a 
      variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) 40 bp in length; many association 
      studies of psychiatric or developmental disorders with this VNTR have been 
      conducted. We previously demonstrated that HESR1 (the Hairy/enhancer of split 
      related transcriptional factor 1 with YRPW motif) and HESR2 reduced DAT reporter 
      gene expression via this 3'-UTR. VNTR allele-dependent altered reporter gene 
      expression was also observed. In the present study, we wanted to clarify the 
      molecular characterization of HESR1 and HESR2, focusing on its cis-element and 
      co-factor. Deletion of the VNTR domain increased reporter gene expression both 
      with and without transfection of HESRs, suggesting that the VNTR inhibits DAT 
      expression, and is responsive to HESRs. In the presence of transfected androgen 
      receptor (AR), activity of the luciferase reporter with the nine-repeat allele 
      (9r) decreased, while that with the ten-repeat allele (10r), the most frequent in 
      the population, increased significantly. Furthermore, co-expression of HESR1 or 
      HESR2 with AR increased the inhibitory effect of the HESRs. Our data indicate 
      that a functional modification occurs when the HESRs are coupled with AR. This 
      HESR-AR interaction could be the molecular basis of sexual dimorphisms in DAT 
      expression, or other dopamine-related behavioral traits.

AB  - Genetic variants in hormone receptor genes may be crucial predisposing factors 
      for breast cancer, and microsatellites in the estrogen receptor (ESR1, ESR2) and 
      androgen receptor (AR) genes have been suggested to play a role. We studied 258 
      African-American (AA) women with breast cancer and 259 hospital-based controls, 
      as well as 349 Nigerian (NG) female breast cancer patients and 296 community 
      controls. Three microsatellites, ESR1_TA, ESR2_CA and AR_CAG, in the ESR1, ESR2 
      and AR genes, respectively, were genotyped. Their repeat lengths were then 
      analyzed as continuous and dichotomous variables. Analyses of continuous 
      variables showed no association with breast cancer risk in either AA or NG at 
      ESR1_TA; AA cases had shorter repeats in the long allele of ESR2_CA than AA 
      controls (Mann-Whitney P= 0.036; logistic regression P = 0.04, OR= 0.91, 95% CI 
      0.83-1.00), whereas NG patients had longer repeats in the short allele than NG 
      controls (Mann-Whitney P= 0.0018; logistic regression P= 0.04, OR= 1.06, 95% CI 
      1.00-1.11); and AA cases carried longer repeats in the short allele of AR_CAG 
      than AA controls (Mann-Whitney P= 0.038; logistic regression P = 0.03, OR= 1.08, 
      95% CI 1.01-1.15). When allele sizes were categorized as dichotomous variables, 
      we discovered that women with two long alleles of ESR2_CA had increased risk of 
      breast cancer (OR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.10-1.74; P = 0.006). This is the first study 
      to investigate these three microsatellites in hormonal receptor genes in relation 
      to breast cancer risk in an indigenous African population. After adjusting for 
      multiple-testing, our findings suggest that ESR2_CA is associated with breast 
      cancer risk in Nigerian women, whereas ESR1_TA and AR_CAG seem to have no 
      association with the disease among African American or Nigerian women.

TI  - Androgen receptor CAG polymorphism and the risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia 
      in a Brazilian population.
PG  - 373-9
AB  - Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a very frequent age-related proliferative 
      abnormality in men. Polymorphic CAG repeat in the androgen receptor (AR) can 
      alter transactivation of androgen-responsive genes and potentially influence BPH 
      risk. We investigated the association between CAG repeat length and risk of BPH 
      in a case-control study of a Brazilian population. We evaluated 214 patients; 126 
      with BPH and 88 healthy controls. DNA was extracted from peripheral leucocytes 
      and the AR gene was analyzed using fragment analysis. Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% 
      confidence interval were estimated using logistic regression models. Mean CAG 
      length was not different between patients with BPH and controls. The CAG repeat 
      length was examined as a categorical variable (CAG </= 21 vs. CAG > 21 and CAG </= 22 
      vs. CAG > 22) and did not differ between the control vs. the BPH group. We found 
      no evidence for an association between AR CAG repeat length in BPH risk in a 
      population-based sample of Brazilians.

TI  - A polyglutamine expansion disease protein sequesters PTIP to attenuate DNA repair 
      and increase genomic instability.
PG  - 4225-36
LID - 10.1093/hmg/dds246 [doi]
AB  - Glutamine (Q) expansion diseases are a family of degenerative disorders caused by 
      the lengthening of CAG triplet repeats present in the coding sequences of 
      seemingly unrelated genes whose mutant proteins drive pathogenesis. Despite all 
      the molecular evidence for the genetic basis of these diseases, how mutant poly-Q 
      proteins promote cell death and drive pathogenesis remains controversial. In this 
      report, we show a specific interaction between the mutant androgen receptor (AR), 
      a protein associated with spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), and the 
      nuclear protein PTIP (Pax Transactivation-domain Interacting Protein), a protein 
      with an unusually long Q-rich domain that functions in DNA repair. Upon exposure 
      to ionizing radiation, PTIP localizes to nuclear foci that are sites of DNA 
      damage and repair. However, the expression of poly-Q AR sequesters PTIP away from 
      radiation-induced nuclear foci. This results in sensitivity to DNA-damaging 
      agents and chromosomal instabilities. In a mouse model of SBMA, evidence for DNA 
      damage is detected in muscle cell nuclei and muscular atrophy is accelerated when 
      one copy of the gene encoding PTIP is removed. These data provide a new paradigm 
      for understanding the mechanisms of cellular degeneration observed in poly-Q 
      expansion diseases.

TI  - Association of androgen receptor, prostate-specific antigen, and CYP19 gene 
      polymorphisms with prostate carcinoma and benign prostatic hyperplasia in a north 
      Indian population.
PG  - 835-40
LID - 10.1089/gtmb.2011.0322 [doi]
AB  - The genes involved in androgen pathway and metabolism have been reported to 
      contribute considerably to prostate carcinoma (CaP) risk. The present study 
      investigated the association of androgen receptor (AR), prostate-specific antigen 
      (PSA or KLK3), and cytochrome P450 (CYP19) gene polymorphisms in CaP (n=105) and 
      benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (n=120) in comparison to normal healthy 
      controls (n=106) in an Indian population. We also evaluated the functional 
      consequences of these gene variants on AR and PSA mRNA expression. Significant 
      association of short AR CAG repeats (</=24) with risk of CaP (odds ratios 
      [OR]=2.98, p<0.001) and BPH (OR=1.96, p=0.01) was observed; however, CYP19 gene 
      polymorphism was not found to be associated with disease phenotype (p>0.05). PSA 
      G-158A SNP was found to be significantly associated with risk of CaP (AA: 
      OR=2.68, p=0.016 and GA: OR=2.07, p=0.018) p-trend 0.031 and BPH (AA: OR=3.46, 
      p<0.001 and GA: OR=2.47, p=0.03) p-trend 0.009, respectively. PSA G-158A genotype 
      independently increased the risk of developing BPH (OR=16.37, p<0.001), 
      irrespective of AR CAG repeat length. Using quantitative real-time polymerase 
      chain reaction, we found a significant upregulation of AR and PSA mRNA expression 
      in CaP comparison to BPH. While short AR CAG (</=24) repeats were associated with 
      higher AR mRNA expression in CaP (p=0.002), the PSA SNP did not correlate with 
      its mRNA expression. Interestingly, significantly higher risk estimates for CaP 
      were observed for the combined analysis of short AR CAG and CYP19 genotypes 
      (A2A2) (OR=7.18, p<0.001) or A2A3 (OR=7.60, p=0.004). Our results suggest 
      significant association of androgen signaling gene polymorphisms with risk of CaP 
      and BPH and provide evidence for a putative functional role of AR CAG repeat in 
      regulating its mRNA expression and warrant the need of larger studies in the 
      Indian population to confirm our results.

AB  - The number of trinucleotide repeats [CAG (coding for polyglutamine), GGC (coding 
      for polyglycine)] in the first exon of the androgen receptor (AR) gene and 
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) gene androgen response element I A/G polymorphism 
      are both related to prostate cancer prognosis. We investigated whether these 
      genomic changes occur in the AR and PSA genes, which are usually found in 
      individuals with prostate cancer, of Turkish patients and to find out their 
      distribution in the population. We used PCR and PCR-RFLP assays for AR and PSA 
      genes, respectively, to detect molecular changes in 44 prostate cancer patients. 
      Our findings indicate that individuals with prostate cancer tend to have around 
      18 CAG trinucleotide repeats. We observed significant differences between 22 
      controls, 33 benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) patients and 44 adenocarcinoma 
      patients for long CAG repeats. However, we did not find any significant 
      differences in GGC repeats between controls, BPH and adenocarcinoma patients (P = 
      0.408). We also did not observe significant differences in the PSA A/G 
      polymorphism frequency between controls, BPH and adenocarcinoma patients (P = 
      0.483). In conclusion, CAG and GGC repeats in the AR and PSA gene polymorphisms 
      may be associated with prostate cancer risk and BPH in the Turkish population.

      regarding their hearing quality and middle ear function. Nine of them presented 
      middle ear dysfunction (MED) and nine presented normal function (NF) before rapid 
      maxillary expansion. Audiometric and tympanometric exams were taken before rapid 
      maxillary expansion, after RME (15 days), 3 months and one year after rapid 
      maxillary expansion. RESULTS: Among those in the MED group, no patient had 
      acoustic reflex (AR) before rapid maxillary expansion; 67% presented type C 
      tympanometric curve, 22% had type A and 11% had As type tympanometric curve. One 
      year after rapid maxillary expansion, all patients presented AR and showed type A 
      tympanometric curves. In NF group, all patients showed AR and type A 
      tympanometric curves in all records. In both groups no audiograms presented 
      significant variations along study. CONCLUSION: Rapid maxillary expansion has no 
      deleterious effect in hearing quality and seems to improve middle ear function in 
      children with posterior cross-bite in a one-year perspective.

TI  - CAG Repeat Number in the Androgen Receptor Gene and Prostate Cancer.
PG  - 31-6
LID - 10.2478/v10034-012-0005-z [doi]
AB  - Prostate cancer (PC) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in men. The 
      effects of androgens on prostatic tissue are mediated by the androgen receptor 
      (AR) gene. The 5' end of exon 1 of the AR gene includes a polymorphic CAG triplet 
      repeat that numbers between 10 to 36 in the normal population. The length of the 
      CAG repeats is inversely related to the transactivation function of the AR gene. 
      There is controversy over association between short CAG repeat numbers in the AR 
      gene and PC. This retrospective case-control study evaluates the possible effect 
      of short CAG repeats on the AR gene in prostate cancer risk in Macedonian males. 
      A total of 392 male subjects, 134 PC patients, 106 patients with benign prostatic 
      hyperplasia (BPH) and 152 males from the general Macedonian population were 
      enrolled in this study. The CAG repeat length was determined by fluorescent 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of exon1 of the AR gene followed by 
      capillary electrophoresis (CE) on a genetic analyzer. The mean repeat length in 
      PC patients was 21.5 +/- 2.65, in controls 22.28 +/- 2.86 (p = 0.009) and in BPH 
      patients 22.1 +/- 2.52 (p = 0.038). Short CAG repeats (<19) were found in 21.64% of 
      PC patients vs. 9.43% in BPH patients (p = 0.0154). We also found an association 
      of low Gleason score (<7) with short CAG repeat (<19) in PC patients (p = 
      0.0306), and no association between the age at diagnosis of PC and BPH and CAG 
      repeat length. These results suggest that reduced CAG repeat length may be 
      associated with increased prostate cancer risk in Macedonian men.

PG  - 570-6
LID - 10.1016/j.meegid.2012.01.026 [doi]
AB  - In the present study, new variable number tandem repeats (VNTR) loci in the 
      Neisseria gonorrhoeae genome were identified in silico. VNTR analysis scheme 
      using PCR and agarose or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was developed based 
      on nine VNTR loci with various degrees of polymorphism. The method was used to 
      genotype a collection of 48 isolates, obtained from patients with gonorrhea in 
      Almaty, Kazakhstan during the period from December 2008 to November 2009. This 
      collection of isolates was also characterized by the opa-typing and multiantigen 
      sequence typing (NG-MAST). The discriminatory power of the VNTR analysis 
      translated by Hunter-Gaston Discrimination Index (HGDI) was similar to that of 
      opa typing (HGDI=0.98 versus 0.97) and slightly higher than that of NG-MAST 
      (HDGI=0.95). The adjusted Rand (AR) coefficients and Wallace coefficients showed 
      that the overall concordance between the typing methods was not high. VNTR 
      analysis described here is simple, inexpensive, easy to interpret, and it would 
      be reliable for the comparison of data obtained in different laboratories. The 
      proposed VNTR loci might be used for epidemiological studies of gonococcal 
      infections.

PG  - 1373-5

AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiological and clinical studies show higher prevalence of 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in males than in females and more severe 
      lesions in androgen receptor (AR)-expressing tissues. The AR gene contains a 
      polymorphic CAG trinucleotide repeat, whose expansion over a certain threshold is 
      toxic to motor neurons, causing spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). 
      PURPOSE AND METHODS: We tested the hypothesis that the AR CAG repeat linked to 
      SBMA is a risk factor for ALS. We analyzed AR CAG expansions in 336 patients with 
      ALS and 100 controls. RESULTS: We found a negative association of AR CAG 
      expansions with ALS susceptibility, clinical presentation, and survival. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not support a role of the AR CAG repeat length in 
      ALS.

TI  - CAG repeat polymorphism in androgen receptor gene is not directly associated with 
      polycystic ovary syndrome but influences serum testosterone levels.
PG  - 107-12
LID - 10.1016/j.jsbmb.2011.11.006 [doi]
AB  - Hyperandrogenemia has been the most consistent feature of polycystic ovary 
      syndrome (PCOS). Androgens exert their effects through androgen receptors (ARs). 
      The expansion of the codon CAG trinucleotide repeat polymorphism in exon 1 of the 
      AR gene represents a type of genetic alteration associated with changes in the AR 
      gene function. The purpose of this study was to establish a possible association 
      of the AR gene CAG repeat length polymorphism with PCOS, and its influence on 
      clinical and biochemical androgen traits. Two hundred and fourteen Croatian women 
      with PCOS and 209 healthy control women of reproductive age were enrolled. 
      Phenotypic hyperandrogenism, BMI and waist to hip ratio were recorded. Hormonal 
      profiles, fasting insulin and glucose levels were measured on cycle days 3-5. 
      Genotyping of the CAG repeat polymorphism in the AR gene was performed. We found 
      no significant difference in the mean CAG repeat number between the PCOS patients 
      and controls (22.1+/-3.4 vs. 21.9+/-3.2, P=0.286). There was a positive correlation 
      between the CAG repeat length and total testosterone (TT) in the PCOS group 
      (R=0.225, P=0.015). A multiple linear regression model using mean CAG repeat 
      length, BMI, age and HOMA-IR as predictors explained 8.5% (adjusted R(2)) of the 
      variability in serum TT levels. In this model the CAG repeat polymorphism was 
      found to be a significant predictor of serum TT levels in PCOS patients 
      (P=0.015). The logistic regression analysis revealed that the CAG repeat length 
      is not a significant predictor of hirsutism and acne status (P=0.921 and P=0.437, 
      respectively). The model was adjusted for serum TT, free testosterone, 
      androstendione and DHEAS levels as independent variables, which were also not 
      found to be significant predictors of hirsutism (P=0.687, P=0.194, P=0.675 and 
      P=0.938, respectively) or acne status (P=0.594, P=0.095, P=0.290 and P=0.151, 
      respectively). In conclusion, the AR CAG repeat polymorphism is not a major 
      determinant of PCOS in the Croatian population, but it is a predictor of serum TT 
      level variability in women with PCOS.

      ovary syndrome (PCOS).
PG  - 73-9
LID - 10.1055/s-0031-1291343 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a frequent heterogenic disorder 
      with a familial background. Androgenic effects, determining the clinical features 
      of the syndrome, are mediated by the androgen receptor (AR), whose activity is 
      modulated by a genetic polymorphism. We investigated the role of the CAG repeat 
      polymorphism of the androgen receptor in PCOS. METHODS: In the infertility unit 
      of a university clinic, 72 PCOS patients were compared with 179 ovulatory 
      controls undergoing a standardized diagnostic work-up. The number of CAG repeats 
      was determined by PCR, labelling with IR-800 and PAGE. X-chromosome inactivation 
      was assessed by a methylation-sensitive assay. RESULTS: Compared to controls, 
      PCOS patients displayed a shorter mean CAG repeat length, encoding for higher AR 
      activity (P=0.001). CAG repeat length correlated inversely with oligomenorrhea, a 
      central androgen dependent feature of the syndrome (P=0.005). In a binomial 
      regression analysis including BMI, LH and free testosterone, CAG repeat length 
      was identified as an independent risk factor for PCOS (P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      CAG repeat polymorphism could constitute one of the genetic factors modulating 
      the syndrome's phenotype, contributing to its clinical heterogeneity and 
      associated metabolic consequences.

TI  - Evaluation of CAG repeat length of androgen receptor expressing cells in human 
      testes showing different pictures of spermatogenic impairment.

LID - 10.1007/s00418-011-0871-6 [doi]
AB  - The androgen receptor (AR) is a ligand-activated transcriptional factor with 
      crucial importance for spermatogenesis. Its transactivation domain consists of a 
      polymorphic sequence of 9-36 cytosin-adenin-guanin (CAG) repeats. Within the 
      physiological range an increased CAG repeat length is assumed to correlate with 
      the reduced androgen sensitivity resulting in impaired spermatogenesis. In 33 
      testes of 32 patients showing different histological pictures ranging from normal 
      spermatogenesis, hypospermatogenesis to severe spermatogenetic impairment such as 
      maturation arrest, Sertoli cell only Syndrome (SCO) and mixed atrophy, CAG repeat 
      length was assessed in lymphocyte DNA, DNA/mRNA from testis homogenate and in 
      mRNA of AR expressing Sertoli cells within the seminiferous tubules, and 
      interstitial Leydig cells collected by the laser-assisted cell picking. The 
      latter examination was performed to detect a possible somatic mosaicism of CAG 
      repeat length in different testicular cell populations. CAG repeat lengths varied 
      from 12 to 27 repeats, i.e., within the physiological range. We found deviating 
      CAG repeat numbers in different fractions of AR expressing Sertoli and Leydig 
      cells indicating tissue heterogeneity. We did not find a correlation of CAG 
      repeat length to testicular histology or AR expression, and testosterone or 
      luteinizing hormone levels even in biopsies showing mixed atrophy. Additionally, 
      we evaluated the expression pattern of the AR-dependent gene androgen binding 
      protein (ABP), and did not find a correlation to CAG repeat, but a significant 
      reduction of ABP mRNA related to severe spermatogenic impairment in the 
      monomorphic histologies. These data suggest other factors than CAG repeat to be 
      responsible for severe spermatogenic impairment including mixed atrophy.

TI  - Relationship of obesity, androgen receptor genotypes and biochemical failure 
      after radical prostatectomy.
PG  - 984-90
LID - 10.1002/pros.21503 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity and androgen metabolism have been implicated in the 
      progression of prostate cancer. Obesity has been associated with increased risk 
      for advanced disease and biochemical failure after treatment. This association 
      may be the result of changes in androgen metabolism that occur with obesity and 
      are mediated by the androgen receptor (AR). METHODS: To evaluate the effects of 
      obesity and AR polymorphisms on biochemical failure, we conducted a study of 536 
      Caucasian prostate cancer cases. We determined the relationship between time to 
      biochemical failure and obesity stratified by short and long AR-CAG and AR-GGN 
      repeat sequence. The AR repeat groups were dichotomized at the median number of 
      repeats for each polymorphism. RESULTS: An association was found for obesity in 
      the short CAG group (HR = 3.45, 95% CI = 1.00-11.96). Among obese patients 
      diagnosed with localized disease (T1/T2), the risk of biochemical failure was 
      significantly higher (HR = 7.05, 95% CI = 1.55-32.06). No difference was observed 
      for high stage (T3/T4) obese patients. Additionally, no differences in 
      biochemical failure were observed in obese and non-obese men grouped by number of 
      AR-GGN repeats. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity is significantly associated with increased 
      risk of biochemical failure in men with the high-risk short CAG sequence on the 
      AR gene. This effect is not observed in men with long CAG repeats. Therefore, it 
      appears that the relationship between biochemical failure and obesity may be 
      modified by the AR-CAG repeat pattern. The short AR-CAG genotype may be more 
      responsive to an altered hormonal milieu created by obesity.

TI  - Genotype and phenotype in Klinefelter syndrome - impact of androgen receptor 
      polymorphism and skewed X inactivation.
PG  - e642-8
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2605.2011.01223.x [doi]
AB  - The phenotypic variation of Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is wide and may by caused 
      by various genetic and epigenetic effects. Skewed inactivation of the 
      supra-numerical X chromosome and polymorphism in the androgen receptor (AR) have 
      been suggested as plausible causes. We wanted to describe X-chromosome 
      inactivation patterns and the AR polymorphism and correlate these to clinical 
      findings in KS in a cross-sectional study. To that end, we studied 70 KS patients 
      enrolled from fertility clinics and endocrine clinics and 70 age-matched control 
      subjects. The main outcome was X-chromosome inactivation pattern (skewX), AR 
      polymorphism (CAGn - repeat length) and correlation to anthropometrical, 
      hormonal, metabolic and bone-related variables. Forty-six of 70 KS men were 
      heterozygous for CAGn. The shortest and the longest alleles were equally frequent 
      inactivated and the mean CAGn of the two alleles did not differ significantly 
      from the CAGn from either KS men, homozygous for the CAGn, or from the control 
      subjects (22 vs. 23 vs. 21). SkewX was found in 12 of the 46 informative KS men 
      (26%). In KS, height and arm span correlated positively to CAGn, whereas total 
      cholesterol and haematocrit correlated negatively to CAGn. In controls, bone 
      mineral density at the spine and hip correlated positively with CAGn, whereas 
      adiponectin correlated negatively with CAGn. SkewX did not correlate to any of 
      the investigated parameters. We conclude that CAGn polymorphism in AR explain 
      some of the phenotypic variation in KS, whereas skewed X-chromosome inactivation 
      did not. The impact of CAGn on final height may be caused by later reactivation 
      of the pituitary-gonadal axis.

TI  - Corepressor effect on androgen receptor activity varies with the length of the 
      CAG encoded polyglutamine repeat and is dependent on receptor/corepressor ratio 
      in prostate cancer cells.
PG  - 20-31
LID - 10.1016/j.mce.2011.05.023 [doi]
AB  - The response of prostate cells to androgens reflects a combination of androgen 
      receptor (AR) transactivation and transrepression, but how these two processes 
      differ mechanistically and influence prostate cancer risk and disease outcome 
      remain elusive. Given recent interest in targeting AR transrepressive processes, 
      a better understanding of AR/corepressor interaction and responses is warranted. 
      Here, we used transactivation and interaction assays with wild-type and mutant 
      ARs, and deletion AR fragments, to dissect the relationship between AR and the 
      corepressor, silencing mediator for retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors 
      (SMRT). We additionally tested how these processes are influenced by AR agonist 
      and antagonist ligands, as well as by variation in the polyglutamine tract in the 
      AR amino terminal domain (NTD), which is encoded by a polymorphic CAG repeat in 
      the gene. SMRT was recruited to the AR ligand binding domain by agonist ligand, 
      and as determined by the effect of strategic mutations in activation function 2 
      (AF-2), requires a precise conformation of that domain. A distinct region of SMRT 
      also mediated interaction with the AR-NTD via the transactivation unit 5 (TAU5; 
      residues 315-538) region. The degree to which SMRT was able to repress AR 
      increased from 17% to 56% as the AR polyglutamine repeat length was increased 
      from 9 to 42 residues, but critically this effect could be abolished by 
      increasing the SMRT:AR molar ratio. These data suggest that the extent to which 
      the CAG encoded polyglutamine repeat influences AR activity represents a balance 
      between corepressor and coactivator occupancy of the same ligand-dependent and 
      independent AR interaction surfaces. Changes in the homeostatic relationship of 
      AR to these molecules, including SMRT, may explain the variable penetrance of the 
      CAG repeat and the loss of AR signaling flexibility in prostate cancer 
      progression.

TI  - Polymorphism of CAG repeats in androgen receptor of carnivores.
PG  - 2297-303
LID - 10.1007/s11033-011-0979-8 [doi]
AB  - Androgen effect is mediated by the androgen receptor (AR). The polymorphism of 
      CAG triplet repeat (polyCAG), in the N-terminal transactivation domain of the AR 
      protein, has been involved either in endocrine or neurological disorders in 
      human. We obtained partial sequence of AR exon 1 in 10 carnivore species. In most 
      carnivore species, polyglutamine length polymorphism presented in all three CAG 
      repeat regions of AR, in contrast, only CAG-I site polymorphism presented in 
      primate species, and CAG-I and CAG-III sites polymorphism presented in Canidae. 
      Therefore, studies focusing on disease-associated polymorphism of poly(CAG) in 
      carnivore species AR should investigate all three CAG repeats sites, and should 
      not only consider CAG-I sites as the human disease studies. The trinucleotide 
      repeat length in carnivore AR exon 1 had undergone from expansions to 
      contractions during carnivores evolution, unlike a linear increase in primate 
      species. Furthermore, the polymorphisms of the triplet-repeats in the same tissue 
      (somatic mosaicism) were demonstrated in Moutain weasel, Eurasian lynx, Clouded 
      leopard, Chinese tiger, Black leopard and Leopard AR. And, the abnormal stop 
      codon was found in the exon 1 of three carnivore species AR (Moutain weasel, 
      Eurasian lynx and Black leopard). It seemed to have a high frequency presence of 
      tissue-specific somatic in carnivores AR genes. Thus the in vivo mechanism 
      leading to such highly variable phenotypes of the described mutations, and their 
      impact on these animals, are worthwhile to be further elucidated.

LID - 10.1093/carcin/bgr104 [doi]
AB  - Increasing rates of testicular germ cells tumors (TGCTs) overtime suggest that 
      environmental factors are involved in disease etiology, but familial risk and 
      genome-wide association studies implicate genetic factors as well. We 
      investigated whether variation in the functional CAG(n) polymorphism in the 
      androgen receptor (AR) gene is associated with TGCT risk, using data from a 
      population-based family study. We estimated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence 
      intervals (CI) for the association of CAG repeat length and TGCT risk using 
      matched pairs logistic regression. Analyses of 273 TGCT case-mother pairs 
      revealed no association between AR CAG repeat length and overall TGCT risk. 
      However, risk of seminoma was significantly associated with shorter CAG repeat 
      length [CAG 20-21 versus CAG </= 19: OR = 0.82 (95% CI: 0.43-1.58), CAG 22-23 
      versus CAG </= 19: OR = 0.39 (95% CI: 0.19-0.83) and CAG >/= 24 versus CAG </= 19: OR = 
      0.42 (95% CI: 0.20-0.86)], with a highly significant trend over these four 
      categories of decreasing CAG repeat length (P(trend) = 0.0030). This is the first 
      report of a statistically significant association between AR CAG repeat length 
      and seminoma risk, suggesting that increased AR transactivation may be involved 
      in development of seminoma and/or progression of carcinoma in situ/intratubular 
      germ cell neoplasia unclassified to seminoma. This result provides a rationale 
      whereby androgenic environmental compounds could contribute to increases in TGCT 
      incidence, and identifies for the first time a potential biological pathway 
      influencing whether TGCTs achieve seminomatous versus nonseminomatous histology, 
      a clinically and biologically important distinction.

AB  - The CAG repeat and its association with infertility has been debatable. 
      Therefore, this study was planned to assess the distribution of CAG repeat 
      expansion in Egyptian patients and to investigate its association with male 
      infertility. Forty-five infertile men were eligible for the study in addition to 
      20 aged-matched fertile males as control. Semen analysis, scrotal sonography, 
      assay of serum testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising 
      hormone (LH), and determination of the CAG repeat number within exon 1 of the 
      androgen receptor (AR) gene were carried out. Statistically significant 
      difference was found between infertile and control groups regarding sperm count, 
      sperm motility, serum FSH level and CAG repeats (P < 0.05); statistically 
      insignificant difference for the CAG repeats (P = 1.0) was found between 
      oligozoospermic and asthenospermic groups; negative correlation was found between 
      CAG repeat length and sperm count, and a positive correlation was found between 
      CAG repeat length and serum FSH (P < 0.05). Our results validate the concept that 
      long stretches of CAG repeat may be associated with lower AR function with 
      derangement of sperm production, and this may contribute to male infertility in 
      Egyptian men.

      length in men with systemic lupus erythematosus.

AB  - We sought to explore whether inherited differences in androgen sensitivity 
      conferred by variation in the length of a CAG repeat in exon 1 of the androgen 
      receptor gene could be correlated with differing manifestations of humoral 
      autoimmunity in men with lupus. In a sample of 15 men with lupus, AR CAG repeat 
      length was linearly correlated with levels of antibodies against extractable 
      nuclear antigens and with the number of diagnostic criteria for lupus. Protein 
      microarrays were used to assess levels of 86 different IgG and IgM autoantibodies 
      in the sera of these patients. IgG autoantibodies were more frequently observed 
      in male lupus patients with longer AR CAG repeat length (>23), while IgM 
      autoantibodies were more prevalent in subjects with shorter CAG repeat length 
      (</=23). These data support a potential role for androgen signaling in the 
      modulation of immunoglobulin class switching processes, with consequent impact on 
      the autoimmune phenotype in men with lupus.

TI  - Germline CAG repeat length of the androgen receptor and time to progression in 
      patients with prostate cancer treated with androgen deprivation therapy.
PG  - 1086-91
LID - 10.1111/j.1464-410X.2010.10037.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: * Germline CAG repeat polymorphisms in the androgen receptor (AR-CAG) 
      have been shown to influence the activity of the AR. * The purpose of the present 
      study was to determine if AR-CAG repeat length correlates with time to 
      progression on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: * 
      Germline AR-CAG repeat lengths were determined in a cohort of 480 patients with 
      recurrent or metastatic prostate cancer treated at a single tertiary care 
      institution and correlated to time to progression (TTP) and overall survival. 
      RESULTS: * There was no significant correlation between differences in the AR-CAG 
      repeat lengths and TTP or overall survival in patients with prostate cancer 
      receiving ADT. * AR-CAG repeat lengths did not significantly correlate with age, 
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Gleason score or clinical stage at diagnosis. * 
      In patients with metastatic disease, longer AR-CAG repeat lengths (>23 vs </=23) 
      were associated with a longer TTP on ADT, but this finding was of borderline 
      significance (median TTP 18.3 vs 15.5 months, P = 0.09; adjusted HR = 0.76, 95% 
      confidence interval = 0.54-1.09). CONCLUSIONS: * This is the largest published 
      study to date investigating the association of germline AR-CAG repeat lengths and 
      efficacy of ADT in prostate cancer. * Germline AR-CAG repeat lengths do not 
      predict response to ADT.

TI  - Bone mass in subjects with Klinefelter syndrome: role of testosterone levels and 
      androgen receptor gene CAG polymorphism.
PG  - E739-45
LID - 10.1210/jc.2010-1878 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is a chromosomal alteration characterized by 
      supernumerary X-chromosome(s), primary hypogonadism, decreased pubertal peak bone 
      mineral density (BMD), and accelerated bone loss during adulthood. Decreased bone 
      mass has been traditionally related to low testosterone levels. However, 
      testosterone replacement therapy does not necessarily increase bone mass in these 
      patients, and low BMD can be observed also in patients with normal testosterone 
      levels. The androgen receptor (AR) gene CAG polymorphism seems to modulate the 
      sensitivity to testosterone and previous studies have related it to some clinical 
      aspects of KS, to include BMD, gynecomastia, testes and prostate volume, and 
      hemoglobin concentration. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the relation between bone mass, 
      testosterone, and AR CAG polymorphism in men with KS. DESIGN: Cross-sectional 
      cohort study. SETTING: University department. PATIENTS: One hundred twelve 
      consecutive treatment-naive 47,XXY Klinefelter patients (mean age 33.5 +/- 4.7 yr) 
      and 51 age-matched normal male controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dual-energy x-ray 
      absorptiometry, CAG repeat length polymorphism, X-chromosome inactivation, and 
      testosterone levels. RESULTS: Forty-nine of 112 KS subjects (42.5%) had low bone 
      mass (osteopenia or osteoporosis). Lumbar and/or femoral T-scores were lower in 
      KS patients compared with controls. No significant relationship was observed 
      between testosterone levels and bone parameters, and the prevalence of 
      osteopenia/osteoporosis was similar in subjects with normal and low testosterone 
      levels (43.7% and 40.5%, respectively). The mean CAG repeat length calculated 
      after X-chromosome inactivation analysis showed no differences between patients 
      with normal and low bone mass. CONCLUSIONS: Testosterone levels and AR CAG 
      polymorphism are not associated with bone mass phenotype in KS.

TI  - Mutant CAG repeats of Huntingtin transcript fold into hairpins, form nuclear foci 
      and are targets for RNA interference.
PG  - 3852-63
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkq1323 [doi]
AB  - The CAG repeat expansions that occur in translated regions of specific genes can 
      cause human genetic disorders known as polyglutamine (poly-Q)-triggered diseases. 
      Huntington's disease and spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) are examples of 
      these diseases in which underlying mutations are localized near other 
      trinucleotide repeats in the huntingtin (HTT) and androgen receptor (AR) genes, 
      respectively. Mutant proteins that contain expanded polyglutamine tracts are 
      well-known triggers of pathogenesis in poly-Q diseases, but a toxic role for 
      mutant transcripts has also been proposed. To gain insight into the structural 
      features of complex triplet repeats of HTT and AR transcripts, we determined 
      their structures in vitro and showed the contribution of neighboring repeats to 
      CAG repeat hairpin formation. We also demonstrated that the expanded transcript 
      is retained in the nucleus of human HD fibroblasts and is colocalized with the 
      MBNL1 protein. This suggests that the CAG repeats in the HTT mRNA adopt ds-like 
      RNA conformations in vivo. The intracellular structure of the CAG repeat region 
      of mutant HTT transcripts was not sufficiently stable to be protected from 
      cleavage by an siRNA targeting the repeats and the silencing efficiency was 
      higher for the mutant transcript than for its normal counterpart.

TI  - Are GSTM1, GSTT1 and CAG repeat length of androgen receptor gene polymorphisms 
      associated with risk of prostate cancer in Iranian patients?

AB  - We conducted this study to investigate whether CAG repeat length in androgen 
      receptor gene and GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms influence prostate cancer risk in 
      Iranian newly diagnosed cancer patients compared to age-matched BPH group and 
      healthy individuals. DNA from 110 pathologically-confirmed prostate cancer 
      patients, 99 age-matched men with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and 100 
      healthy individuals were extracted and amplified by polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR). PCR products were examined by electrophoresis and sequencing. The mean 
      number of CAG repeat in prostate cancer patients was significantly smaller than 
      normal (19.9 vs 22.8; p < 0.0001) and BPH groups (19.9 vs 21.9; P < 0.0001) The 
      mean difference between normal individuals and BPH group was also significant 
      (21.9 vs. 22.8; P = 0.003). Presence of GSTM1 null genotype were significantly 
      higher in cancer and BPH group vs. normal individuals (both P values < 0.0001). 
      there was not seen association between GSTT1 null or positive genotype with 
      cancer risk, but analysis of GSTM1 null and GSTT1 positive in combination was 
      statistically associated with Prostate cancer risk (OR = 8.4, 95% CI 1.53-46.73). 
      Our results showed that CAG repeat polymorphism in AR gene may act as a risk 
      modifier and GSTM1 null genotypes also may be contributed to prostate cancer 
      susceptibility in Iranian patients.

TI  - Polymorphic variation in the androgen receptor gene: association with risk of 
      testicular germ cell cancer and metastatic disease.
PG  - 413-9
LID - 10.1016/j.ejca.2010.08.017 [doi]
AB  - Increasing incidence of testicular germ cell cancer (TGCC) is most probably 
      related to environment and lifestyle. However, an underlying genetic 
      predisposition may play a role and since sex steroids are assumed to be important 
      for the rise and progression of TGCC, a study of androgen receptor (AR) gene 
      polymorphisms in relation to the risk, histological type and progression of TGCC 
      was undertaken. In 367 TGCC cases and 214 controls, AR CAG and GGN repeat lengths 
      were determined and 11 haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
      were genotyped. By binary logistic regression, odds ratios (ORs) and 95% 
      confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated for the risk of TGCC, non-seminoma 
      versus seminoma and metastatic versus localised (stage I) disease. For the 
      non-coding SNP, rs12014709, the minor genotype (G) was found in 10% of the cases 
      and in 5.1% of the controls, conferring an OR of 2.07 (95% CI: 1.03-4.15) for 
      having TGCC. Furthermore, short GGN (<23) was associated with an increased risk 
      of metastatic disease (OR: 2.15; 95% CI: 1.04-4.45). The AR polymorphisms found 
      by us might be involved in gene-environment interaction by increasing the 
      susceptibility to the effect of endocrine disruptors. From a biological point of 
      view, our findings strengthen the hypothesis of the importance of androgen action 
      in the aetiology and pathogenesis of testicular malignancy. Future studies should 
      focus on the impact of sex hormones on foetal germ cell development and the 
      interaction between environmental factors and androgen receptor variants in 
      relation to the risk of testicular malignancy.

TI  - Prenatal flutamide enhances survival in a myogenic mouse model of spinal bulbar 
      muscular atrophy.
PG  - 25-34
LID - 10.1159/000313682 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is caused by a CAG repeat 
      expansion mutation in the androgen receptor (AR) gene, and mutant AR is presumed 
      to act in motoneurons to cause SBMA. However, we found that mice overexpressing 
      wild-type (wt) AR solely in skeletal muscle fibers display the same 
      androgen-dependent disease phenotype as when mutant AR is broadly expressed, 
      challenging the assumptions that only an expanded AR can induce disease and that 
      SBMA is strictly neurogenic. We have previously reported that AR toxicity was 
      ligand dependent in our model, and that very few transgenic (tg) males survived 
      beyond birth. METHODS: We tested whether the AR antagonist flutamide could block 
      perinatal toxicity. tg males were treated prenatally with flutamide and assessed 
      for survival and motor behavior in adulthood. RESULTS: Prenatal treatment with 
      flutamide rescued tg male pups from perinatal death, and, as adults, such 
      perinatally rescued tg males showed an SBMA phenotype that was comparable to that 
      of previously described untreated tg males. Moreover, tg males carrying a mutant 
      endogenous allele for AR--the testicular feminization mutation (tfm)--and thus 
      having functional AR only in muscle fibers nevertheless displayed the same 
      androgen-dependent disease phenotype as adults. CONCLUSIONS: These mice represent 
      an excellent model to study the myogenic contribution to SBMA as they display 
      many of the core features of disease as other mouse models. These data 
      demonstrate that AR acting exclusively in muscle fibers is sufficient to induce 
      SBMA symptoms and that flutamide is protective perinatally.

TI  - FMR1 gene expansion, large deletion of Xp, and skewed X-inactivation in a girl 
      with mental retardation and autism.
PG  - 1273-7
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.33352 [doi]
AB  - We describe a girl with mild facial anomalies, mild mental retardation, and 
      atypical autism with a remarkable behavioral phenotype of persistent anger, 
      aggression, and dysphoria. The occurrence of late-onset tremor and premature 
      ovarian failure in the maternal branch of the family pointed to a possible defect 
      in the FMR1 gene. Indeed, the patient carried a full FMR1 mutation. Unexpectedly, 
      both alleles of the gene were almost completely methylated. Cytogenetic 
      examination of the patient revealed in addition a large de novo deletion in band 
      Xp22 on one of her X chromosomes. The deletion was fine mapped using 
      oligonucleotide array CGH, and its breakpoints were localized using sequencing. 
      The size of the deletion was about 17.4 Mb, and it contained more than 90 
      protein-coding genes. Microsatellite analysis indicated paternal origin of the 
      aberrant chromosome. The large rearrangement was the most probable cause of the 
      X-inactivation skewing, thus explaining the methylation of not only the expanded 
      (maternal) but also the normal (paternal) FMR1 alleles. This pattern of skewed 
      X-inactivation was confirmed using the analysis of methylation at the AR locus. 
      The relatively mild phenotype of the patient resulted most likely from unmasking 
      of the FMR1 defect. Although the deleted region contained many important genes, 
      the phenotypic contribution of the rearranged X chromosome was probably limited 
      by its almost complete inactivation. However, reduced dose of several genes 
      escaping X-inactivation might also play a role in the phenotype of the patient.

TI  - Interaction between estrogens and androgen receptor genes microsatellites, 
      prostate-specific antigen and androgen receptor expressions in breast cancer.
PG  - 198-206
AB  - The role of estrogen and androgen receptors signaling in breast cancer is widely 
      accepted, but the interrelations between them are not well understood. It was 
      suggested that PSA could be a marker of endogenous balance between androgens and 
      estrogens. In this context, we intended to investigate the potential of 
      relationship between polymorphic tandem repeats (CAG, TA and CA) in AR (androgen 
      receptor), ERalpha (estrogen receptor alpha) and ERbeta (estrogen receptor beta) 
      genes and the immunoexpression of PSA and AR proteins. We assessed also the 
      possible influences of CAG, TA, and CA variables and other available prognostic 
      factors (ER, PR, AR, HER2/neu, PSA expression, and nodal status) on disease-free 
      survival. We assessed the polymorphic tandem repeats lengths by genotyping, 
      followed by high-resolution denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 163 
      breast cancers. Immunohistochemistry was performed to assess the expressions of 
      AR, PSA, ER, PR and HER2/neu proteins. Our results showed that PSA was correlated 
      with the length of CA repeats in the 3'-untranslated region of ERbeta, shorter CA 
      repeats being correlated with PSA expression (p=0.03). AR immunoexpression was 
      correlated with CAG repeats on AR gene, higher number of repeats being linked to 
      a higher AR immunoexpression (p=0.04). Performing logistic regression to 
      investigate relationships with prognosis, we observed that PSA immunoexpression 
      (p=0.004), the nodal status (p-<0.001) and marginally, longer TA repeats (p=0.05) 
      were correlated with increased disease-free survival. AR expression presented a 
      low statistical value (p=0.054) in predicting evolution and was not entered into 
      the multivariate regression analysis. Altogether, our findings supports the 
      hypothesis that estrogens, through both alpha and beta-receptors variants are 
      mediating the AR signaling pathway.

TI  - No correlation between androgen receptor CAG and GGN repeat length and the degree 
      of genital virilization in females with 21-hydroxylase deficiency.
PG  - 2443-50
LID - 10.1210/jc.2009-1338 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: In 21-hydroxylase (CYP21A2) deficiency (21OHD), the level of in vitro 
      enzymatic function allows for classification of mutation groups (null, A, B, C) 
      and prediction of disease severity. However, genital virilization in affected 
      females correlates only weakly with CYP21A2 mutation groups, suggesting the 
      influence of genetic modifiers. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to 
      investigate the influence of the polymorphic CAG and GGn repeats of the androgen 
      receptor (AR) gene on the degree of genital virilization in 21OHD females. DESIGN 
      AND PATIENTS: Design of the study was the determination of CYP21A2 genotype, 
      degree of genital virilization (Prader stage), and X-weighted biallelic mean of 
      AR CAG and GGn repeat length in 205 females with 21OHD. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: 
      Correlation of AR CAG and GGn repeat lengths with Prader stages using nested 
      stepwise logistic regression analysis was measured. RESULTS: CYP21A2 mutation 
      groups null and A showed significantly higher levels of genital virilization than 
      groups B and C (P < 0.01). However, Prader stages varied considerably within 
      mutation groups: null, Prader I-V (median IV); A, Prader I-V (median IV); B, 
      Prader I-V (median III); C, 0-III (median I). Mean GGn repeat length of patients 
      was not significantly associated with Prader stages, classified as low (0-I), 
      intermediate (II-III), or severe (IV-V) (odds ratio per repeat: 0.98, 95% 
      confidence interval 0.71-1.35). In contrast, patients with Prader 0-I showed a 
      trend toward longer CAG repeats without reaching statistical significance (P = 
      0.07, odds ratio per repeat: 0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.65-1.02). 
      CONCLUSION: Neither CAG nor GGn repeat lengths are statistically significant 
      modifiers of genital virilization in females with 21OHD.

AB  - We report the clinical and electrophysiological features of a large Turkish 
      family with genetically confirmed X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy 
      (SBMA). Family members were identified by field work. A detailed history was 
      obtained from each subject, and each subject received a detailed neurological 
      examination. To confirm the CAG repeat expansion in the AR gene, genomic DNA was 
      extracted from the peripheral blood of patients. The family consisted of 128 
      individuals over five generations, with two consanguineous parents, one slightly 
      affected female, and 12 affected males with SBMA. We studied the five surviving 
      male patients and one surviving female carrier. The age at disease onset, 
      phenotypic features, and disease severity varied among the family members. DNA 
      analysis was performed on five individuals, belonging to five generations of the 
      family. Four affected males and a slightly affected female carrier were shown to 
      carry an expanded CAG repeat in the androgen receptor gene. This family report is 
      consistent with previous studies suggesting that SBMA may be present with a wide 
      clinical spectrum in affected family members. Further descriptions of SBMA 
      affected families with different ethnic backgrounds may assist in identifying 
      possible phenotypic and genetic features of the disease.

TI  - CAG repeats in the androgen receptor gene are shorter in patients with pulmonary, 
      esophageal or bladder carcinoma and longer in women with uterine leiomyoma.
PG  - 811-8
AB  - Preferential occurrence of pulmonary, esophageal and bladder carcinomas in males 
      indicate a possible involvement of androgen receptor (AR)-mediated functions. We 
      evaluated the roles of the CAG repeat polymorphism in AR exon 1 in development of 
      these lesions. The exon 1 of AR gene was amplified in samples from 198 male 
      patients with lung carcinoma, 183 with esophageal carcinoma, 95 with bladder 
      carcinoma and 94 males with appendicitis, as a reference group. Mean numbers of 
      the CAG repeat in these 3 cancer groups were determined to be 20.2, 20.0 and 
      20.0, respectively, all being significantly smaller than that of the reference 
      group (21.1; P<0.05). Samples from 118 female patients with lung carcinoma and 
      154 females with appendicitis, as a reference group, were examined, with the mean 
      CAG repeat number significantly smaller (19.8) than that of the female reference 
      group (20.7; P<0.01). Samples from 108 patients with uterine leiomyoma were also 
      examined, and their CAG repeat numbers were found to be markedly expanded (23.4; 
      P<0.01). The patients with multiple leiomyomas tend to carry a longer CAG repeat 
      structure, with the mean CAG repeat number longer in the multicentric multiple 
      cases (24.1) compared to that of the unicentric, multinodular cases (22.2) and 
      those with solitary lesions (23.1; P<0.01). These results indicate that a shorter 
      CAG repeat structure may predispose individuals to a higher risk to some 
      male-predominant neoplasms including pulmonary, esophageal and bladder carcinomas 
      and a longer one confers women greater susceptibility to leiomyoma development in 
      the uterus.

TI  - Polymorphic (CAG)n repeats in the androgen receptor gene: a risk marker for 
      endometriosis and uterine leiomyomas.
PG  - 289-93
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endometriosis and uterine leiomyomas are leading hormone responsive, 
      benign uterine disorders responsible for high morbidity in women of reproductive 
      age group. A polymorphic (CAG)n repeat length located in exon 1 of the androgen 
      receptor (AR) gene has been proposed as a risk marker for both endometriosis and 
      leiomyomas in some ethnic groups. The present study was carried out to assess the 
      frequency of AR (CAG)n repeat polymorphism as a risk marker for endometriosis and 
      uterine leiomyomas in Asian Indian women. METHODS: DNA was isolated from 
      peripheral blood samples of 331 subjects, which include 90 endometriosis cases, 
      140 cases of leiomyomas and 101 healthy age- and sex-matched controls. PCR was 
      carried out to amplify exon 1 of the AR gene. All the PCR amplicons were analysed 
      initially on 2% agarose gel electrophoresis, followed by bidirectional sequencing 
      to calculate the number CAG repeats in individuals. RESULTS: The CAG repeat 
      ranges detected in endometriosis cases were 4-33 (Mode-19) and in leiomyomas 
      cases 5-34 (Mode-20), whereas in controls it was 5-34 (Mode-22). A distinct 
      variation was observed in the three groups at 14, 18, 19, 20 and 22 (CAG)n 
      repeats, which were statistically analyzed using chi-square and odds ratio tests. 
      19 CAG repeats were found to be higher in endometriosis cases (19.09%) when 
      compared with controls (9.04%), while 20 CAG repeats were higher in leiomyomas 
      cases (14.02%) compared to controls (6.14%). A statistically significant (P < 
      0.05) association was observed in 19 and 20 CAG repeats in endometriosis and 
      leiomyomas, respectively. CONCLUSION: This is the first report from an Asian 
      Indian population proposing that 19 and 20 CAG repeats of the AR gene are 
      associated with endometriosis and leiomyoma and can be regarded as high-risk 
      markers.

TI  - Molecular mechanisms involving prostate cancer racial disparity.
PG  - 235-48
AB  - African American (AA) men with prostate cancer (PCa) have worse disease, with a 
      higher incidence, younger age and more advanced disease at diagnosis, and a worse 
      prognosis, compared to Caucasian (CA) men. In addition to socioeconomic factors 
      and lifestyle differences, molecular alterations contribute to this discrepancy. 
      In this review, we summarize molecular genetics research results interrelated 
      with the biology of PCa racial disparity. Androgen and androgen receptor (AR) 
      pathways have long been associated with prostate growth. Racial differences have 
      also been found among variants of the genes of the enzymes involved in androgen 
      biosynthesis and metabolism, such as SRD5A2, CYP17, and CYP3A4. The levels of 
      expression and CAG repeat length of AR also show racial divergence and may be 
      critical molecular alterations for racial disparity. Growth factors and their 
      receptors, which promote cancer cell growth, are another potential cause of the 
      disparity; both EGFR and EPHB2, two of the most studied receptors, show 
      interethnic differences. Differences have also been found among genes regulating 
      cell apoptosis, such as BCL2, which is increased in PCa in the AA population. 
      Recent developments in genetics, proteomics, and genomics, among other molecular 
      biotechnologies, will greatly aid the advancement of translational research on 
      PCa racial disparity, hopefully culminating in the discovery of novel mechanisms 
      of disease, in addition to prognostic markers and novel therapeutic approaches.

TI  - Impact of androgen receptor cytosine-adenine-guanine polymorphisms on clinical 
      outcome in BRCA mutation-associated epithelial ovarian cancers.
PG  - 105-8
LID - 10.1016/j.ygyno.2009.09.020 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Androgen signaling may function in the pathobiology of epithelial 
      ovarian cancers associated with mutations in the BRCA1/2 genes. Androgen receptor 
      (AR) activity correlates inversely with length of a polymorphic 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat in exon 1. We hypothesized that AR CAG 
      allele length is a modifier of clinical outcome in BRCA1/2 mutation positive 
      women with ovarian cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We identified BRCA1/2 ovarian 
      cancer patients with banked serum from which we PCR amplified the CAG repeat 
      region. We abstracted clinical and survival data, and examined CAG repeat length 
      <19 as a short AR allelotype. We calculated a sample size of 60 patients to 
      determine a 24-month difference in survival. RESULT: In 62 patients, 43 (69%) had 
      BRCA1 mutations and 19 (31%) had BRCA2 mutations. Fifteen (24%) were found to 
      have a short AR allelotype. Patients with a short AR did not demonstrate 
      statistical differences in progression-free survival (43 months vs. 28 months for 
      long AR) or overall survival (78 months vs. 142 months for long AR). In patients 
      with BRCA2 mutations alone, a short AR correlated with decreased overall survival 
      (31 months) compared to 126 months for those with a long AR (p=0.01). 
      CONCLUSIONS: AR allelotype length did not correlate with survival in this 
      statistically representative cohort of patients with BRCA1/2 mutations. Potential 
      associations between short AR and outcome in BRCA2-associated ovarian cancers 
      remain to be determined.

TI  - Altered RNA splicing contributes to skeletal muscle pathology in Kennedy disease 
      knock-in mice.
PG  - 500-7
LID - 10.1242/dmm.003301 [doi]
AB  - Here, we used a mouse model of Kennedy disease, a degenerative disorder caused by 
      an expanded CAG repeat in the androgen receptor (AR) gene, to explore pathways 
      leading to cellular dysfunction. We demonstrate that male mice containing a 
      targeted Ar allele with 113 CAG repeats (AR113Q mice) exhibit hormone- and 
      glutamine length-dependent missplicing of Clcn1 RNA in skeletal muscle. Changes 
      in RNA splicing are associated with increased expression of the RNA-binding 
      protein CUGBP1. Furthermore, we show that skeletal muscle denervation in the 
      absence of a repeat expansion leads to increased CUGBP1 expression. However, this 
      induction of CUGBP1 is not sufficient to alter Clcn1 RNA splicing, indicating 
      that changes mediated by both denervation and AR113Q toxicity contribute to 
      altered RNA processing. To test this notion directly, we exogenously expressed 
      the AR in vitro and observed hormone-dependent changes in the splicing of 
      pre-mRNAs from a human cardiac troponin T minigene. These effects were notably 
      similar to changes mediated by RNA with expanded CUG tracts, but not CAG tracts, 
      highlighting unanticipated similarities between CAG and CUG repeat diseases. The 
      expanded glutamine AR also altered hormone-dependent splicing of a 
      calcitonin/calcitonin gene-related peptide minigene, suggesting that toxicity of 
      the mutant protein additionally affects RNA processing pathways that are distinct 
      from those regulated by CUGBP1. Our studies demonstrate the occurrence of 
      hormone-dependent alterations in RNA splicing in Kennedy disease models, and they 
      indicate that these changes are mediated by both the cell-autonomous effects of 
      the expanded glutamine AR protein and by alterations in skeletal muscle that are 
      secondary to denervation.

TI  - Longer CAG repeat length in the androgen receptor gene is associated with 
      premature ovarian failure.
PG  - 3230-5
LID - 10.1093/humrep/dep296 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Premature ovarian failure (POF) is a disorder characterized by lack 
      of ovulation and elevated serum gonadotrophin levels before the age of 40 years. 
      The cause of POF in most cases is unknown. As mice lacking the Androgen receptor 
      (Ar) gene reportedly have a POF-like phenotype, we hypothesize that, variations 
      in the AR gene maybe one of the causative factors for POF in humans. Thus the 
      objective of the study is to evaluate the number of CAG repeats in exon 1 of the 
      AR gene in non-familial, non-syndromic cases of POF. METHODS: A clinic-based 
      case-control study. Seventy-eight patients with non-familial, non-syndromic POF, 
      and 90 controls were recruited to investigate the CAG repeat numbers in exon 1 of 
      the AR gene by PCR and Gene Scan analysis. RESULTS: The mean CAG repeat length in 
      exon 1 of the AR gene of women with POF was 23.6 +/- 3.8, which was significantly 
      higher than controls (20.08 +/- 3.45) (P < 0.001). The biallelic mean CAG repeat 
      ranged from 11 to 32 in the control women, compared to 16 to 30 in the POF 
      patients. The 22 CAG repeat allele followed by the 24 CAG repeat allele was found 
      to be at highest frequency (15.38 and 12.8%) in POF cases, although the 19 CAG 
      repeat allele was observed at highest frequency (12.2%) in controls. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The observation suggests that the CAG repeat length is increased in women with 
      POF as compared with controls, and may be pathogenic for POF, at least in a 
      subset of Indian women.

      attenuates polyglutamine-mediated aggregation.
PG  - 21296-306
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M109.011494 [doi]
AB  - The neurodegenerative disorder spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy or Kennedy 
      disease is caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion within the androgen 
      receptor (AR) gene. The resulting expanded polyglutamine tract in the N-terminal 
      region of the receptor renders AR prone to ligand-dependent misfolding and 
      formation of oligomers and aggregates that are linked to neuronal toxicity. How 
      AR misfolding is influenced by post-translational modifications, however, is 
      poorly understood. AR is a target of SUMOylation, and this modification inhibits 
      AR activity in a promoter context-dependent manner. SUMOylation is up-regulated 
      in response to multiple forms of cellular stress and may therefore play an 
      important cytoprotective role. Consistent with this view, we find that gratuitous 
      enhancement of overall SUMOylation significantly reduced the formation of 
      polyglutamine-expanded AR aggregates without affecting the levels of the 
      receptor. Remarkably, this effect requires SUMOylation of AR itself because it 
      depends on intact AR SUMOylation sites. Functional analyses, however, indicate 
      that the protective effects of enhanced AR SUMOylation are not due to alterations 
      in AR transcriptional activity because a branched protein structure in the 
      appropriate context of the N-terminal region of AR is necessary to antagonize 
      aggregation but not for inhibiting AR transactivation. Remarkably, small 
      ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) attenuates AR aggregation through a unique 
      mechanism that does not depend on critical features essential for its interaction 
      with canonical SUMO binding motifs. Our findings therefore reveal a novel 
      function of SUMOylation and suggest that approaches that enhance AR SUMOylation 
      may be of clinical use in polyglutamine expansion diseases.

AB  - Numerous mutations of the human androgen receptor (AR) gene cause an intersexual 
      phenotype, called the androgen insensitivity syndrome. The intersexual phenotype 
      is also quite often diagnosed in dogs. The aim of this study was to conduct a 
      comparative analysis of the entire coding sequence (eight exons) of the AR gene 
      in healthy and four intersex dogs, as well as in three other canids (the red fox, 
      arctic fox and Chinese raccoon dog). The coding sequence of the studied species 
      appeared to be conserved (similarity above 97%) and polymorphism was found in 
      exon 1 only. Altogether, 2 SNPs were identified in healthy dogs, 14 in red foxes, 
      16 in arctic foxes and 6 were found in Chinese raccoon dogs, respectively. 
      Moreover, a variable number of tandem repeats (CAG and CAA), encoding an array of 
      glutamines, was also observed in this exon. The CAA codon numbers were invariable 
      within species, but the CAG repeats were polymorphic. The highest number of the 
      CAG and CAA repeats was found in dogs (from 40 to 42) and the observed 
      variability was similar in intersex and healthy dogs. In the other canids the 
      variability fell within the following ranges: 29-37 (red fox), 37-39 (arctic fox) 
      and 29-32 (Chinese raccoon dog). In addition, a polymorphic microsatellite marker 
      in intron 2 was found in the dog, red fox and Chinese raccoon dog. It was 
      concluded that the polymorphism level of the AR gene in the dog was lower than in 
      the other canids and none of the detected polymorphisms, including variability of 
      the CAG tandem repeats, could be related with the intersexual phenotype of the 
      studied dogs.

TI  - Aberrant E2F activation by polyglutamine expansion of androgen receptor in SBMA 
      neurotoxicity.
PG  - 3818-22
LID - 10.1073/pnas.0809819106 [doi]
AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused 
      by a polyglutamine repeat (polyQ) expansion within the human androgen receptor 
      (AR). Unlike other neurodegenerative diseases caused by abnormal polyQ expansion, 
      the onset of SBMA depends on androgen binding to mutant human polyQ-AR proteins. 
      This is also observed in Drosophila eyes ectopically expressing the polyQ-AR 
      mutants. We have genetically screened mediators of androgen-induced 
      neurodegeneration caused by polyQ-AR mutants in Drosophila eyes. We identified 
      Rbf (Retinoblastoma-family protein), the Drosophila homologue of human Rb 
      (Retinoblastoma protein), as a neuroprotective factor. Androgen-dependent 
      association of Rbf or Rb with AR was remarkably potentiated by aberrant polyQ 
      expansion. Such potentiated Rb association appeared to attenuate recruitment of 
      histone deacetyltransferase 1 (HDAC1), a corepressor of E2F function. Either 
      overexpression of Rbf or E2F deficiency in fly eyes reduced the neurotoxicity of 
      the polyQ-AR mutants. Induction of E2F function by polyQ-AR-bound androgen was 
      suppressed by Rb in human neuroblastoma cells. We conclude that abnormal 
      expansion of polyQ may potentiate innate androgen-dependent association of AR 
      with Rb. This appears to lead to androgen-dependent onset of SBMA through 
      aberrant E2F transactivation caused by suppressed histone deacetylation.

AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an inherited neuromuscular disorder 
      caused by a polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansion in the androgen receptor (AR). 
      PolyQ-AR neurotoxicity may involve generation of an N-terminal truncation 
      fragment, as such peptides occur in SBMA patients and mouse models. To elucidate 
      the basis of SBMA, we expressed N-terminal truncated AR in motor neuron-derived 
      cells and primary cortical neurons. Accumulation of polyQ-AR truncation fragments 
      in the cytosol resulted in neurodegeneration and apoptotic, caspase-dependent 
      cell death. Using primary neurons from mice transgenic or deficient for 
      apoptosis-related genes, we determined that polyQ-AR apoptotic activation is 
      fully dependent on Bax. Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was required for apoptotic 
      pathway activation through phosphorylation of c-Jun. Expression of polyQ-AR in 
      DP5/Hrk null neurons yielded significant protection against apoptotic activation, 
      but absence of Bim did not provide protection, apparently due to compensatory 
      upregulation of DP5/Hrk or other BH3-only proteins. Misfolded AR protein in the 
      cytosol thus initiates a cascade of events beginning with JNK and culminating in 
      Bax-dependent, intrinsic pathway activation, mediated in part by DP5/Hrk. As 
      apoptotic mediators are candidates for toxic fragment generation and other 
      cellular processes linked to neuron dysfunction, delineation of the apoptotic 
      activation pathway induced by polyQ-expanded AR may shed light on the pathogenic 
      cascade in SBMA and other motor neuron diseases.

TI  - Relationship between the CAG repeat polymorphism in the androgen receptor gene 
      and acne in the Han ethnic group.
PG  - 302-6
LID - 10.1159/000202983 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The modulatory domain of the human androgen receptor (AR) gene 
      contains a polymorphic CAG repeat coding for a polyglutamine tract which is 
      inversely correlated with transcriptional activity of the AR. Androgens acting 
      through the AR play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of acne vulgaris. We 
      therefore investigated the relationship between CAG repeat polymorphism in the AR 
      gene and acne susceptibility. METHODS: 206 acne patients and 200 controls 
      participated in the study. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood 
      lymphocytes of individual patients, and the CAG repeat region was amplified by 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using fluorescence-labeled primers. Samples were 
      then run on an ABI 377 gene scan analysis gel with an internal molecular-weight 
      marker. Ten male samples were chosen randomly for sequencing to confirm the 
      number of CAG repeats. The 2-sample independent t test was used to analyze the 
      data. RESULTS: The mean number of the CAG repeat in the AR was 22.07 (14-28) in 
      the controls and 20.61 (13-26) in the male acne group. There was a significant 
      correlation between the CAG repeat length and male acne. No significant 
      difference was observed between female patients and their controls. CONCLUSION: 
      The results suggest that the AR gene CAG repeat polymorphism may be one of the 
      candidate genetic markers for male acne susceptibility in the Han population.

TI  - Recovery of function in a myogenic mouse model of spinal bulbar muscular atrophy.
PG  - 113-20
LID - 10.1016/j.nbd.2008.12.009 [doi]
AB  - With this paper, we deliberately challenge the prevailing neurocentric theory of 
      the etiology of spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). We offer data supporting 
      an alternative view that androgen receptor (AR) acts in skeletal muscles to cause 
      the symptoms of SBMA. While SBMA has been linked to a CAG repeat expansion in the 
      AR gene and mutant AR is presumed to act in motoneurons to cause SBMA, we find 
      that over-expression of wild type AR solely in skeletal muscle fibers results in 
      the same androgen-dependent disease phenotype as when mutant AR is broadly 
      expressed. Like other recent SBMA mouse models, transgenic (tg) females in our 
      model exhibit a motor phenotype only when exposed to androgens, and this motor 
      dysfunction is independent of motoneuronal or muscle fiber cell death. Muscles 
      from symptomatic females also show denervation-like changes in gene expression 
      comparable to a knock-in model of SBMA. Furthermore, once androgen treatment 
      ends, tg females rapidly recover motor function and muscle gene expression, 
      demonstrating the strict androgen-dependence of the disease phenotype in our 
      model. Our results argue that SBMA may be caused by AR acting in muscle.

AB  - The metabolic syndrome (MS) includes a clustering of metabolic derangements. Low 
      testosterone levels have been shown to be associated with both components of MS 
      and MS per se. As most androgen-related effects are mediated thorough the 
      androgen receptor (AR), we wanted to investigate to which degree the AR CAG and 
      GGN repeat polymorphisms might be related to MS. Sixty-eight men, 60-80 years 
      old, with subnormal total testosterone levels (<or=11.0 nmol/L) and 104 men with 
      normal levels (>11.0 nmol/L), participating in a nested case-control study were 
      investigated in this study. Body weight, height, waist circumferences and blood 
      pressure were measured. Fasting blood samples were drawn and an oral glucose 
      tolerance test (OGTT) was performed. The CAG and GGN polymorphisms in the AR gene 
      were determined by direct sequencing of leucocyte DNA. Men with MS had lower CAG 
      repeat number than healthy men (p = 0.007). There were, however, no difference in 
      CAG or GGN repeats length between the groups with subnormal or normal 
      testosterone concentrations. In cross-sectional analyses, men with CAG repeat 
      lengths <or= 21 had significantly higher fasting glucose, C-peptide and 
      glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels (all p < 0.05). In multiple regression 
      analyses, CAG repeat length was an inverse and independent predictor of glucose 
      after an OGTT and of HbA1c levels. We also found that men with more than one 
      component of MS had shorter CAG repeat number (p for trend 0.013) than those with 
      only one component. In conclusion, there were no associations with GGN repeat 
      length, while short CAG repeat length seems to be associated with increased risk 
      of MS.

TI  - Androgens inhibit androgen receptor promoter activation in motor neurons.
PG  - 395-404
LID - 10.1016/j.nbd.2008.11.007 [doi]
AB  - The androgen receptor (AR), a ligand-activated transcription factor, has been 
      found mutated in several human diseases. While some mutations reduce, others 
      potentiate AR functions generating different endocrine dysfunctions. A peculiar 
      AR mutation, the CAG-repeat expansion encoding the AR-polyglutamine (polyQ) 
      tract, generates a neurotoxic gain-of-function(s) in this mutant AR (ARpolyQ). 
      This leads to the motor neuronal disease Spinal and Bulbar Muscular Atrophy 
      (SBMA), in which the transcriptional AR down-regulation might have beneficial 
      impacts. We thus analysed the AR-promoter/5'-UTR activation and androgenic 
      regulation, demonstrating that its constitutive activity is considerably high in 
      motor neurons (NSC34). Testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), but not 
      estradiol, inhibited AR promoter activation. Thus AR establishes a negative 
      control on its own functions, in opposition to that described on classical 
      androgen-responsive elements (ARE) of the AR gene. The AR/DNA interaction is 
      required for this action, since DHT does not inhibit AR expression in presence of 
      an AR (AR_DeltaPhe581) lacking DNA binding activity. The minimal inhibitory 
      region spans from -740/+570 bp, where "in silico" analysis showed a putative AR 
      binding site; deletion studies excluded that this ARE may be involved in this 
      inhibition. A similar effect of DHT has also been observed in AR negative 
      prostate cancer DU145 cell line transfected with the AR. Moreover, androgens 
      down-regulate the expression of the endogenous AR gene in an AR positive prostate 
      cancer LNCaP cell line. Interestingly, in immortalized motor neurons, ARpolyQ was 
      much less effective than wtAR on the positive androgenic control on classical 
      AREs, while ARpolyQ and wtAR had similar inhibitory properties on the AR 
      promoter/5'-UTR activation. This strongly suggests that, in motor neurons, the 
      two types of AR gene androgenic regulation involve different mechanisms. Thus, by 
      acting on the AR promoter it would be possible to reduce AR levels in motor 
      neurons, providing novel approaches to treat SBMA.

TI  - Short alleles of both GGN and CAG repeats at the exon-1 of the androgen receptor 
      gene are associated to increased PSA staining and a higher Gleason score in human 
      prostatic cancer.
PG  - 85-91
LID - 10.1016/j.jsbmb.2008.11.010 [doi]
AB  - The exon 1 of the human androgen receptor (AR) gene contains two length 
      polymorphisms of CAG (polyglutamine) and GGN (polyglycine). "In vitro" 
      experiments suggest that the larger GGN repeats provide a lower AR-protein yield, 
      whereas the larger CAG repeats decrease the AR transcriptional activity, both 
      decreasing the AR signalling intensity. Here we have tested such possibilities in 
      human prostatic cancer (CaP) specimens. We used 72 archival samples of radical 
      prostatectomy. Parallel slides were used for AR protein or PSA 
      immunohistochemistry, and for genotyping studies. Polymorphisms were genotyped by 
      PCR, fragment length analysis and sequencing selected samples. The AR staining 
      was positively correlated with the Gleason score (r=0.320; P=0.005), but it was 
      not correlated to CAG or GGN repeat length or PSA staining. The number of GGN 
      repeats was negatively correlated to the intensity of PSA staining (r=-0.243; 
      P=0.04). Combination of short alleles of both tracts was significantly higher in: 
      the heavier stained tertiles for PSA (P=0.03) and AR (P=0.06); and in the 
      subgroup of samples having a Gleason score of 7 or higher (P=0.021). The results 
      support the hypothesis that the shorter alleles of CAG and GGN repeats in the AR 
      gene are associated to an increased AR signalling intensity in human prostate 
      cancer, and with more aggressive forms of the disease.

TI  - Somatic mosaicism of androgen receptor CAG repeats in colorectal carcinoma 
      epithelial cells from men.
PG  - 38-44
LID - 10.1016/j.jss.2008.05.013 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The X-linked human androgen receptor gene (AR) contains an exonic 
      polymorphic trinucleotide CAG. The length of this encoded CAG tract inversely 
      affects AR transcriptional activity. Colorectal carcinoma is known to express the 
      androgen receptor, but data on somatic CAG repeat lengths variations in malignant 
      and normal epithelial cells are still sporadic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using 
      laser capture microdissection (LCM), epithelial cells from colorectal carcinoma 
      and normal-appearing mucosa were collected from the fresh tissue of eight 
      consecutive male patients undergoing surgery (mean age, 70 y; range, 54-82). DNA 
      isolated from each LCM sample underwent subsequent PCR and DNA sequencing to 
      precisely determine AR CAG repeat lengths and the presence of microsatellite 
      instability (MSI). RESULTS: Different AR CAG repeat lengths were observed in 
      colorectal carcinoma (ranging from 0 to 36 CAG repeats), mainly in the form of 
      multiple shorter repeat lengths. This genetic heterogeneity (somatic mosaicism) 
      was also found in normal-appearing colorectal mucosa. Half of the carcinoma cases 
      examined tended to have a higher number of AR CAG repeat lengths with a wider 
      range of repeat size variation compared to normal mucosa. MSI carcinomas tended 
      to have longer median AR CAG repeat lengths (n = 17) compared to microsatellite 
      stable carcinomas (n = 14), although the difference was not significant (P = 
      0.31, Mann-Whitney test). CONCLUSIONS: Multiple unique somatic mutations of the 
      AR CAG repeats occur in colorectal mucosa and in carcinoma, predominantly 
      resulting in shorter alleles. Colorectal epithelial cells carrying AR alleles 
      with shorter CAG repeat lengths may be more androgen-sensitive and therefore have 
      a growth advantage.

TI  - Androgen receptor repeat length polymorphism associated with male-to-female 
      transsexualism.
PG  - 93-6
LID - 10.1016/j.biopsych.2008.08.033 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a likely genetic component to transsexualism, and genes 
      involved in sex steroidogenesis are good candidates. We explored the specific 
      hypothesis that male-to-female transsexualism is associated with gene variants 
      responsible for undermasculinization and/or feminization. Specifically, we 
      assessed the role of disease-associated repeat length polymorphisms in the 
      androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta), and aromatase (CYP19) 
      genes. METHODS: Subject-control analysis included 112 male-to-female transsexuals 
      and 258 non-transsexual males. Associations and interactions were investigated 
      between CAG repeat length in the AR gene, CA repeat length in the ERbeta gene, 
      and TTTA repeat length in the CYP19 gene and male-to-female transsexualism. 
      RESULTS: A significant association was identified between transsexualism and the 
      AR allele, with transsexuals having longer AR repeat lengths than non-transsexual 
      male control subjects (p=.04). No associations for transsexualism were evident in 
      repeat lengths for CYP19 or ERbeta genes. Individuals were then classified as 
      short or long for each gene polymorphism on the basis of control median 
      polymorphism lengths in order to further elucidate possible combined effects. No 
      interaction associations between the three genes and transsexualism were 
      identified. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that male gender identity 
      might be partly mediated through the androgen receptor.

PG  - 1380-4
LID - 10.1111/j.1939-1676.2008.0181.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Relatively shorter lengths of the polymorphic polyglutamine repeat-1 
      of the androgen receptor (AR) have been associated with an increased risk of 
      prostate cancer (PC) in humans. In the dog, there are 2 polymorphic CAG repeat 
      (CAGr) regions. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship of CAGr length of the 
      canine AR-gene and the development of PC. ANIMALS: Thirty-two dogs with PC and 
      172 control dogs were used. METHODS: DNA was extracted from blood. Both CAG 
      repeats were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR products were 
      sequenced. RESULTS: In dogs with PC, CAG-1 repeat length was shorter (P = .001) 
      by an increased proportion of 10 repeats (P = .011) and no 12 repeats (P = .0017) 
      than in the control dogs. No significant changes were found in CAG-3 length 
      distribution. CAG-1 and CAG-3 polymorphisms proved not to be in linkage 
      disequilibrium. Breed difference in allelic distribution was found in the control 
      group. Of the prostate-disease sensitive breeds, a high percentage (64.5%) of the 
      shortest haplotype 10/11 was found in the Doberman, whereas Beagles and German 
      Pointers had higher haplotype 12/11 (47.1 and 50%). Bernese Mountain dogs and 
      Bouvier dogs both shared a high percentage of 11 CAG-1 repeats and 13 CAG-3 
      repeats. Differences in (combined) allelic distributions among breeds were not 
      significant. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: In this preliminary study, 
      short CAG-1 repeats in the AR-gene were associated with an increased risk of 
      developing canine PC. Although breed-specific differences in allelic distribution 
      of CAG-1 and CAG-3 repeats were found, these could not be related to PC risk.

TI  - Consequences of poly-glutamine repeat length for the conformation and folding of 
      the androgen receptor amino-terminal domain.
PG  - 301-14
LID - 10.1677/JME-08-0042 [doi]
AB  - Poly-amino acid repeats, especially long stretches of glutamine (Q), are common 
      features of transcription factors and cell-signalling proteins and are prone to 
      expansion, resulting in neurodegenerative diseases. The amino-terminal domain of 
      the androgen receptor (AR-NTD) has a poly-Q repeat between 9 and 36 residues, 
      which when it expands above 40 residues results in spinal bulbar muscular 
      atrophy. We have used spectroscopy and biochemical analysis to investigate the 
      structural consequences of an expanded repeat (Q45) or removal of the repeat 
      (DeltaQ) on the folding of the AR-NTD. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed 
      that in aqueous solution, the AR-NTD has a relatively limited amount of stable 
      secondary structure. Expansion of the poly-Q repeat resulted in a modest increase 
      in alpha-helix structure, while deletion of the repeat resulted in a small loss 
      of alpha-helix structure. These effects were more pronounced in the presence of 
      the structure-promoting solvent trifluoroethanol or the natural osmolyte 
      trimethylamine N-oxide. Fluorescence spectroscopy showed that the 
      microenvironments of four tryptophan residues were also altered after the 
      deletion of the Q stretch. Other structural changes were observed for the 
      AR-NTDQ45 polypeptide after limited proteolysis; in addition, this polypeptide 
      not only showed enhanced binding of the hydrophobic probe 
      8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulphonic acid but was more sensitive to urea-induced 
      unfolding. Taken together, these findings support the view that the presence and 
      length of the poly-Q repeat modulate the folding and structure of the AR-NTD.

TI  - Androgen receptor gene CAG repeat length in women with metabolic syndrome.
PG  - 411-6
LID - 10.1080/09513590802210865 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The length of the androgen receptor gene CAG repeat [AR (CAG)(n)] 
      modulates the activity of the androgen receptor (AR), and this polymorphism has 
      been shown to modulate body fat mass and serum concentrations of insulin in men. 
      We hypothesized that shorter AR (CAG)(n) is associated with metabolic syndrome 
      (MBS) or its components in women. DESIGN, PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS: In a 
      cross-sectional controlled study we studied 52 Finnish women aged 34-55 years 
      with MBS and 69 age-matched controls. All participants were recruited from a 
      sample of women drawn from the Finnish population register. We compared the mean 
      AR (CAG)(n) in the two groups. Furthermore, we correlated the AR (CAG)(n) with 
      serum testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and several 
      parameters of glucose and lipid metabolism in each group and in all 121 women. 
      RESULTS: There was no difference in the biallelic mean AR (CAG)(n) between the 
      MBS and the control group (21.6+/-0.2 vs. 21.8+/-0.2, not significant). The AR 
      (CAG)(n) did not correlate significantly with any of the clinical or biochemical 
      parameters of glucose or fat metabolism. However, it correlated negatively with 
      serum testosterone (-0.195, p = 0.04) and androstenedione concentrations (-0.205, 
      p = 0.03) in all studied women. CONCLUSIONS: The AR (CAG)(n) is not a major 
      determinant of MBS in women but it contributes to ovarian androgen production.

TI  - Walking capacity evaluated by the 6-minute walk test in spinal and bulbar 
      muscular atrophy.
PG  - 964-71
LID - 10.1002/mus.21077 [doi]
AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an adult-onset motor neuron disease 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the androgen receptor gene. Because the 
      progression of SBMA is slow, it is plausible to identify biomarkers that monitor 
      disease course for therapeutic development. To verify whether the 6-min walk test 
      (6MWT) is a biomarker of SBMA, we performed the 6MWT in 35 genetically confirmed 
      patients and in 29 age-matched healthy controls. The walk distance covered within 
      6 min (6MWD) was significantly less in SBMA than it was in controls (323.3 +/- 
      143.9 m and 637.6 +/- 94.2 m, respectively; P < 0.001). In test-retest analysis, 
      the intraclass correlation coefficient for the 6MWD was high in SBMA patients (r 
      = 0.982). In a 1-year follow-up the 6MWD significantly decreased at a rate of 
      11.3% per year. Our observations suggest that the 6MWT is a biomarker that can be 
      used to monitor progression of motor impairment in SBMA.

TI  - Combination of short CAG and GGN repeats in the androgen receptor gene is 
      associated with acne risk in North East China.
PG  - 1445-51
LID - 10.1111/j.1468-3083.2008.02891.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acne vulgaris is one of the most common skin disorders, and androgen 
      is known to play a key role in the development of acne. However, the exact 
      genetic mechanism by which androgen receptor (AR) gene affects acne development 
      is still unclear. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to investigate whether CAG and GGN 
      polymorphism of the AR gene are associated with acne risk. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      Two hundred thirty-eight patients and 207 controls were included in the study. 
      The repeat lengths of the AR gene were determined by GeneScan analysis. RESULTS: 
      Men with CAG < 23 and women with CAG < 24 had significant risk compared to those 
      men with CAG > or = 23 [odds ratio (OR), 2.07; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 
      1.21-3.54] and women with CAG > or = 24 (OR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.18-3.56). In males, 
      GGN repeats, considered independently of the CAG repeat, have no significant 
      effect on the acne risk; however, when combined with CAG repeats, the acne 
      patients exhibited significantly higher frequency of the haplotypes CAG < 23/GGN 
      < or = 23 (OR, 3.33; 95% CI, 1.10-10.07; P < 0.05) compared with the controls. 
      CONCLUSION: Our results of this study strongly indicated that a shorter CAG 
      repeat length and specific haplotypes of AR attributed to the risk of acne 
      development and thus could serve as a susceptibility marker.

      baumannii strains.
PG  - 11-7
AB  - In search of an effective DNA typing technique for Acinetobacter baumannii 
      strains for hospital epidemiology use, the performance and convenience of a new 
      target sequence was evaluated. Using known genomic sequences of Acinetobacter 
      baumannii strains AR 319754 and ATCC 17978, we developed single-locus 
      variable-number direct-repeat analysis using polymerase chain 
      reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (DR-PCR/RFLP) method. A total 
      of 90 Acinetobacter baumannii strains isolated from patients of the Clinical 
      Hospital in Bydgoszcz, Poland, were examined. Initially, all strains were typed 
      using macrorestriction analysis of the chromosomal DNA by pulsed-field gel 
      electrophoresis (REA-PFGE). Digestion of the chromosomal DNA with the ApaI 
      endonuclease and separation of the fragments by PFGE revealed 21 unique types. 
      Application of DR-PCR/RFLP resulted in recognition of 12 clusters. The results 
      showed that the DR-PCR/RFLP method is less discriminatory than REA-PFGE, however, 
      the novel genotyping method can be used as an alternative technique for 
      generating DNA profiles in epidemiological studies of intra-species genetic 
      relatedness of Acinetobacter baumannii strains.

TI  - Rare association of antisynthetase syndrome and Kennedy's disease.
PG  - 1329-31
LID - 10.1007/s10067-008-0946-5 [doi]
AB  - Antisynthetase syndrome is a type of Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathy (IIM) 
      associated with anti-Jo1 antibody. Kennedy's disease or X-linked spinal and 
      bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a rare neuromuscular disease. We describe the 
      case report of a 53-year-old man who presented with proximal muscle weakness and 
      a history of bilateral hand tremor. Initial physical examination demonstrated 
      "mechanic's hands", Raynaud's phenomenon, having elevated creatine kinase and 
      lactate dehydrogenase levels and anti-Jo1 antibody positivity. His muscle biopsy 
      demonstrated inflammatory infiltrate characteristic of IIM. Considering these 
      findings, we reached the diagnosis of antisynthetase syndrome and commenced 
      immunosuppressive therapy. On follow-up examination, he had developed dysphagia, 
      and his tremor had worsened. His electroneurogram result was characteristic of 
      Kennedy's disease, and the genetic test result showed an allele with 44 CAG 
      repeat expansion in the androgen receptor gene of the X chromosome. This 
      confirmed that in addition to antisynthetase syndrome, he also had Kennedy's 
      disease. This patient now receives immunology and neurology follow-up. His 
      symptoms have improved with low dose corticosteroids, propranolol for tremor, 
      vitamin B supplementation, and physiotherapy. This article presents a rare case 
      report of a patient with concurrent antisynthetase syndrome and Kennedy's 
      disease, both of which lead to elevated creatine kinase levels and muscle 
      weakness, thus, underpinning the importance of careful follow-up of patients with 
      IIM and maintaining an open mind to other diagnoses when faced with refractory 
      and/or new symptoms.

PG  - 392-5
LID - 10.1080/00313020801911496 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The purpose of this study was to elucidate the clonality of fibrous 
      dysplasia based on X-chromosome inactivation mosaicism and polymorphism in female 
      somatic cells at the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) and androgen receptor (AR) 
      loci using microdissection technology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine patients with 
      fibrous dysplasia were examined using clonality assays based on X-chromosome 
      inactivation mosaicism. Lesions and surrounding soft tissues were microdissected 
      from paraffin sections, and genomic DNA was extracted, pretreated with Hpa II or 
      Hha I, and the PGK and AR genes were amplified by nested PCR. The single 
      nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at the PGK locus was identified by incubation with 
      Bst XI and agarose gel electrophoresis. The CAG repeat length polymorphism at the 
      AR locus was revealed on denaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualised by silver 
      staining. RESULT: Microscopically, typical histological characteristics were seen 
      in each sample. Lesions consisted of varying proportions of fibrous tissue and 
      immature trabecular bone. Tissue consisted of collagenous fibres and fish-hook or 
      comma-shaped trabecular bone without rows of cuboidal appositional osteoblasts on 
      the surface. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of AR was found in 
      seven of nine cases. The results of clonality assays demonstrated that seven 
      cases of fibrous dysplasia were monoclonal, suggesting that they are neoplastic 
      lesions. CONCLUSION: We conclude that fibrous dysplasia may not be a hyperplastic 
      lesion, but a neoplastic lesion. Additional studies with larger sample sizes will 
      be needed to conclusively prove our hypothesis.

PG  - 367-72
LID - 10.1007/s00414-008-0225-7 [doi]
AB  - Androgens mediate their functions through androgen receptors (AR). The two 
      triplet repeats in the AR gene (CAG and GGN) are highly polymorphic among various 
      populations and have been extensively studied in diverse clinical conditions and 
      antisocial personality disorders. Several studies have reported either higher 
      levels of testosterone among rapists or the correlation of shorter CAG repeats 
      with criminal activities. However, to date, no study has analyzed AR gene in 
      rapists worldwide, and no study has been conducted on criminals from Indian 
      subcontinent. Therefore, we have analyzed the AR-CAG repeat length in 645 men, of 
      which 241 were convicted for rape, 107 for murder, 26 for both murder and rape, 
      and 271 were control males. The aim was to explore if there was any correlation 
      between CAG repeat length and criminal behavior. The study revealed significantly 
      shorter CAG repeats in the rapists (mean 18.44 repeats) and murderers (mean 17.59 
      repeats) compared to the control men (mean 21.19 repeats). The criminals who 
      committed murder after rape had a far shorter mean repeat length (mean 17.31 
      repeats) in comparison to the controls or those convicted of rape or murder 
      alone. In short, our study suggests that the reduced CAG repeats in the AR gene 
      are associated with criminal behavior. This, along with other studies, would help 
      in understanding the biological factors associated with the antisocial or 
      criminal activities.

TI  - Genetic variation of the androgen receptor and risk of myocardial infarction and 
      ischemic stroke in women.
PG  - 1590-2
LID - 10.1161/STROKEAHA.107.508218 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Androgen receptors (AR) are expressed in endothelial 
      cells and vascular smooth-muscle cells. Some studies suggest an association 
      between AR gene variation and risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in men; 
      however, the relationship has not been examined in women. METHODS: Six haplotype 
      block-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs962458, rs6152, rs1204038, 
      rs2361634, rs1337080, rs1337082), as well as the cysteine, adenine, guanine (CAG) 
      microsatellite in exon 1, of the AR gene were evaluated among 300 white 
      postmenopausal women who developed CVD (158 myocardial infarctions and 142 
      ischemic strokes) and an equal number of matched controls within the Women's 
      Health Study. RESULTS: Genotype distributions were similar between cases and 
      controls, and genotypes were not significantly related to risk of CVD, myocardial 
      infarctions or ischemic stroke in conditional logistic regression models. Seven 
      common haplotypes were observed, but distributions did not differ between cases 
      and controls nor were significant associations observed in logistic regression 
      analysis. The median CAG repeat length was 21. In conditional logistic 
      regression, there was no association between the number of alleles with CAG 
      repeat length >or=21 (or >or=22) and risk of CVD, myocardial infarctions or 
      ischemic stroke. CONCLUSIONS: No association between AR genetic variation, as 
      measured by haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms and CAG repeat 
      number, and risk of CVD was observed in women.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of different numbers of repeats of the AR. DESIGN: 
      Experimental study. SETTING: A university in Thailand. PATIENT(S): Nucleic acid 
      sequences of the general male population. INTERVENTION(S): A new Gene Ontology 
      technology to predict the aberration of the molecular function of the AR as a 
      result of different numbers of repeats of CAG. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Molecular 
      function. RESULT(S): Repeats of CAG up to 127 times cause no effect on expression 
      of AR in molecular function. Indeed, there have been limited reports on the 
      number of repeats and correlation to clinical phenotypes. CONCLUSION(S): The 
      number of repeats is very high, and there has been no prior report indicating as 
      many repeats as we found. Therefore, the CAG repeat polymorphism in AR appears to 
      be a nonsignificant polymorphism in affecting gross phenotype.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of the androgen receptor (AR) gene CAG repeat in 
      women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). DESIGN: Case control study. SETTING: 
      University department of obstetrics and gynecology. PATIENT(S): Women with (n = 
      114) or without (n = 205) PCOS. INTERVENTION(S): Peripheral blood sampling was 
      done for DNA analysis and serum hormone measurements. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): 
      CAG repeat length and serum androgen levels. RESULT(S): No statistically 
      significant CAG repeat length differences were found between patients and 
      controls. We conducted a detailed analysis after dividing PCOS patients according 
      to their free testosterone levels. The high free testosterone group had a 
      statistically significantly longer mean biallelic average (24.0 +/- 2.0 vs. 23.0 
      +/- 1.5), short (22.5 +/- 1.8 vs. 21.7 +/- 1.9), and long (25.5 +/- 2.9 vs. 24.4 
      +/- 1.9) allelic lengths than the normal free testosterone group. In PCOS 
      patients, a statistically significant correlation was found between biallelic 
      average length and free testosterone concentration, either unadjusted or after 
      adjustment. CONCLUSION(S): The AR gene CAG repeat polymorphism may contribute to 
      the serum concentration of free testosterone in PCOS patients. A subset of PCOS 
      patients with relatively longer CAG repeats (less AR activity) tended to show a 
      higher serum androgen concentration.

TI  - Polymorphic CAG and GGC repeat lengths in the androgen receptor gene and prostate 
      cancer risk: analysis of a Brazilian population.
PG  - 74-80
LID - 10.1080/07357900701638251 [doi]
AB  - Variations in transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor (AR) are related 
      to polymorphic CAG and GGC repeats in exon 1 of the AR gene. We investigated the 
      association between CAG and GGC repeat length and the risk of prostate cancer in 
      a case-control study from a Brazilian population. We evaluated 49 patients and 51 
      healthy controls. DNA was extracted from peripheral leukocytes and the AR gene 
      was analyzed by fragment analysis (GeneMapper software, Applied Biosystems, 
      Foster City, California, USA). CAG and GGC mean lengths were not different 
      between cases and controls. The risk for prostate cancer was higher for CAG 
      repeats < or = 21 (OR = 2.44 [95% CI 1.03-5.81]) as well as for total repeat 
      lengths (CAG + GGC) < or = 37 (OR = 2.46 [95% CI 0.98-6.18]). GGC repeats (< or = 
      17 and > 17) were not associated with risk for prostate cancer (OR = 1.13 [95% CI 
      0.47-2.75]). In conclusion, fewer number of CAG repeats and total repeats (CAG + 
      GGC) in the AR gene may be associated with increased risk for prostate cancer.

TI  - Androgen insensitivity syndrome: do trinucleotide repeats in androgen receptor 
      gene have any role?
PG  - 616-24
AB  - AIM: To investigate the role of CAG and GGN repeats as genetic background 
      affecting androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) phenotype. METHODS: We analyzed 
      lengths of androgen receptor (AR)-CAG and GGN repeats in 69 AIS cases, along with 
      136 unrelated normal male individuals. The lengths of repeats were analyzed using 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification followed by allelic genotyping to 
      determine allele length. RESULTS: Our study revealed significantly shorter mean 
      lengths of CAG repeats in patients (mean 18.25 repeats, range 14-26 repeats) in 
      comparison to the controls (mean 22.57 repeats, range 12-39 repeats) (two-tailed 
      P < 0.0001). GGN repeats, however, did not differ significantly between patients 
      (mean 21.48 repeats) and controls (mean 21.21 repeats) (two-tailed P = 0.474). 
      Among patients' groups, the mean number of CAG repeats in partial androgen 
      insensitivity cases (mean 15.83 repeats) was significantly less than in complete 
      androgen insensitivity cases (mean 19.46 repeats) (two-tailed P < 0.0001). 
      CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that shorter lengths of repeats in the AR gene 
      might act as low penetrance genetic background in varying manifestation of 
      androgen insensitivity.

TI  - A comparison of the lengths of androgen receptor triplet repeats in brain and 
      blood in motor neuron diseases.
PG  - 125-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Expansions of triplet repeats are found in a number of 
      neurodegenerative conditions, and different tissues in the same person can have 
      varying repeat lengths. In Kennedy disease, motor neuron loss is due to expansion 
      of the CAG repeat length in the androgen receptor gene (AR). We hypothesised that 
      patients with other sporadic motor neuron diseases could have AR expansions that 
      were restricted to CNS tissue. METHODS: We measured the AR triplet repeat length 
      in DNA extracted from the brains of 23 patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (SALS) and 3 with sporadic progressive muscular atrophy (SPMA). Paired 
      blood samples were available in 15 patients to look for blood-brain differences 
      in CAG repeat length. RESULTS: No CAG expansions in the Kennedy disease range 
      were found in the SALS or SPMA brains. Furthermore, no brain-blood differences 
      were found in the lengths of AR triplet repeats. Brain AR repeat length was not 
      associated with the duration, or age or site of onset, of disease. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The findings indicate that a brain-specific expansion of AR triplet repeats is 
      unlikely to underlie motor neuron loss in SALS or SPMA.

TI  - Pathophysiologic insights into motor axonal function in Kennedy disease.
PG  - 1828-35
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Kennedy disease (KD), or spinobulbomuscular atrophy, is a slowly 
      progressive inherited neurodegenerative disorder, marked by prominent 
      fasciculations that typically precede the development of other symptoms. Although 
      the genetic basis of KD relates to triplet (CAG) repeat expansion in the androgen 
      receptor (AR) gene on the X chromosome, the mechanisms underlying the clinical 
      presentation in KD have yet to be established. Consequently, the present study 
      applied axonal excitability techniques to investigate the pathophysiologic 
      mechanisms associated with KD. METHODS: Peripheral nerve excitability studies 
      were undertaken in 7 patients with KD with compound muscle action potentials 
      (CMAP) recorded from the right abductor pollicis brevis. RESULTS: 
      Strength-duration time constant (KD 0.54 +/- 0.03 msec; controls, 0.41 +/- 0.02 
      msec, p < 0.01) and the hyperpolarizing current/threshold gradient (KD 0.42 +/- 
      0.01; controls, 0.37 +/- 0.01, p < 0.05) were significantly increased in KD. 
      Strength-duration time constant correlated with the CMAP amplitude (R = 0.68) and 
      the fasciculation frequency (R = 0.62). Threshold electrotonus revealed greater 
      changes in response to subthreshold depolarizing (KD TEd [90 to 100 msec], 50.75 
      +/- 1.98%; controls TEd [90 to 100 msec], 45.67 +/- 0.67%, p < 0.01) and 
      hyperpolarizing (KD TEh [90 to 100 msec], 128.5 +/- 6.9%; controls TEh [90 to 100 
      msec], 120.5 +/- 2.4%) conditioning pulses. Measurements of refractoriness, 
      superexcitability, and late subexcitability changed appropriately for axonal 
      hyperpolarization, perhaps reflecting the effects of increased ectopic activity. 
      CONCLUSION: In total, the increase in the strength-duration time constant may be 
      the primary event, occurring early in course of the disease, contributing to the 
      development of axonal hyperexcitability in Kennedy disease, and thereby to the 
      generation of fasciculations, a characteristic hallmark of the disease.

TI  - Overexpression of wild-type androgen receptor in muscle recapitulates 
      polyglutamine disease.
PG  - 18259-64
AB  - We created transgenic mice that overexpress WT androgen receptor (AR) exclusively 
      in their skeletal muscle fibers. Unexpectedly, these mice display 
      androgen-dependent muscle weakness and early death, show changes in muscle 
      morphology and gene expression consistent with neurogenic atrophy, and exhibit a 
      loss of motor axons. These features reproduce those seen in models of Kennedy 
      disease, a polyglutamine expansion disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in 
      the AR gene. These findings demonstrate that toxicity in skeletal muscles is 
      sufficient to cause motoneuron disease and indicate that overexpression of the WT 
      AR can exert toxicity comparable with the polyglutamine expanded protein. This 
      model has two clear implications for Kennedy disease: (i) mechanisms affecting AR 
      gene expression may cause neuromuscular symptoms similar to those of Kennedy 
      disease and (ii) therapeutic approaches targeting skeletal muscle may provide 
      effective treatments for this disease.

TI  - The androgen receptor CAG repeat length polymorphism associates with prostate 
      volume in Finnish men with benign prostatic hyperplasia.
PG  - 109-13
AB  - The development of benign prostatic hyperplasia requires the presence of 
      testicular androgens during prostate development, puberty, and ageing. We thus 
      examined the association of three polymorphisms, namely, CYP3A5 6986A>G, CYP19A1 
      1531C>T, and androgen receptor (AR) gene CAG repeat length, which have previously 
      been linked to the androgen pathway and with clinical characteristics of benign 
      prostatic hyperplasia. Tissue samples from 262 consecutive prostate operations 
      were used for genotyping. Prostate volumes and prostate-specific antigen values 
      were collected from patient records. Linear regression analysis was performed to 
      study the polymorphisms in an age-adjusted model. We did not find any association 
      between the CYP3A5 6986A>G polymorphism and clinical characteristics of benign 
      prostatic hyperplasia. Further, the previously published CYP19A1 1531C>T 
      polymorphism association with an enlarged prostate could not be confirmed with 
      this material. However, we detected an association between short AR gene CAG 
      repeat length and a small prostate volume, which confirms a previous finding in 
      the Finnish population. The data presented suggest a negligible role for the 
      CYP3A5 6986A>G polymorphism in benign prostate enlargement in the Finnish 
      population. However, the results presented do provide further evidence for 
      potentially different genetic mechanisms behind benign prostatic hyperplasia in 
      Finnish and other Caucasian populations. This is based on the conflicting results 
      for AR gene CAG repeat length associations with benign prostatic hyperplasia 
      found in published works.

TI  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy: skeletal muscle pathology in male patients 
      and heterozygous females.
PG  - 100-5
AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an adult form of X-linked motor 
      neuron disease caused by an expansion of a CAG repeat sequence in the first exon 
      of the androgen receptor (AR) gene. Nuclear accumulation of mutant AR with 
      expanded polyglutamines in motor neurons is a major pathogenic mechanism. To 
      characterize muscle involvement in SBMA the skeletal muscle biopsies of 8 SBMA 
      patients and 3 female carriers were studied. Six of 8 SBMA patients showed 
      myogenic changes together with the neurogenic atrophy in their muscle biopsy. 
      Myopathic abnormalities did not correlate with disease duration and were more 
      prominent in the muscle of patients with an higher degree of disability. In all 
      patients plasma CK levels were more elevated than what usually occurs in 
      denervative diseases. Both neurogenic and myopathic changes were also observed in 
      female carriers. Here we suggest that myopathic changes in SBMA muscle are not 
      only related to denervation and that muscle satellite cells may have a role in 
      the pathogenesis of muscle damage.

TI  - Pure bulbar motor neuron involvement linked to an abnormal CAG repeat expansion 
      in the androgen receptor gene.
PG  - 40-2
AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an X-linked adult motor neuron 
      disorder caused by an abnormal CAG-repeat expansion in the first exon of the 
      androgen receptor gene. This disease associates progressive lower motor neuron 
      affection and endocrine disturbances. Bulbar symptoms appear usually late in the 
      clinical course but clinical heterogeneity is demonstrated. We report the case of 
      a 62-year-old male with a 10-year history of progressive bulbar involvement 
      related to an abnormal CAG-repeat expansion in the androgen receptor gene. This 
      atypical phenotype led us to discuss the role of some genetic or environmental 
      factors in SBMA.

TI  - Hyperandrogenism, mediated by obesity and receptor polymorphisms, promotes 
      aggressive epithelial ovarian cancer biology.
PG  - 420-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Epidemiologic data suggest that aberrant androgen homeostasis may 
      promote aggressive epithelial ovarian cancer biology. Hyperandrogenism results 
      from both obesity and expression of polymorphic androgen receptor (AR) 
      allelotypes harboring short cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat sequences; both 
      have been shown to independently correlate with poor overall survival in ovarian 
      cancer. We have hypothesized that the combination of these factors further 
      manifests an aggressive ovarian cancer phenotype. METHODS: Genotype analysis of 
      the AR CAG polymorphism was performed on 81 patients with papillary serous 
      epithelial ovarian cancer. Medical records were reviewed for body mass index 
      (BMI), clinico-pathologic factors, and survival. Data were examined using the 
      Fishers exact test, Kaplan-Meier survival, and Cox regression analyses. RESULTS: 
      Overweight or obese women (BMI > or = 25) with a short AR allele (< or = 19 CAG 
      repeats) demonstrated statistically shorter progression-free survival (9 months) 
      when compared to underweight or ideal body weight women (BMI < 25) and a long AR 
      allele (> 19 CAG repeats; 26 months, p=0.0002). Overweight/obese women with a 
      short AR allele also demonstrated shorter overall survival (34 months) when 
      compared to underweight/ideal body weight women with a long AR allele (59 months, 
      p=0.036). On multivariate analyses, the combination of a short AR allele and BMI 
      > 25 was an independent poor prognostic factor after controlling for age, stage, 
      grade, optimal cytoreduction, and AR allele length and BMI independently 
      (p=0.05). CONCLUSION: These data provide further evidence that suggest that 
      hyperandrogenism promotes an aggressive epithelial ovarian cancer phenotype.

TI  - Androgen receptor gene CAG repeat length and body mass index modulate the safety 
      of long-term intramuscular testosterone undecanoate therapy in hypogonadal men.
PG  - 3844-53
AB  - CONTEXT: A reliable form of androgen substitution therapy regarding kinetics, 
      tolerance, and restoration of androgenicity is paramount in hypogonadal men. 
      Intramuscular injection of the long-acting ester testosterone undecanoate (TU) 
      offers a new modality. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess the 
      safety of TU regarding metabolic and pharmacogenetic confounders. DESIGN: This 
      was a longitudinal one-arm open observation trial. A minimum of five individual 
      assessments was a prerequisite. Putative modulators of safety parameters entering 
      regression models were nadir and/or delta total testosterone concentrations, body 
      mass index, androgen receptor (AR) gene CAG repeat length, and age. SETTING: The 
      study was conducted at an andrological outpatient clinic. PATIENTS: Patients 
      included 66 hypogonadal men (mean age 38 +/- 9.9 yr). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A 
      total of 515 data time points each related to prostate, erythropoiesis, 
      lipoproteins, and circulation during 118 treatment-years with 1000 mg TU at 10- 
      to 14-wk intervals. RESULTS: Testosterone substitution resulted in significant 
      decrements of serum levels of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, resting 
      diastolic and systolic blood pressure, and heart rate. Erythropoiesis was 
      stimulated and concentrations of high-density lipoproteincholesterol increased. 
      Parameters remained stable after four injections. No adverse effects regarding 
      the prostate were observed. Significantly increased hematocrit greater than 50% 
      was predicted by enhanced androgen action (shorter AR CAG repeats per higher 
      testosterone levels). However, insufficient androgen action (longer AR CAG 
      repeats per lower testosterone levels) caused pathological safety parameters 
      (high blood pressure, adverse lipid profiles). In addition, a body mass index 30 
      kg/m(2) or greater represents a clinically relevant factor for the occurrence of 
      all pathological safety parameters. Risk calculations for obese patients and 
      nonlinear pharmacogenetic models to tailor androgen substitution are presented. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Testosterone substitution with im TU is generally well tolerated. 
      Modifications of androgen action are due to both AR CAG repeats and testosterone 
      levels. Adverse observations are mostly seen in obese patients.

TI  - Comparison of nasal volume changes during rapid maxillary expansion using 
      acoustic rhinometry and computed tomography.
PG  - 251-5
AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare nasal volume changes using acoustic 
      rhinometry (AR) and computed tomography (CT). The subjects were 10 children (6 
      girls and 4 boys, with an age range of 12-14 years) who required rapid maxillary 
      expansion (RME) on the basis of their individual malocclusion. All patients were 
      found to have normal nasal cavities following anterior rhinoscopic examination. 
      AR and CT were undertaken at the start of treatment (t(1)) and 6 months after 
      expansion (t(2)). Volume changes due to expansion were evaluated using Wilcoxon's 
      test, and the correlation between the two methods was assessed with correlation 
      analyses. Both methods demonstrated that nasal volume significantly increased 
      following the use of RME (P<0.05). Correlation analyses showed no difference in 
      volume (P>0.05) using either of the two methods.

TI  - Evaluation of genetic variations in the androgen and estrogen metabolic pathways 
      as risk factors for sporadic and familial prostate cancer.
PG  - 969-78
AB  - Previous studies suggest that enzymes involved in the androgen metabolic pathway 
      are susceptibility factors for prostate cancer. Estrogen metabolites functioning 
      as genotoxins have also been proposed as risk factors. In this study, we 
      systematically tested the hypothesis that common genetic variations for those 
      enzymes involved in the androgen and estrogen metabolic pathways increase risk 
      for sporadic and familial prostate cancer. From these two pathways, 46 
      polymorphisms (34 single nucleotide polymorphisms, 10 short tandem repeat 
      polymorphisms, and 2 null alleles) in 25 genes were tested for possible 
      associations. Those genes tested included PRL, LHB, CYP11A1, HSD3B1, HSD3B2, 
      HSD17B2, CYP17, SRD5A2, AKR1C3, UGT2B15, AR, SHBG, and KLK3 from the androgen 
      pathway and CYP19, HSD17B1, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, COMT, GSTP1, GSTT1, GSTM1, 
      NQO1, ESR1, and ESR2 from the estrogen pathway. A case-control study design was 
      used with two sets of cases: familial cases with a strong prostate cancer family 
      history (n = 438 from 178 families) and sporadic cases with a negative prostate 
      cancer family history (n = 499). The controls (n = 493) were derived from a 
      population-based collection. Our results provide suggestive findings for an 
      association with either familial or sporadic prostate cancer with polymorphisms 
      in four genes: AKR1C3, HSD17B1, NQO1, and GSTT1. Additional suggestive findings 
      for an association with clinical variables (disease stage, grade, and/or node 
      status) were observed for single nucleotide polymorphisms in eight genes: HSD3B2, 
      SRD5A2, SHBG, ESR1, CYP1A1, CYP1B1, GSTT1, and NQO1. However, none of the 
      findings were statistically significant after appropriate corrections for 
      multiple comparisons. Given that the point estimates for the odds ratio for each 
      of these polymorphisms are <2.0, much larger sample sizes will be required for 
      confirmation.

TI  - Mutation in CEP290 discovered for cat model of human retinal degeneration.
PG  - 211-20
AB  - A mutation in the CEP290 gene is reported in a cat pedigree segregating for 
      autosomal recessive (AR) late-onset photoreceptor degeneration (rdAc). An initial 
      screen of 39 candidate genes and genomic locations failed to detect linkage to 
      cat rdAc. Linkage was ultimately established on cat B4 with 15 simple tandem 
      repeat markers (logarithm of odds [LOD] range 4.83-15.53, Theta = 0.0), in a 
      region demonstrating conserved synteny to human chromosome 12, 84.9-90.63 Mb. The 
      sequence of 10 genes with feline retinal expression was examined in affected and 
      unaffected individuals. A single-nucleotide polymorphism was characterized in 
      intron 50 of CEP290 (IVS50 + 9T>G) that creates a strong canonical splice donor 
      site, resulting in a 4-bp insertion and frameshift in the mRNA transcript, with 
      subsequent introduction of a stop codon and premature truncation of the protein. 
      A population genetic survey of 136 cats demonstrated that the rdAc mutation is in 
      low frequency in Abyssinian populations (0.13, Sweden; 0.07, United States) and 
      absent in breeds of non-Abyssinian heritage. Mutations in CEP290 have recently 
      been shown to cause two human diseases, Joubert syndrome, a syndromic retinal 
      degeneration, and Leber's congenital amaurosis, an AR early-onset retinal 
      dystrophy. Human AR retinitis pigmentosa is among the most common causes of 
      retinal degeneration and blindness, with no therapeutic intervention available. 
      This identification of a large animal model for human retinal blindness offers 
      considerable promise in developing gene-based therapies.

TI  - Shorter CAG repeat in the AR gene is associated with atypical hyperplasia and 
      breast carcinoma.
PG  - 1199-205
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous reports into the role of [CAG]n repeat lengths in the 
      androgen receptor (AR) gene indicate that these may play an important part in the 
      development and progression of breast cancer, however, knowledge regarding benign 
      breast lesions is limited. PATIENTS AND METHODS: PCR-based GeneScan analysis was 
      used to investigate the [CAG]n repeat length at exon 1 of the AR gene in 59 
      benign breast lesions (27 fibroadenomas, 18 atypical hyperplasias, and 14 
      hyperplasias without atypia) and 54 ductal breast carcinomas. Seventy-two 
      cancer-free women were used as a control group. In addition, [CAG]n repeats were 
      evaluated for the presence of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and microsatellite 
      instability (MSI) in a subset of these samples (27 fibroadenomas, 14 hyperplasias 
      without atypia and 22 breast carcinomas). RESULTS: Shorter [CAG]n repeat lengths 
      were strongly correlated with atypical hyperplasias (p = 0.0209) and carcinomas 
      (p < 0.0001). LOH was found in 1/12 and 4/20 informative cases of hyperplasias 
      without atypia and breast carcinomas, respectively. Three patients with breast 
      carcinoma who had previously presented atypical hyperplasia showed a reduction in 
      the [CAG]n repeat length in their carcinomas. CONCLUSION: Short [CAG]n repeat 
      length (< or = 20) polymorphisms are strongly associated with breast carcinomas 
      and atypical hyperplasias. Although non-significant, a subgroup of patients with 
      breast carcinoma and genotype SS showed an association with parameters of worse 
      outcome.

TI  - Association of tri-nucleotide (CAG and GGC) repeat polymorphism of androgen 
      receptor gene in Taiwanese women with refractory or remission rheumatoid 
      arthritis.
PG  - 2051
LID - 10.1007/s10067-007-0616-z [doi]
AB  - We investigated the relationship between CAG and GGC repeat polymorphism of the 
      androgen receptor (AR) gene and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in female patients with 
      different disease subtypes. This case-control study enrolled 215 women in three 
      groups: RA patients refractory to standardized therapy (n = 51); RA patients at 
      complete remission phase (n = 60); and healthy controls (n = 104). CAG and GGC 
      repeat lengths were determined by automated fluorescence-based DNA 
      fragment-sizing method. Demographic data, allele lengths, allele distribution, 
      and zygosity status of CAG/GGC repeats were assessed for the three groups. 
      Refractory RA patients tend to have a significantly younger onset age of RA and 
      more elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rates than do remission RA patients. Mean 
      and median values of CAG and GGC repeat lengths are similar in both RA and 
      control patients. However, RA patients harboring any long CAG alleles with more 
      than 23 repeats had an increased risk of a refractory course, whereas differences 
      in risk were not observed between these patients and RA subtypes harboring any 
      long GGC alleles with more than 16 repeats. In addition, the homozygous frequency 
      of CAG but not GGC alleles was lower in refractory RA than in remission RA 
      patients or in controls (p = 0.042). Neither CAG nor GGC repeat lengths had a 
      significant relationship with rheumatoid factor reactivity. Our observations 
      indicate that short CAG repeats of the AR gene with higher transactivation 
      activity may have protective effects against refractory course of RA development 
      and that homozygous frequency of CAG alleles may be involved in the disease 
      remission subtype. In contrast, lack of association of GGC polymorphism and RA 
      was also observed. Together, these data imply that CAG but not GGC alleles in the 
      AR polymorphism may play an important role in modulating the disease pattern of 
      RA among Taiwanese women.

TI  - Trinucleotide repeat polymorphisms in the androgen receptor gene and risk of 
      ovarian cancer.
PG  - 473-80
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Androgens may play a role in the development of ovarian cancers. 
      Two trinucleotide repeat polymorphisms have been described in exon 1 of the 
      androgen receptor (AR) gene that may affect its function. Previous studies of 
      ovarian cancer and AR repeat polymorphisms have been inconsistent. METHODS: We 
      analyzed CAG and GGC repeat length polymorphisms in the AR gene using data from a 
      population-based case-control study of ovarian cancer that included 594 cases and 
      681 controls. Repeat lengths were determined by fluorescent DNA fragment analysis 
      using ABI GeneScan software. Change point models were used to determine 
      appropriate repeat length cutoff points by race (African American versus 
      Caucasian) for both the shorter and longer CAG and GGC repeats. RESULTS: No 
      relationship was observed between CAG repeat length and ovarian cancer among 
      Caucasians. Among African Americans, having a short repeat length on either 
      allele was associated with a 2-fold increase in ovarian cancer risk (age-adjusted 
      odds ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-4.1). Having short CAG repeat 
      lengths for both alleles was associated with a 5-fold increased risk for 
      developing ovarian cancer (age-adjusted odds ratio, 5.4; 95% confidence interval, 
      1.4-1.7). No relationship with the GGC repeat length polymorphisms was observed. 
      CONCLUSION: These results suggest that having a short CAG repeat length in AR 
      increases ovarian cancer risk in African Americans. The failure to observe this 
      relationship in Caucasians may be due to the rarity of such short CAG alleles in 
      this population or could reflect racial differences in disease etiology.

TI  - Shorter CAG repeat length in the AR gene is associated with poor outcome in head 
      and neck cancer.
PG  - 732-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Alterations in the size of the [CAG](n) repeats of the AR gene have 
      been described in several types tumors. The purpose of this study was to evaluate 
      if there is an association between the AR [CAG](n) repeat alleles and the 
      relative risk for head and neck cancer and to analyse microsatellite instability 
      (MSI) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in these tumors. DESIGN: Matched samples 
      of blood and head and neck tumors were evaluated using two methodologies, 
      silver-stained gels to perform the analyses of MSI and LOH, and automated 
      analysis to confirm these results and for genotyping of the AR [CAG](n) repeat 
      length. Sixty-nine individuals without cancer were used as a control group for 
      both procedures. The Log-rank test was used to compare overall survival and 
      disease-free survival curves. The Cox proportional hazards regression models were 
      performed to determine the [CAG](n) repeats as an independent prognostic factor. 
      RESULTS: Patients with alleles <or=20 in the male group showed a correlation with 
      lower disease-free survival (P=0.0325) and with recurrence or metastasis (RR 
      2.52, CI 95%). In the female group, the allele 2 (longer allele) showed a 
      significant lower mean of [CAG](n) repeat when compared to the control group. 
      Microsatellite instability was detected in nine cases in both procedures. In six 
      out of these nine cases, we observed a reduction of the AR [CAG](n) repeat 
      length. LOH was detected in one out of 17 women informative for oral cancer in 
      both procedures. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that short [CAG](n) repeat 
      length (<or=20) polymorphism is associated with poor prognosis in a subset of 
      male patients with head and neck cancer and that AR gene microsatellite 
      instability is uncommon in these tumors.

TI  - Somatic mutations at the trinucleotide repeats of androgen receptor gene in male 
      hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 1610-7
AB  - Androgen and androgen receptor (AR) have long been implicated in liver 
      carcinogenesis, especially for the male dominance feature. However, whether AR 
      gene could occur in somatic mutations that might contribute to this process has 
      not yet been studied. DNA sequencing and genotyping were conducted for detecting 
      the genetic aberrations of AR gene in 257 primary hepatocellular carcinomas 
      (HCCs) and also the dysplastic nodules (DN) from another 11 patients. Twenty-one 
      AR somatic mutations causing amino acid changes were identified in HCC and even 
      in the precancerous DN. The missense somatic mutations of AR were rare in HCC (2 
      cases) but the trinucleotide repeat (TNR) changes, both at (CAG)n and (GGC)n, was 
      a more common one (19 cases). Notably, all these mutations occurred in male 
      patients and most TNR changes belonged to the contraction type (15 out of 19 
      cases, 78.9%), which has been reported to associate with increased AR 
      transcriptional activity. Most samples with TNR changes did not show 
      microsatellite instability, suggesting a different cause for these TNR mutations. 
      Although no significant correlation was identified between AR mutations and the 
      clinicopathologic parameters, we found the (CAG)n length significantly shorter in 
      hepatitis B virus (HBV)(+) HCCs than in HBV(-) HCCs and the (GGC)n length 
      significantly correlates with the overall survival. In conclusion, the mis-sense 
      somatic mutations of AR were rare in HCC but the TNR change was a more common 
      one, which exclusively occurred in males. Moreover, the length of TNR carried 
      clinical significance in special HCC group.

TI  - Peripheral CD4+ CD25+ Treg cell expansion in lung transplant recipients is not 
      affected by calcineurin inhibitors.
PG  - 2002-10
AB  - CD4+CD25+ regulatory T (Treg) cells have been shown to play a role in allograft 
      tolerance and their peripheral counts vary according to the degree of graft 
      acceptance in lung transplant recipients (LTR). Recent studies demonstrate that 
      certain drugs might modulate generation, expansion and activity of Treg cells. 
      Aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of therapeutic regimens used in our 
      institution on peripheral CD4+CD25(high)CD69- Treg cell numbers in a group of 51 
      LTR with stable clinical conditions. They were treated with standard 
      immunosuppression: calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)+azathioprine (AZA)+steroids (n=28) 
      or with CNI+mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)+steroids (n=11) or with CNI+steroids 
      (n=12). These stable LTR were compared with age-matched healthy controls (n=35) 
      and with 19 LTR who developed bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) and were 
      treated analogously. Stable LTR showed higher peripheral Treg cell counts with 
      respect to age-matched healthy controls (59.9+/-31.8/mul versus 42.1+/-16.9/mul, 
      respectively; p<0.05). This increase was detectable in all patients treated with 
      CNI either in association with AZA or MMF. During these treatments a significant 
      expansion of Treg cell counts was detectable during acute rejection (AR) episodes 
      (86.03+/-26.6/mul during AR versus 36.34+/-7.6 before AR; p<0,05). Moreover, the 
      development of BOS was associated to a significant decrease of Treg cell counts 
      irrespective to the immunosuppressive regimen used. In conclusion, therapeutic 
      regimens based on CNI seem to allow a certain degree of peripheral Treg cell 
      expansion in stable LTR.

TI  - Nonprogressive juvenile-onset spinal muscular atrophy: A clinico-radiological and 
      CAG repeat study of androgen receptor gene.
PG  - 24-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Occurrence of nonprogressive juvenile-onset spinal muscular atrophy 
      (SMA) predominantly in males suggests a possibility of X-linked disorder but 
      there is no such report addressing this problem. AIMS: To evaluate CAG repeat 
      expansion of androgen receptor (AR) gene in patients with nonprogressive 
      juvenile-onset SMA. SETTING: Tertiary medical teaching institute. SUBJECTS AND 
      METHODS: Patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of nonprogressive 
      juvenile-onset SMA were included. Detailed clinical evaluation and pedigree 
      charting were done in all. Nerve conduction study, electromyography and cervical 
      spinal MRI were carried out. From peripheral venous blood, DNA was separated and 
      AR gene CAG repeat exon polymorphism was assayed using polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR) in conjugation with genotyping and Gene scan soft ware. Number of CAG 
      repeats was compared with normal controls. RESULTS: 25 patients with 
      nonprogressive juvenile-onset SMA from 24 families were included and their mean 
      age was 22.2 years. Age at the time of disease onset ranged between 15 and 30 
      years with a mean duration of illness 2.6 years. None of the patients had 
      testicular atrophy or gynecomastia. C7-T1 myotomal wasting and weakness although 
      was unilateral to begin with but became bilateral in 16 and 4 more patients had 
      evidences of subclinical involvement of the other side as revealed by EMG. Spinal 
      MRI revealed cord atrophy at C6-8 vertebral level in 16 patients. CAG repeat 
      study of AR gene was carried out in 16 patients. The number of CAG repeats in 
      patients ranged between 15 and 39 (median 21) which were within the normal range. 
      CONCLUSION: Abnormal CAG repeat expansion of AR gene is not found in patients 
      with nonprogressive juvenile-onset SMA.

PG  - 873-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the size of CAG repeat in exon 1 of the androgen 
      receptor (AR) gene is related to impaired spermatogenesis in older men. DESIGN: 
      Study of two groups of older men: one with preserved spermatogenesis and the 
      other with arrested spermatogenesis. SETTING: University teaching hospital. 
      PATIENT(S): Twenty-eight men aged from 53 to 102 years. INTERVENTION(S): The DNA 
      fragment encoding the AR polyglutamine tract was amplified from DNA of testis 
      tissue. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The size of the CAG repeat was evaluated by 
      using fluorescent-labeled polymerase chain reaction performed on an ABI Prism 377 
      DNA sequencer followed by automated analysis with Genscan 3.1.2 software. 
      RESULT(S): Mean CAG repeat length was 22.76 +/- 3 in the group of 13 aged men 
      with preserved spermatogenesis and 21.86 +/- 2.23 in the group of 15 aged men 
      with arrested spermatogenesis. CONCLUSION(S): Impaired spermatogenesis in elderly 
      men does not seem to be correlated with the AR gene CAG repeat length, which 
      therefore does not appear to be a risk factor for impaired spermatogenesis in 
      older men.

TI  - Association of the polymorphisms of genes involved in androgen metabolism and 
      signaling pathways with familial prostate cancer risk in a Japanese population.
PG  - 262-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Androgen plays a central role in the normal and malignant development 
      of prostate glands. Genetic polymorphisms of genes involved in androgen 
      metabolism and signaling might be associated with the risk of prostate cancer. 
      METHODS: One hundred and two patients with prostate cancer with a family history 
      and 117 healthy age- and residence-matched male controls were enrolled. Genotypes 
      of the CAG repeat length of androgen receptor (AR), CYP17, 5alpha-reductase type 
      II (SRD5A2), UDG-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B15, PSA promoter genes were 
      analyzed. RESULTS: For single polymorphisms, the presence of Y alleles showed a 
      significantly lower risk of prostate cancer in comparison with the D/D genotype 
      in UGT2B15 (odds ratio [OR]=0.41, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.40-4.28, 
      p=0.0015), and the presence of A2 alleles showed a weak tendency to decrease 
      prostate cancer risk in comparison with the A1/A1 genotype in CYP17 (OR=0.69, 95% 
      CI=0.39-1.23, p=0.21). The stratification of cases according to clinical stage 
      and pathological grade showed that the A2/A2 genotype was significantly 
      associated with localized stage cancer in comparison with metastatic stage cancer 
      (OR=5.18, 95% CI=1.49-17.95, p=0.007). The combination of UGT2B15 and CYP17 
      genotypes could identify higher risk subjects even in subjects with low-risk 
      UGT2B15 genotypes, i.e., Y/Y+D/Y genotypes (OR=1.97, 95% CI=0.92-4.22, p=0.079). 
      CONCLUSION: Genetic polymorphisms of the genes involved in androgen metabolism 
      and signaling were significantly associated with familial prostate cancer risk. 
      Single nucleotide polymorphisms of low-penetrance genes could be targets to 
      understand genetic susceptibility to familial prostate cancer.

TI  - Identification of differentially expressed genes in prostatic epithelium in 
      relation to androgen receptor CAG repeat length.
PG  - 96-105
AB  - The CAG repeat within exon 1 of the androgen receptor (AR) has been associated 
      with the development of prostate cancer. The shorter number of glutamine residues 
      in the protein has been associated with a higher transcriptional activity of the 
      AR and increased relative risk for prostate cancer. In an attempt to identify 
      differentially expressed genes in prostate cancer in relation to AR CAG repeat 
      length variation, in this study we used total mRNA from normal and tumor tissues 
      from 2 prostate cancer patients with AR alleles containing 19 and 26 CAG repeats 
      to perform differential-display RT-PCR analysis. We were able to identify 48 
      different transcripts that showed homology to several known genes associated with 
      different biological pathways. Among the differentially expressed genes, ATRX and 
      SFRP1 were further validated by quantitative RT-PCR. The transcripts of both ATRX 
      and SFRP1 genes proved to be down-regulated in most of the prostate tumors 
      analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. Hypermethylation of the promoter region of the 
      SFRP1 gene was found in 17.5% (7/40) of the cases analyzed and was associated 
      with the loss of SFRP1 expression (p=0.014). The differentially expressed genes 
      identified in this study are implicated in several cellular pathways that, when 
      up- or down-regulated, might play a role in the tumorigenic process of the 
      prostate.

TI  - Genetic features of the X chromosome affect pubertal development and testicular 
      degeneration in adolescent boys with Klinefelter syndrome.
PG  - 92-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate how genetic features of the X chromosome influence 
      growth, pubertal development and testicular degeneration in adolescent boys with 
      Klinefelter syndrome (KS). Previous studies have suggested that genetic features 
      of the X chromosome may contribute to the wide phenotypic variation in KS. 
      DESIGN: A prospective clinical study. PATIENTS: Fourteen nonmosaic 47,XXY boys, 
      aged 10-13.9 years. MEASUREMENTS: The relationship of genetic features of the X 
      chromosome, including parental origin of X chromosomes, the CAG repeat length of 
      the androgen receptor (AR) gene, and X inactivation with progression of pubertal 
      development, growth and testicular function in KS boys. RESULTS: Paternal 
      (47,XmXpY, n = 3) as compared to maternal (47,XmXmY, n = 11) origin of the 
      supernumerary X chromosome was associated with a later onset of puberty. In 
      47,XmXpY patients, serum LH concentrations increased above 1.0 IU/l at 12.5 +/- 
      0.6 years (mean +/- SD), Tanner stage P2 occurred at 12.5 +/- 0.7 years, and 
      pubertal acceleration of growth was noted at 13.9 +/- 1.4 years and peak velocity 
      at 14.5 +/- 0.8 years. All of these occurred 1.3-1.9 years later than in 47,XmXmY 
      patients (P = 0.01-0.09). In 47,XmXmY subjects, CAG repeat length (range 17-26) 
      correlated with age at which serum LH level first exceeded 1.0 IU/l (rs = 0.63, P 
      = 0.06, n = 10) and testosterone 1.0 nmol/l (28.8 ng/dl) (rs = 0.78, P = 0.02, n 
      = 10). CONCLUSIONS: Paternal origin of the supernumerary X chromosome is 
      associated with later onset of puberty and longer CAG repeats of the AR with 
      later pubertal reactivation of the pituitary-testicular axis in KS boys. 
      Identifying genetic factors that affect the phenotype may lead to a better 
      understanding of the pathogenesis of KS.

TI  - The CAG repeat within the androgen receptor gene and its relationship to 
      cryptorchidism.
PG  - 330-4; discussion 335
AB  - PURPOSE: We examined the significance of the CAG repeat polymorphism in the 
      pathogenesis of cryptorchidism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Genomic deoxyribonucleic 
      acid (DNA) was extracted from blood samples from 42 cryptorchid boys and from 31 
      non-cryptorchid control subjects. In the cryptorchid group, 7 had bilateral 
      cryptorchidism and 6 had patent processus vaginalis in the contralateral side. To 
      determine the number of CAG repeats, the DNA was amplified by polymerase chain 
      reaction and sequenced. RESULTS: The mean CAG repeat length in the AR gene was 
      22.5 (range 16 to 28) in patients and 21.5 (range 17 to 26) in controls 
      (non-significant). Patients with bilateral cryptorchidism had a mean length of 
      24.3 (range 21 to 26) and patients with unilateral cryptorchidism and patent 
      processus vaginalis in the contra lateral side had a mean of 25.2 (range 21 to 
      28), which was statistically different from controls (p = 0.015 and p = 0.005 
      respectively). CONCLUSION: CAG repeat length of the AR gene does not seem to play 
      a major role in patients with unilateral cryptorchidism. However, in patients 
      with bilateral undescended testis, a less functional androgen receptor through a 
      longer polyglutamine chain may have a role in its pathogenesis. In the same way, 
      patients with unilateral cryptorchidism a contralateral patent processus 
      vaginalis have longer CAG repeats that might be responsible for a slower 
      testicular descent and incomplete closure of the processus vaginalis.

TI  - The A645D mutation in the hinge region of the human androgen receptor (AR) gene 
      modulates AR activity, depending on the context of the polymorphic glutamine and 
      glycine repeats.
PG  - 3515-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sufficient androgen receptor (AR) activity is crucial for normal male 
      sexual differentiation. Here we report on two unrelated 46, XY patients suffering 
      from undervirilization and genital malformations. Both patients had a short 
      polyglycine (polyG) repeat of 10 residues and a relatively long polyglutamine 
      (polyQ) repeat of 28 and 30 residues within the transactivation domain of the AR. 
      In addition, they also harbor a rare A645D substitution. OBJECTIVE: We made a set 
      of AR expression plasmid constructs with varying polyQ and polyG tract sizes in 
      context with or without the A645D substitution and analyzed their in vitro 
      transactivation capacity in transfected CHO cells. RESULTS: We found that a short 
      polyG repeat downmodulated AR activity to approximately 60-65% of the wild-type 
      receptor. This effect was aggravated by A645D in context of a long polyQ repeat 
      to less than 50% activity. In contrast, in the context of a short polyQ and a 
      short polyG repeat, the A645D mutation rescues AR activity to almost wild-type 
      levels, demonstrating a contradictory effect of this mutation, depending on the 
      size of the polymorphic repeats. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of a short polyG 
      repeat with a long polyQ repeat and an A645D substitution might contribute to the 
      development of virilization disorders and explain the observed phenotypes of our 
      patients as a form of androgen insensitivity. The whole recreation of AR sequence 
      variations including individual polymorphic repeat sizes could unravel possible 
      interference of mutations and variations on AR activity by in vitro transfection.

TI  - The androgen receptor CAG repeat modifies the impact of testosterone on insulin 
      resistance in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.
PG  - 127-30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hyperandrogenism is a central feature of the polycystic ovary syndrome 
      (PCOS) and might worsen insulin resistance (IR) often seen in PCOS. Androgens act 
      through the androgen receptor (AR). A polymorphic CAG repeat sequence within the 
      AR gene was reported to modulate its transactivation activity. Therefore, we 
      investigated a putative interaction between testosterone and the CAG repeat 
      length polymorphism with respect to IR. DESIGN: In 63 PCOS women with normal 
      glucose tolerance free testosterone, the biallelic CAG repeat length and a 
      multiplicative interaction term were investigated by multiple linear regression 
      analysis for an association with IR as indicated by the homeostasis model 
      assessment of IR (HOMA-IR). RESULTS: Free testosterone was correlated with 
      HOMA-IR. The impact of testosterone on HOMA-IR was modified by the AR CAG length 
      as indicated by an interaction term. This interaction remained significant after 
      adjustment for smoking, age and body mass index. While there was a positive 
      association of free testosterone with HOMA-IR, the interaction term was inversely 
      associated. The model, which explained 42.5% of the variation of HOMA-IR 
      predicted that in carriers of short CAG lengths, an increase in testosterone 
      increased IR. This effect attenuated with rising biallelic CAG length until it 
      turns into the opposite at a CAG length longer than 23. The results were 
      confirmed by using CIGMA as another measure of IR. CONCLUSIONS: The association 
      between testosterone and IR is modified by the CAG repeat polymorphism within the 
      AR. Therefore, the evaluation of testosterone effects on IR seems to require 
      consideration of the AR CAG repeat polymorphism in PCOS women.

TI  - Loss of endogenous androgen receptor protein accelerates motor neuron 
      degeneration and accentuates androgen insensitivity in a mouse model of X-linked 
      spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.
PG  - 2225-38
AB  - X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA; Kennedy's disease) is a 
      polyglutamine (polyQ) disease in which the affected males suffer progressive 
      motor neuron degeneration accompanied by signs of androgen insensitivity, such as 
      gynecomastia and reduced fertility. SBMA is caused by CAG repeat expansions in 
      the androgen receptor (AR) gene resulting in the production of AR protein with an 
      extended glutamine tract. SBMA is one of nine polyQ diseases in which polyQ 
      expansion is believed to impart a toxic gain-of-function effect upon the mutant 
      protein, and initiate a cascade of events that culminate in neurodegeneration. 
      However, whether loss of a disease protein's normal function concomitantly 
      contributes to the neurodegeneration remains unanswered. To address this, we 
      examined the role of normal AR function in SBMA by crossing a highly 
      representative AR YAC transgenic mouse model with 100 glutamines (AR100) and a 
      corresponding control (AR20) onto an AR null (testicular feminization; Tfm) 
      background. Absence of endogenous AR protein in AR100Tfm mice had profound 
      effects upon neuromuscular and endocrine-reproductive features of this SBMA mouse 
      model, as AR100Tfm mice displayed accelerated neurodegeneration and severe 
      androgen insensitivity in comparison to AR100 littermates. Reduction in size and 
      number of androgen-sensitive motor neurons in the spinal cord of AR100Tfm mice 
      underscored the importance of AR action for neuronal health and survival. 
      Promoter-reporter assays confirmed that AR transactivation competence diminishes 
      in a polyQ length-dependent fashion. Our studies indicate that SBMA disease 
      pathogenesis, both in the nervous system and the periphery, involves two 
      simultaneous pathways: gain-of-function misfolded protein toxicity and loss of 
      normal protein function.

TI  - Clonal analysis of palmar fibromatosis: a study whether palmar fibromatosis is a 
      real tumor.
PG  - 21
AB  - BACKGROUND: Palmar fibromatosis that arises in the palmar soft tissue is 
      characterized by infiltrative growth with a tendency toward local recurrence but 
      does not metastasize. This study investigated the clonality of this process in 
      twelve female patients, each with a single lesion, by examining the pattern of 
      X-chromosome inactivation. METHODS: Hematoxylin and eosin stained sections of 
      formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were microdissected by laser capture 
      microdissection to obtain the proliferative spindle cells. Tumor cells were 
      isolated from the sections of rectum adenocarcinoma, and used for positive 
      control. The genomic DNAs was extracted with phenol-chloroform, digested with a 
      methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease HpaII, and amplified by polymerase 
      chain reaction (PCR), using primers targeted to a highly polymorphic short tandem 
      repeat (STR) of the human androgen receptor gene (HUMARA). RESULTS: Among the 
      twelve samples, three samples failed amplification, one sample showed 
      homozygosity which was not suitable for further analysis, eight samples were 
      successfully amplified, and showed a random X chromosome inactivation pattern, 
      suggesting polyclonality of these lesions. CONCLUSION: The current findings 
      suggest that palmar fibromatosis is a reactive proliferation rather than a clonal 
      neoplasm.

TI  - Natural history of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA): a study of 223 
      Japanese patients.
PG  - 1446-55
AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an adult-onset motoneuron disease 
      caused by a CAG-repeat expansion in the androgen receptor (AR) gene and for which 
      no curative therapy exists. However, since recent research may provide 
      opportunities for medical treatment, information concerning the natural history 
      of SBMA would be beneficial in planning future clinical trials. We investigated 
      the natural course of SBMA as assessed by nine activities of daily living (ADL) 
      milestones in 223 Japanese SBMA patients (mean age at data collection = 55.2 
      years; range = 30-87 years) followed from 1 to 20 years. All the patients were 
      diagnosed by genetic analysis. Hand tremor was an early event that was noticed at 
      a median age of 33 years. Muscular weakness occurred predominantly in the lower 
      limbs, and was noticed at a median age of 44 years, followed by the requirement 
      of a handrail to ascend stairs at 49, dysarthria at 50, dysphagia at 54, use of a 
      cane at 59 and a wheelchair at 61 years. Twenty-one of the patients developed 
      pneumonia at a median age of 62 and 15 of them died at a median age of 65 years. 
      The most common cause of death in these cases was pneumonia and respiratory 
      failure. The ages at onset of each ADL milestone were strongly correlated with 
      the length of CAG repeats in the AR gene. However CAG-repeat length did not 
      correlate with the time intervals between each ADL milestone, suggesting that 
      although the onset age of each ADL milestone depends on the CAG-repeat length in 
      the AR gene, the rate of disease progression does not. The levels of serum 
      testosterone, an important triggering factor for polyglutamine-mediated 
      motoneuron degeneration, were maintained at relatively high levels even at 
      advanced ages. These results provide beneficial information for future clinical 
      therapeutic trials, although further detailed prospective studies are also 
      needed.

TI  - CAG repeat length in exon 1 of the androgen receptor gene is related to age of 
      diagnosis but not germ line BRCA1 mutation status in ovarian cancer.
PG  - 190-4
AB  - It has been postulated that androgens, through their interaction with androgen 
      receptors (AR), may play an important role in the development of ovarian cancer. 
      Exon 1 of the AR gene contains three highly polymorphic trinucleotide repeats. 
      The length of the (CAG)n repeat segment 1 is inversely correlated with the 
      transactivation function of the AR. Recent studies have shown that BRCA1 may 
      function as an AR coregulator or coactivator and play positive roles in 
      androgen-induced cell death in cancer cells as well as other androgen/AR target 
      organs. We hypothesize that the AR gene, involved in endocrine signaling, may 
      modify BRCA1-associated ovarian cancer risk. To test this hypothesis, potential 
      associations between the (CAG)n repeat length, germ line BRCA1 mutation status, 
      and age of diagnosis for ovarian cancer were investigated. One hundred and eleven 
      ovarian cancer patients (27 hereditary and 84 sporadic) were included. All the 
      cases were allelotyped for CAG repeat length and genotyped for mutations in the 
      BRCA1 gene by direct sequencing. No association between CAG repeat length and 
      BRCA1 mutation status was identified. Furthermore, there were no differences 
      between hereditary and sporadic ovarian cancer in the number of (CAG)n repeats of 
      the short allele (P= 0.336), long allele (P= 0.875), or average allele length (P= 
      0.550). However, ovarian cancer patients from both groups (hereditary and 
      sporadic) who carried any AR allele of (CAG)n < or = 22 repeats were diagnosed on 
      average 8.17 years (95% confidence interval [1.3, 15.0]) earlier than the 
      patients whose shortest AR allele (CAG)n was >22 (P= 0.020). In conclusion, it is 
      suggested that the CAG repeat length in AR exon 1 may affect the age of diagnosis 
      of ovarian cancer but does so independent of germ line BRCA1 carrier status.

TI  - Organization of the Mycoplasma synoviae WVU 1853T vlhA gene locus.
PG  - 53-7
AB  - Mycoplasma synoviae cause respiratory disease and synovitis in poultry. It has 
      two major membrane antigens of approximately 45 to 50 kDa, MSPA and MSPB. Both 
      MSPA and MSPB ar encoded by a single gene, vlhA (variable lipoprotein and 
      haemagglutinin), possibly with a post-translational cleavage generating the two 
      proteins. The vlhA gene belongs to a large multigene family, but only one vlhA 
      gene is expressed in any single cell; the other vlhA genes/fragments are 
      transcriptionally silent. In order to characterize the vlhA gene locus, DNA 
      fragments were cloned from three different M. synoviae WVU 1853(T) genomic DNA 
      libraries and their nucleotide sequences were fully or partially determined. 
      Analysis of the resultant nucleotide sequences identified a transcriptional 
      termination signal for the expressed vlhA gene, determined the genes located 
      downstream of the expressed vlhA gene and revealed that vlhA pseudogenes were 
      arranged as tandem repeats upstream of the expressed vlhA gene. In order to 
      determine whether vlhA was expressed as a monocistronic or polycistronic message, 
      RNA from two M. synoviae clones expressing truncated or full-length versions of 
      the vlhA gene product were purified and examined by northern blotting. Messages 
      corresponding to the full length of the vlhA gene (approximately 2.4 kb) were 
      detected in both clones, suggesting that truncation of the vlhA gene product was 
      probably post-transcriptional. These studies have revealed the organization of 
      the M. synoviae vlhA gene locus and established that the vlhA gene transcript is 
      monocistronic.

TI  - Influence of number of CAG repeats on local control in the RTOG 86-10 protocol.
PG  - 14-20
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The number of CAG repeats on the androgen receptor (AR) gene is 
      inversely proportional to transcriptional activity. The purpose of this study was 
      to determine if short-term androgen deprivation therapy (RT + HT) can improve 
      outcome in patients with tumors with short CAG repeats (<19). MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Prostate cancer patients were randomized to receive either radiotherapy 
      (RT) alone or (RT + HT) in the RTOG 86-10 study. CAG repeats were measured in 94 
      tumor specimens (21%; test cohort) of the 456 (parent cohort) analyzable cases. 
      AR flow cytometry measurements were done on 13 patients. The effect on local 
      failure (LF), distant metastases (DM), prostate cancer survival (PSS), and 
      overall survival (OS) was studied. RESULTS: Pretreatment characteristics and 
      assigned treatment arm were not significantly different between the parent and 
      test groups except for a significantly higher risk of death (P = 0.049) in the 
      test group. The median CAG repeat was 19. There were no significant differences 
      in stage, or Gleason score between high (19 or greater) and low CAG (<19) 
      patients within each treatment group. Number of CAG repeats alone did not 
      significantly influence LF, DM, PSS, and OS. However, when the CAG repeat outcome 
      was studied in conjunction with androgen deprivation therapy, patients with CAG 
      <19 who received H + RT had improved local control as compared with patients who 
      received RT alone (P = 0.026, 5-year rates 4.6% versus 36.4%) and improved local 
      control over patients with CAG > or =19 that received H + RT (P = 0.028). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients with short CAG repeats show a local control benefit with 
      short-term androgen deprivation therapy, but no improvement in survival.

TI  - Rapid maxillary expansion and surgically assisted rapid maxillary expansion 
      effects on nasal volume.
PG  - 66-71
AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of rapid maxillary expansion 
      (RME) and surgically assisted rapid maxillary expansion (SARME) on nasal volume 
      using acoustic rhinometric methods. Two groups of subjects were used in the 
      study. Group 1 consisted of 10 subjects (mean age 12.30 +/- 0.82 years) who were 
      treated with RME, and group 2 consisted of 10 subjects (mean age 18.70 +/- 2.54 
      years) who were treated by SARME. In both groups, all cases had a maxillary width 
      deficiency with bilateral crossbites. Nasal volume records were taken by the same 
      otorhinolaryngologist with an AR device. AR recordings were performed for each 
      patient with and without the use of a decongestant. The first record was taken 
      before expansion, and the second record was taken at the end of retention. The 
      data for both groups were evaluated using Wilcoxon signed rank test and 
      Mann-Whitney U-test. The nasal volume showed a significant increase in both the 
      RME and the SARME groups (P < .05). The measurement with the use of decongestant 
      was similar to that without use of decongestant on the both groups (P < .05), but 
      the different increments in nasal volume between the RME and the SARME groups 
      were not statistically significant. Although the mean ages between the RME and 
      the SARME groups were different, the increase in nasal volume was similar in both 
      groups.

TI  - South Indian men with reduced CAG repeat length in the androgen receptor gene 
      have an increased risk of prostate cancer.
PG  - 254-257
LID - 10.1007/s10038-005-0346-5 [doi]
AB  - The androgen receptor (AR) gene possesses polymorphic CAG tandem repeats and the 
      repeat length has been inversely related to the risk of prostate cancer (PCa). 
      The distinct ethnic variation in the CAG repeat length may be correlated to 
      differences in PCa risk in different populations. To evaluate the CAG repeat 
      length in the AR gene and the implications for PCa, we screened 87 PCa patients 
      and 120 control subjects from South India. The mean CAG repeat length in PCa 
      patients was significantly smaller than that of controls (17.0 vs 20.7; P < 
      0.001). Men with < or = 19 CAG repeats had a significantly increased risk of 
      cancer compared to those with >19 CAG repeats (age-adjusted OR = 7.01; 95% CI = 
      3.52-13.94; P < 0.001). However, no significant association was observed between 
      CAG repeats and age of onset or prostate-specific antigen levels. Although there 
      was a trend towards shorter CAG repeat length in high grades of cancer, it was 
      not significant (P = 0.085). Thus, our results suggest an association between 
      short CAG repeats in the AR gene and PCa risk in South Indian men. Further, we 
      propose that CAG repeats could be used as a prognostic marker for PCa diagnosis.

TI  - Genetic Susceptibility to Prostate Cancer: Prostate-specific Antigen and its 
      Interaction with the Androgen Receptor (United States).
PG  - 187-97
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether directly observed prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 
      promoter diploid haplotype, either alone or in conjunction with androgen receptor 
      (AR) genotype, is associated with prostate cancer risk. METHODS: We conducted a 
      case-control study nested within the US population-based Cardiovascular Health 
      Study cohort. Incident prostate cancers were identified by linkage to cancer 
      registry records for the years 1989-2000. We genotyped 193 cases and 391 controls 
      for the PSA -252 G/A and -158 G/A SNPs and the AR CAG microsatellite, and 
      developed methods to directly determine proximal PSA promoter haplotypes. Exact 
      logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios and significance levels. 
      RESULTS: No significant associations were observed between PSA diplotype and 
      prostate cancer overall. Short (< 20) AR CAG repeat lengths were associated with 
      modest increases in the risk of prostate cancer (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 0.97-2.19; p = 
      0.071) that were significant for advanced disease (OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.02-3.26; p 
      = 0.044). Men who possessed two copies of the PSA*2 (-252G/-158G) haplotype and 
      short AR CAG repeat lengths had a 4-fold (95% CI, 1.05-20.75; exact p = 0.040) 
      increased risk of prostate cancer, and a 7-fold (95% CI, 1.25-39.78; exact p = 
      0.026) increased risk of advanced disease. CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence that 
      the PSA*2*2 diplotype in combination with short AR CAG alleles increases a man's 
      risk of developing prostate cancer. These findings support an etiologic role in 
      prostate cancer of genetic interactions between polymorphisms that increase AR 
      transactivation strength and those that alter the regulatory regions of target 
      genes such as PSA that are responsive to androgen stimulation.

TI  - Decreased androgen receptor gene methylation in premature pubarche: a novel 
      pathogenetic mechanism?
PG  - 968-72
AB  - CONTEXT: Several studies found links between DNA methylation and gene expression. 
      In patients with idiopathic hirsutism, a preferential methylation of the of 
      shorter androgen receptor (AR) alleles was hypothesized to be responsible for the 
      abnormal hair growth. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess 
      whether abnormalities in the AR function in both peripheral blood leukocytes 
      (PBLs) and androgen target tissues are present in children with premature 
      pubarche (PP). DESIGN: Human DNA was extracted from PBLs and pubic hair and CAG 
      repeats length and methylation status of the AR gene were analyzed. SETTING: The 
      study was performed at a Pediatric Endocrinology referral clinic. PATIENTS: 
      Twenty-five girls with PP, 23 prepubertal children, and 10 girls with Tanner 
      stage II pubertal development were studied. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The main 
      outcome measures were CAG repeat length and AR methylation pattern in PBLs and 
      pubic hair. RESULTS: In PBLs from PP patients, AR gene methylation was 
      significantly lower (P < 0.01) than that of prepubertal children and similar to 
      that of girls with Tanner II stage pubertal development. A negative correlation 
      between AR gene methylation in PBLs and the age of normal children was detected. 
      PATIENTS with PP exhibited a hair follicle AR methylation pattern similar to that 
      of Tanner stage II girls. The mean number of CAG repeats was lower in PP patients 
      than in prepubertal and Tanner stage II girls, although it was within the normal 
      range for the general population in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The increased AR 
      gene activity observed in PP patients, as indicated by the reduced AR gene 
      methylation pattern, together with the presence of shorter CAG repeats, might 
      lead to hypersensitivity of the hair follicles to steroid hormones and therefore 
      to the premature development of pubic hair.

TI  - Association study of androgen receptor CAG repeat polymorphism and male violent 
      criminal activity.
PG  - 548-52
AB  - Androgens exert their effects primarily by stimulating androgen receptors (ARs) 
      and androgen activity has been implicated in antisocial or violent criminal 
      behaviour. Exon 1 of the AR gene contains a highly polymorphic glutamine (CAG) 
      repeat sequence. We tested the hypothesis that shorter AR CAG repeat 
      polymorphisms, which have a greater AR gene expression, are related to violent 
      criminal activity in Chinese males using a sample of 146 extremely violent 
      criminals and 108 normal controls. The results show no association between the AR 
      repeat length and violent convicts, although we found that there are more 
      violent-criminal cases than control cases with the shorter (<17) AR gene 
      trinucleotide repeat polymorphisms (7.5% vs. 1.9%; P=0.047). No correlation was 
      found between the AR CAG repeat length and the first criminal record age in the 
      violent-criminal group. The mean AR repeat length is not significantly different 
      between substance dependence cases and antisocial personality disorder diagnosis 
      in the violent criminals and normal controls. Our findings suggest that the AR 
      CAG repeat polymorphism does not play a major role in the susceptibility of male 
      violent criminal activity.

TI  - AIB1 polymorphisms predict aggressive ovarian cancer phenotype.
PG  - 2919-22
AB  - PURPOSE: The androgen receptor (AR) harbors a polymorphic CAG repeat sequence in 
      exon 1, coding for a polyglutamine tract whose length inversely correlates with 
      AR transactivation function. AIB1, an AR coactivator, expresses a similar 
      polymorphic glutamine sequence within the carboxyl-terminal coding region. We 
      hypothesized that genotypic variations in the androgen-signaling pathway promote 
      aggressive epithelial ovarian cancer biology, and sought to examine the effect of 
      AIB1 genotype on clinical outcome. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Genotype analysis of the 
      AIB1 CAG repeat region was done on 89 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. 
      Medical records were reviewed for clinicopathologic factors and survival. Data 
      were examined using the chi(2) test and Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression 
      analyses. RESULTS: We identified four AIB1 genotypes, with glutamine codon 
      lengths of 26, 28, 29, and 30. Patients with a short AIB1 genotype (with < or =28 
      CAG repeats) showed statistically shorter time to disease recurrence compared to 
      those with a long genotype (> or =29 CAG repeats; 15.0 versus 30.0 months; P = 
      0.01). Patients with short AIB1 also showed decreased overall survival (57.0 
      months) compared to those with a long genotype (median survival not yet reached; 
      P = 0.02). When controlling for established prognostic factors, multivariate 
      analysis identified the presence of a short AIB1 genotype as an independent poor 
      prognostic factor for overall survival (P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data 
      suggest that short AIB1 genotypes may promote aggressive malignant phenotypes of 
      epithelial ovarian cancer.

TI  - Mutant androgen receptor accumulation in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy 
      scrotal skin: a pathogenic marker.
PG  - 520-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a hereditary motor neuron 
      disease caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine tract in the androgen receptor 
      (AR). The nuclear accumulation of mutant AR is central to the pathogenesis of 
      SBMA. Androgen deprivation with leuprorelin inhibits mutant AR accumulation, 
      resulting in rescue of neuronal dysfunction in a mouse model of SBMA. This study 
      aimed to investigate whether mutant AR accumulation in the scrotal skin is an 
      appropriate biomarker of SBMA. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry of both scrotal skin 
      and the spinal cord was performed on five autopsied SBMA cases. Neurological 
      severity and scrotal skin findings were studied in another 13 patients. Five 
      other patients received subcutaneous injections of leuprorelin and underwent 
      scrotal skin biopsy. RESULTS: The degree of mutant AR accumulation in scrotal 
      skin epithelial cells tended to be correlated with that in the spinal motor 
      neurons in autopsy specimens, and it was well correlated with CAG repeat length 
      and inversely correlated with the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional scale. 
      Leuprorelin treatment inhibited mutant AR protein accumulation in the scrotal 
      skin of SBMA patients. INTERPRETATION: These observations suggest that scrotal 
      skin biopsy findings are a potent pathogenic marker of SBMA and can be a 
      surrogate end point in therapeutic trials.

TI  - Androgen mediation of thrombocytosis in epithelial ovarian cancer biology.
PG  - 8015-8
AB  - PURPOSE: Preoperative thrombocytosis (platelet count > 400 x 10(9)/L) at initial 
      exploration for epithelial ovarian carcinoma is associated with decreased 
      surgical cytoreducibility and poor survival. Platelets express androgen receptor 
      (AR), which contains a polymorphic CAG trinucleotide repeat sequence of which the 
      length inversely correlates with AR transactivation function. We hypothesized 
      that androgen-mediated thrombocytosis promotes aggressive ovarian cancer biology. 
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Sixty-three patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma 
      underwent genotype analysis of the CAG repeat polymorphism in AR. Medical records 
      were reviewed to assess preoperative thrombocytosis, surgical findings, and 
      survival. Data were examined using the Fisher's exact, logistic regression, and 
      Kaplan-Meier analyses. RESULTS: AR CAG repeat lengths ranged from 8 to 27, with a 
      median of 23. Fifteen of 63 patients (23.8%) showed preoperative thrombocytosis. 
      Short AR allelotype (< or = 20 CAG repeats) was associated with a higher 
      incidence of thrombocytosis (P = 0.04). The combination of short AR allelotype 
      and thrombocytosis was the only significant factor that predicted inability to 
      achieve optimal surgical cytoreduction (P = 0.02). Women with short AR allelotype 
      and thrombocytosis showed statistically decreased progression-free survival (13 
      versus 37 months, P = 0.01) and overall survival (37 versus 65 months, P = 0.02) 
      when compared with women with long AR allelotype and normal platelet counts. On 
      multivariate analyses, suboptimal cytoreduction was the only significant factor 
      predictive of disease-specific overall survival (P = 0.0002) but the combination 
      of short AR allelotype and thrombocytosis approached statistical significance (P 
      = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: Androgen modulation of thrombocytosis may promote 
      aggressive epithelial ovarian cancer biology.

TI  - Alleles with short CAG and GGN repeats in the androgen receptor gene are 
      associated with benign endometrial cancer.
PG  - 1420-5
AB  - The human androgen receptor (AR) gene possesses 2 trinucleotide repeats of CAG 
      and GGN in exon 1. The CAG repeat corresponds to a polyglutamine tract in the 
      N-terminal region of the receptor, that affects its transcriptional efficiency. 
      The GGN repeat codifies for a polyglycine tract, and affects the amount of the AR 
      protein transcribed. The endometrium contains ARs and the androgens have 
      antiproliferative properties in cultured endometrial cancer (EC) cells. Larger 
      CAG repeats of the AR gene give rise to a weaker transcriptional activity and 
      have been found to be associated with endometrial carcinogenesis. The possible 
      involvement of CAG and GGN tracts in the progression of EC is unknown. To study 
      that possibility, we have genotyped both CAG and GGN polymorphisms of the AR gene 
      in tumor tissue genomic DNA from a series of 204 consecutive patients with EC, 
      and analyzed the results with regard to the pathological features and clinical 
      outcome of patients. We classified the alleles as S (short <or= median; S-CAG 
      <or=21 repeats; S-GGN <or=22 repeats) or L (long > median). The genotype with 
      both S-CAG repeat alleles (SS-CAG) was more common in patients diagnosed at an 
      early stage (41.6% SS-CAG vs 22.6% SL- and LL-CAG together, p = 0.048) and in 
      tumors that did not invade the vascular space (43.0% SS-CAG vs 26.4% SL- and 
      LL-CAG together, p = 0.034). The genotype with SS-GGN alleles was more common in 
      well-differentiated tumors (41.2% SS-GGN vs 25.2% LS- and LL-GGN together, p = 
      0.017) and in endometrioid histological subtype tumors (35.3% SS-GGN vs 13.0% SL- 
      and LL-GGN together, p = 0.034). When the genotypes of both repeats coexisting in 
      each tumor specimen were taken into consideration, the relationship between the 
      SS-CAG genotype and early stage remained only in the presence of the SS-GGN 
      genotype (43.9% vs 0%, p = 0.01). No other associations were observed. In 
      univariate survival analysis, patients with short alleles of both repeats (SS-CAG 
      and SS-GGN genotypes simultaneously) had a lower risk of cancer-specific death (p 
      = 0.032, mean follow-up: 63 months). Our data suggests that short CAG or GGN 
      repeats of the AR gene are associated with a more benign condition of traditional 
      prognostic variables in EC.

TI  - Androgen receptor polymorphism (CAG repeats) and androgenicity.
PG  - 356-61
AB  - Objective Polymorphism of the androgen receptor (AR) has been related to various 
      pathophysiological conditions, such as osteoporosis and infertility. The 
      objectives of this study were to evaluate the frequency of distribution in a 
      normal Italian population and to assess CAG repeats (CAGr) in other conditions, 
      such as hypoandrogenism, potentially influenced by AR polymorphism. Patients and 
      measurements CAGr polymorphism was determined in a group of 91 healthy 
      normoandrogenized subjects, 29 hypoandrogenized patients (hypoplasia of prostate 
      and seminal vesicles, reduced beard or body hair, etc.) and 29 infertile patients 
      by direct sequencing. Results The mean (+/- SD) number of CAG repeats [(CAGr)n] 
      was 21.5 (+/- 1.7) in the control group, 21.4 (+/- 2.0) in the infertile patients 
      and 24.0 (+/- 2.9) in the hypoandrogenic males. The difference was statistically 
      significant between this last group and the other two (P < 0.0001), while there 
      was no difference between normal controls and infertile patients. The frequency 
      distribution showed a shift towards higher CAG length in hypoandrogenized 
      patients compared to controls and infertile patients. If we used a cut-off point 
      of 24.9 (2 SD above the mean), the percentage of patients with 25 or more CAGr 
      repeats was 38% among hypoandrogenized patients, 7% among infertile patients and 
      5% among the control group. In hypoandrogenized subjects (CAGr)n correlated 
      slightly with testis and prostate volume. The number of CAG repeats was not 
      associated with any of the hormonal parameters, including testosterone, evaluated 
      in the three groups. Conclusions Our normal population, representing subjects 
      from Central Italy, is superimposable on other European populations with regard 
      to (CAGr)n distribution. Hypoandrogenic males have a shift in the frequency 
      distribution towards longer (CAGr)n. Infertile patients are not statistically 
      different from the control group. These findings suggest that, given the same 
      amount of circulating testosterone, as in our hypoandrogenized and control group, 
      the final net androgenic phenotypical effect is due to AR polymorphism.

TI  - Rapid maxillary expansion and nasal patency in children with Down syndrome.
PG  - 138-42
AB  - Down syndrome (DS) is the most common aneuploid disorder at birth. The life 
      expectancy of persons with DS has improved over the last forty years and is now 
      at about sixty years. Phenotypic characteristics include general hypotonia, 
      maxillary hypoplasia with a small oral cavity and a somewhat larger appearing 
      tongue, frequent constricted maxillary arch, nasal obstruction and others. This 
      prospective study assesses the effects of rapid maxillary expansion (RME) on 
      nasal patency of children with DS, using acoustic rhinometry (AR). Twenty four 
      children with DS, aged 5 to 12 years, had been randomly allocated to the RME and 
      control groups. AR was performed to these individuals prior to expansion, 
      approximately one month after, post maximal expansion, and after a 5 months 
      period of retention. The data between the two groups were compared. Rapid 
      maxillary expansion produced a significant augmentation of nasal volume in 
      children who had been treated (p < 0.05) compared to the control group; these 
      results were stable through the period of retention.

TI  - Androgen receptor CAGn repeat length influences phenotype of 47,XXY (Klinefelter) 
      syndrome.
PG  - 5041-6
AB  - CONTEXT: Klinefelter syndrome (KS; 47,XXY karyotype and variants) is 
      characterized by tall stature and testicular failure, with marked variation in 
      severity of the phenotype. Previous studies have proposed that genetic factors 
      including mosaicism, parental origin of the supernumerary X-chromosome, skewed X 
      inactivation, and androgen receptor (AR) polyglutamine repeat length may 
      contribute to phenotypic variability in KS. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this 
      study was to investigate the roles of these genetic factors in the variability of 
      the KS phenotype. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study. SETTING: The study 
      was performed at a pediatric endocrinology referral clinic. PATIENTS: Thirty-five 
      KS boys and men, aged 0.1-39 yr, were studied. INTERVENTIONS: There were no 
      interventions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Auxological measurements, biological 
      indices of testicular function, and clinical assessment of muscle tone were the 
      main outcome measures. Genetic studies included karyotyping to detect mosaicism, 
      genotyping of microsatellite markers to determine parental origin of the 
      supernumerary X-chromosome, and genotyping and methylation studies to measure AR 
      polyglutamine (AR CAGn) repeat length and X inactivation ratio. RESULTS: The only 
      genetic factor that significantly influenced the KS phenotype was the AR CAGn 
      repeat length, which was inversely correlated with penile length, a biological 
      indicator of early androgen action. Mosaicism, imprinting, and skewed X 
      inactivation did not account for the variability of the KS phenotype. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Normal genetic variation in the AR coding sequence may be clinically 
      significant in the setting of early testicular failure and subnormal circulating 
      testosterone levels, as occur in KS.

TI  - CAG repeat length in an infertile male population of Irish origin.
PG  - 295-302
AB  - The androgen receptor (AR) gene, located on the X chromosome, is an important 
      regulator of human spermatogenesis. In the past decade, the link between the CAG 
      polyglutamine tract, situated on exon one of the AR gene, and reduced 
      spermatogenesis has become a controversial one. Alterations in the length of the 
      CAG polyglutamine tract have been associated with prostate cancer at a reduced 
      intrinsic length and neuromuscular diseases at a CAG repeat length of > or = 40. 
      Minimal intermediate increases have been linked with depressed spermatogenesis in 
      infertile males. Asian and Australian groups have published an association 
      between increased CAG repeat length and reduced spermatogenesis while many 
      European studies have found no such association. The aim of this study was to 
      document the association between increased CAG repeat length and reduced 
      spermatogenesis in a group of Irish infertile males and controls known to have 
      fathered at least one child. The study employed the ABI 377 DNA sequencer to size 
      the CAG repeat region of exon one of the AR gene in each group. Statistical 
      analysis revealed no actual link between the length of the CAG tract and a 
      reduction of spermatogenesis in a cohort of infertile patients (n = 66) of Irish 
      ethnic origin when compared to a fertile control group (n = 77) (p = 0.599).

TI  - Is reduced CAG repeat length in androgen receptor gene associated with risk of 
      prostate cancer in Indian population?
PG  - 55-60
AB  - Shorter CAG repeats in androgen receptor (AR) gene have been found to be 
      associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer (CaP). Ethnic variations in 
      CAG repeat length may contribute to varying risks in different populations. To 
      evaluate the prognostic significance of androgen receptor (AR) CAG repeats in 
      Indian population for CaP, genomic DNA from 113 CaP, 57 benign prostate 
      hyperplasia (BPH) patients and 133 normal healthy controls were examined by using 
      a PCR-based GeneScan analysis. The mean number of CAG repeat in CaP was 
      significantly lower as compared to the healthy controls (20.26 vs 22.98; p = 
      0.016). The odds ratio for CaP was 2.96 (p < 0.01), when individuals with short 
      CAG repeat (< or =22) were compared with those having longer repeats (>22). A 
      significant association was also observed between short CAG repeat and young age 
      at diagnosis (OR 2.18; p = 0.04). The mean CAG repeat was not significantly 
      different in BPH and healthy controls; however, BPH patients showed a tendency 
      towards short CAG repeats. Thus, our results show that CAG repeat polymorphism in 
      AR gene is significantly associated with CaP risk, suggesting that AR CAG 
      polymorphism may act as a risk modifier to CaP in Indian population.

TI  - Androgen receptor gene CAG length polymorphism in women with polycystic ovary 
      syndrome.
PG  - 1724-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the CAG repeat length of the androgen receptor 
      (AR) gene contributes to individual differences in the susceptibility to the 
      development of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). DESIGN: Retrospective 
      case-control study. SETTING: University-based clinic. PATIENT(S): One hundred six 
      nondiabetic women with PCOS and 112 nonhirsute fertile controls. INTERVENTION(S): 
      Androgen receptor gene CAG repeat length was analyzed in women with PCOS and 
      their controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Androgen receptor gene CAG repeat length 
      in both groups. RESULT(S): The mean CAGn was 21.5 repeats in both groups (NS; 
      t-test). Furthermore, when the CAGn lengths were divided into three categories 
      (CAGn < or =18, 19-24, > or =25), the distribution was similar in both groups 
      (NS; chi2 test). However, all five women carrying < or =15 CAG repeats belonged 
      to the PCOS group. In the PCOS group, CAGn did not correlate with body mass index 
      or serum testosterone concentration. CONCLUSION(S): Androgen receptor CAGn is not 
      a major determinant of PCOS. However, it may be a significant modulator of 
      androgen-related diseases in some individuals.

TI  - CAG repeat polymorphism in the androgen receptor (AR) gene of SBMA patients and a 
      control group.
PG  - 237-9
AB  - Spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an X-linked form of motor neuron disease 
      characterized by progressive atrophy of the muscles, dysphagia, dysarthria and 
      mild androgen insensitivity. SBMA is caused by CAG repeat expansion in the 
      androgen receptor gene. CAG repeat polymorphism was analysed in a Polish control 
      group (n = 150) and patients suspected of SBMA (n = 60). Normal and abnormal 
      ranges of CAG repeats were established in the control group and in 21 patients 
      whose clinical diagnosis of SBMA was molecularly confirmed. The ranges are 
      similar to those reported for other populations.

TI  - The E211 G>A androgen receptor polymorphism is associated with a decreased risk 
      of metastatic prostate cancer and androgenetic alopecia.
PG  - 993-6
AB  - The androgen receptor (AR) gene encodes a transcription factor, which mediates 
      androgen action in target tissues, including the prostate. Prostate cancer is 
      androgen dependent, implicating AR in susceptibility to this male condition. Male 
      pattern balding, androgenetic alopecia, has recently been associated with 
      prostate cancer, suggesting shared androgen pathways. The CAG and GGC repeats in 
      the AR have been studied extensively as markers of prostate cancer 
      susceptibility, with inconclusive findings, whereas the AR-E211 G>A polymorphism 
      has been associated with androgenetic alopecia. We assessed the repeat linked 
      single nucleotide polymorphism as a marker of risk association in prostate 
      cancer, including androgenetic alopecia, in an Australian population-based 
      case-control study. In 815 prostate cancer cases and 719 controls, the proportion 
      of A-allele carriers was the same in each group. Overall, there was no evidence 
      for an association between the A allele and risk of prostate cancer, however, the 
      proportion of A-allele carriers in metastatic prostate cancer (5%) was lower than 
      in less advanced disease (16%, P = 0.03). The proportion of A-allele carriers was 
      24% in nonbald men but it was lower in men with vertex alopecia alone (13%, P = 
      0.001) or in combination with frontal alopecia (7%, P < 0.0001). This inverse 
      association between the A allele and baldness was independent of prostate cancer 
      status (P for interaction = 0.2). These results suggest that the AR-E211 A 
      allele, in linkage with the functional repeat sequences, is associated with a 
      lower risk of metastatic prostate cancer and a lower risk of alopecia.

TI  - Nasal airway changes due to rapid maxillary expansion timing.
PG  - 1-6
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of rapid maxillary expansion 
      (RME) on nasal minimum cross-sectional area (MCA) using acoustic rhinometry (AR) 
      in two groups of subjects who were treated before and after the pubertal growth 
      spurt. The sample consisted of 29 patients with maxillary constriction and a 
      control sample of 15 subjects. Both samples were divided into two groups 
      according to individual skeletal maturation as assessed by the cervical vertebral 
      maturation (CVM) method. Group I T (early-treated) consisted of 16 patients 
      (eight girls and eight boys). Group I C (early-control) consisted of eight 
      patients, and both groups had not reached the pubertal peak (CVM Stage 1-3). 
      Group II T (late-treated) consisted of 13 patients (eight girls and five boys). 
      Group II C (late-control) consisted of seven patients, and both groups were at a 
      stage during or after the pubertal peak (CVM Stage 4-6). AR records were obtained 
      for each treated subject before treatment (T1), after expansion (T2), and 
      immediately after a three-month retention period (T3); only T1 and T3 records 
      were obtained for controls. The overall increase in MCA was significantly greater 
      in the early- and late-treated groups (group I T, group II T) as compared with 
      the early and late controls. (group I C, group II C) (P < .05). The results of 
      the present study suggest that even the overall (T1-T3) increase for MCA in group 
      I T is greater (0.34 mm) than the increase for MCA in group II T (0.19 mm), but 
      the difference was not significant (P > .05).

TI  - The presence of clonal cell subpopulations in peripheral blood and bone marrow of 
      patients with refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia but not in 
      patients with refractory anemia may reflect a multistep pathogenesis of 
      myelodysplasia.
PG  - 371-9
AB  - A clonal origin of hematopoiesis was studied by investigation of X-chromosome 
      inactivation patterns (XCIP) in isolated granulocyte, CD14(+) and CD3(+) 
      subpopulations obtained from bone marrow and peripheral blood of 36 female 
      patients with primary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Clonality was assessed by 
      PCR amplification of polymorphic short tandem repeats of the human androgen 
      receptor (HUMARA) gene and by investigation of silent polymorphism of iduronate 
      sulphatase (IDS) or p55 genes. On the basis of results in a control group of 20 
      healthy age related females, a ratio of at least 9:1 between the two alleles was 
      considered a significant marker of monoclonal hematopoiesis. Ten of the 11 
      patients with advanced forms of MDS (RAEB, RAEB-T, CMML) had clonal granulocytes 
      and CD14(+) cells in peripheral blood. In patients with early disease, only 2 out 
      of 11 patients (18%) with RA or RARS, according to WHO classification, had clonal 
      granulocytes and CD14(+) cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow and 2 other 
      patients with 5q-syndrome exhibited extremely oligoclonal granulocyte 
      subpopulation in bone marrow. In contrast, we found clonal granulocytes in 12 out 
      of 14 patients (86%) with refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD) 
      and 8 of them simultanously exhibited clonal CD14(+) cells. Estimated 3 years 
      survival of patients with early disease and clonal cell subpopulations was 61% as 
      compared with 88% in patients without clonal hematopoiesis. Karyotype 
      abnormalities were detected in 11 of the 25 females with early disease. Clonal 
      patterns were present in 7 out of 8 patients with abberations diagnosed by 
      routine cytogenetics, nevertheless, FISH revealed 5q deletion in 3 patients 
      without signs of clonality in XCIP assay. No correlation was found between the 
      presence of clonal subpopulations and the degree of telomere shortening in early 
      MDS. Despite some limitations, the measurement of XCIP remains a sensitive tool 
      for diagnosis of the first transforming mutation in the clonal development of MDS 
      especially when combined with FISH and when an age related group is used to 
      establish an appropriate allele ratio to exclude constitutional or acquired 
      skewing. The occurrence of clonal cell subpopulations in most of the RCMD 
      patients in contrast to RA may reflect a proposed multistep pathogenesis of MDS 
      with dysplastic changes limited to erythropoiesis in early step and with 
      subsequent development of multilineage dysplasia. The results also support the 
      usefulness of separation of RCMD from 'pure' RA; however, a more complex insight 
      combining different molecular techniques performed in a large number of patients 
      is needed for refined classification of MDS on the basis of new molecular 
      prognostic factors and for indication of more effective targeted therapy.

TI  - GGC and StuI polymorphism on the androgen receptor gene in endometrial cancer 
      patients.
PG  - 100-4
AB  - Androgens have an anti-proliferative effect on endometrial cells. Human androgen 
      receptor (AR) gene contains two polymorphic short tandem repeats of GGC and CAG, 
      and a single-nucleotide polymorphism on exon 1 that is recognized by the 
      restriction enzyme, StuI. Prior studies have shown that the lengths of the CAG 
      repeat are inversely and linearly related to AR activity and associated with 
      endometrial cancer. However, little is known about the GGC repeat and the StuI 
      polymorphism of the AR gene. Thus, we investigated whether these AR polymorphisms 
      are risk factors for endometrial cancer. To test this hypothesis, the genetic 
      distributions of these polymorphisms were investigated in blood samples from 
      endometrial cancer patients and healthy controls. The allelic and genotyping 
      profiles were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), PCR-restriction 
      fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), and direct DNA sequencing, and analyzed 
      statistically. The GGC repeat was significantly longer in endometrial cancer 
      patients as compared to normal healthy controls. In general, an increased risk of 
      endometrial cancer was found with increasing GGC repeat. The relative risk for 
      the 17 GGC repeat was greater than 4, as compared to controls. However, the StuI 
      polymorphism was not significantly different between patients and controls. The 
      findings suggest that increased numbers of GGC repeat on the AR gene may be a 
      risk factor for endometrial cancer.

TI  - Widespread nuclear and cytoplasmic accumulation of mutant androgen receptor in 
      SBMA patients.
PG  - 659-70
AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an inherited adult onset motor 
      neuron disease caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract within 
      the androgen receptor (AR), affecting only males. The characteristic pathological 
      finding is nuclear inclusions (NIs) consisting of mutant AR with an expanded 
      polyQ in residual motor neurons, and in certain visceral organs. We 
      immunohistochemically examined 11 SBMA patients at autopsy with 1C2, an antibody 
      that specifically recognizes expanded polyQ. Our study demonstrated that diffuse 
      nuclear accumulation of mutant AR was far more frequent and extensive than NIs 
      being distributed in a wide array of CNS nuclei, and in more visceral organs than 
      thus far believed. Mutant AR accumulation was also present in the cytoplasm, 
      particularly in the Golgi apparatus; nuclear or cytoplasmic predominance of 
      accumulation was tissue specific. Furthermore, the extent of diffuse nuclear 
      accumulation of mutant AR in motor and sensory neurons of the spinal cord was 
      closely related to CAG repeat length. Thus, diffuse nuclear accumulation of 
      mutant AR apparently is a cardinal pathogenetic process underlying neurological 
      manifestations, as in SBMA transgenic mice, while cytoplasmic accumulation may 
      also contribute to SBMA pathophysiology.

TI  - Increased frequency of long androgen receptor CAG repeats in male breast cancers.
PG  - 239-46
AB  - We have investigated the possible link between androgen hyposensitivity caused by 
      long androgen receptor (AR) CAG repeats, and breast carcinogenesis, in men. AR 
      gene mutations have been described in men with androgen insensitivity syndrome 
      and breast carcinoma, and some studies have shown long CAG repeats are associated 
      with increased risk of breast cancer in women. DNA was isolated from male breast 
      cancer biopsies, and the AR CAG repeat sized. Forty one male breast cancer 
      samples were studied, including one sample from a man with spinal and bulbar 
      muscular atrophy (SBMA), which is caused by an AR CAG repeat expansion. The man 
      with breast cancer and SBMA had 49 CAG repeats (normal range 6-35), but all other 
      breast cancer samples had repeats within the normal range. The frequency of CAG 
      repeats > or =24 was significantly higher in the breast cancer group (excluding 
      the SBMA subject) than in the normal population (p<0.05), and was more marked in 
      grade I and II tumors (p=0.001). There was no correlation between AR CAG repeat 
      length and age at diagnosis. In conclusion, longer AR CAG repeats are more common 
      in men with breast cancer than in the control male population. Androgen 
      hyposensitivity, caused by long AR CAG repeats, may increase the risk of breast 
      cancer in men.

TI  - Polymorphic forms of prostate specific antigen and their interaction with 
      androgen receptor trinucleotide repeats in prostate cancer.
PG  - 309-15
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent data has suggested that polymorphisms in the prostate specific 
      antigen (PSA) may increase prostate cancer (PC) risk. The PSA gene contains a G/A 
      substitution in the androgen response element (ARE) 1 region. The androgen 
      receptor (AR) gene has polymorphic regions containing variable length glutamine 
      and glycine repeats and these are believed to be associated with PC risk. The 
      effect on PC risks from PSA polymorphisms alone and synergistically with the AR 
      gene was examined in this report. METHODS: One hundred PC patients and an age 
      matched cohort of 79 benign prostate hyperplasia and 67 population controls were 
      entered in this study. DNA was extracted from blood and PSA/ARE promoter region 
      amplified by PCR. PCR products were cut with Nhe 1 restriction enzyme to 
      distinguish G/A alleles. AR/CAG and GGC repeat length was detected by automated 
      fluorescence from PCR products. RESULTS: We found a significantly higher PSA/GG 
      distribution in PC (30%) than either benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (18%) or 
      population controls (16%) (P = 0.025). Furthermore the GG distribution within 
      cases was even greater in younger men (< 65 years; 42%; P = 0.012). Additionally, 
      when PSA genotype was cross classified with CAG repeat, significantly more cases 
      than both BPH and population controls were observed to have a short (< 22) CAG/GG 
      genotype (P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the PSA/ARE GG 
      genotype confers an increased risk of PC especially among younger men. Moreover, 
      we confirm previous results that a short glutamine repeat in conjunction with GG 
      genotype significantly increases the risk of malignant disease.

TI  - Systematic evaluation of genetic variation at the androgen receptor locus and 
      risk of prostate cancer in a multiethnic cohort study.
PG  - 82-90
AB  - Repeat length of the CAG microsatellite polymorphism in exon 1 of the androgen 
      receptor (AR) gene has been associated with risk of prostate cancer in humans. 
      This association has been the focus of >20 primary epidemiological publications 
      and multiple review articles, but a consistent and reproducible association has 
      yet to be confirmed. We systematically addressed possible causes of 
      false-negative and false-positive association in >4,000 individuals from a 
      multiethnic, prospective cohort study of prostate cancer, comprehensively 
      studying genetic variation by microsatellite genotyping, direct resequencing of 
      exons in advanced cancer cases, and haplotype analysis across the 180-kb AR 
      genomic locus. These data failed to confirm that common genetic variation in the 
      AR gene locus influences risk of prostate cancer. A systematic approach that 
      assesses both coding and noncoding genetic variation in large and diverse patient 
      samples can help clarify hypotheses about association between genetic variants

TI  - Androgen receptor gene methylation and exon one CAG repeat length in ovarian 
      cancer: differences from breast cancer.
PG  - 417-26
AB  - More than one neoplastic founder clone can exist in benign epithelial tumours. 
      Although theories of clonal selection make pluriclonality appear unlikely in 
      carcinomas, published data do not exclude this possibility. This study looked for 
      evidence of multiclonal X inactivation in ovarian carcinoma using AR methylation 
      as a marker. Fifteen unifocal ovarian carcinomas and 14 multifocal carcinomas all 
      in Scottish patients were studied. One representative formalin-fixed 
      paraffin-embedded tumour block was chosen for each of the former and two for the 
      latter. From each of these 43 tumour blocks three samples each of approximately 
      10(4) carcinoma cells were obtained by microdissection (129 in all). DNA released 
      by proteinase K digestion was subjected to PCR amplification of the androgen 
      receptor gene AR exon I CAG repeat polymorphism with and without prior digestion 
      with methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes HpaII and HhaI. Complex 
      amplification patterns were consistent with mosaic X inactivation in some ovarian 
      carcinomas but acquired anomalies of AR methylation cannot be excluded. Parallel 
      analysis of other X-linked polymorphic loci would strengthen the inference of 
      clonality status from DNA methylation data in tumour X studies. Strikingly, the 
      number of CAG repeats in the 29 ovarian tumour patients (median 16, range 11 - 
      20) was substantially fewer than in 34 previously studied breast cancer patients 
      from the same scottish population (median 21, range 14 - 26; P < 0.0001), and 
      women homozygous for the AR CAG repeat were over-represented in the ovarian 
      cancer patients but not in the breast cancer series. These findings reinforce 
      recent suggestions that AR may have a role in ovarian carcinogenesis.

TI  - Linkage between cryptorchidism, hypospadias, and GGN repeat length in the 
      androgen receptor gene.
PG  - 5105-9
AB  - Although sufficient androgen receptor (AR) function is crucial for normal male 
      sexual differentiation, single-point mutations in the AR gene are infrequent in 
      the two most common male congenital malformations, hypospadias and 
      cryptorchidism. Because polymorphic CAG and GGN segments regulate AR function, we 
      investigated whether there was any association between these polymorphisms and 
      mentioned malformations. Genotyping was performed by direct sequencing of DNA 
      from patients diagnosed with hypospadias (n = 51) and cryptorchidism (n = 23) and 
      controls (n = 210). The subjects with hypospadias were divided into subgroups of 
      glanular, penile, and penoscrotal hypospadias. Median GGN lengths were 
      significantly higher (24 vs. 23) among both subjects with cryptorchidism, 
      compared with controls (P = 0.001), and those with penile hypospadias, compared 
      with either controls (P = 0.003) or glanular and penoscrotal hypospadias combined 
      (P = 0.018). The frequency of cases with GGN 24 or more vs. GGN = 23, differed 
      significantly among those with cryptorchidism (65/35%), compared with controls 
      (31/54%) (P = 0.012), and among subjects with penile hypospadias (69/31%), 
      compared with either controls (P = 0.035) or glanular or penoscrotal hypospadias 
      combined (32/55%) (P = 0.056). There were no significant differences in CAG 
      lengths between the cases and controls. Our findings indicate an association 
      between GGN length and the risk of cryptorchidism and penile hypospadias, both 
      conditions considered consequences of low androgenicity.

TI  - Evaluation of nasal airway resistance during rapid maxillary expansion using 
      acoustic rhinometry.
PG  - 397-401
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate nasal airway resistance (NAR) during 
      rapid maxillary expansion (RME) using acoustic rhinometry (AR). The sample 
      comprised 22 children (13 girls and nine boys) with maxillary constriction. The 
      mean age was 12.9 +/- 1.54 years and all patients were found to have normal nasal 
      cavities following anterior rhinoscopic examination. A modified bonded splint 
      type RME appliance was used for expansion. AR was used to measure NAR before 
      (T1), during (T2) and after (T3) expansion, and at the end of retention (T4). 
      Each AR recording was performed, for each patient, with and without the use of a 
      decongestant. Subjective evaluation of reported changes in nasal breathing were 
      also undertaken at T3. The results showed that NAR was significantly reduced with 
      the use of RME, with the main decrease observed during expansion (P < 0.05). The 
      use of a decongestant was not found to have any effect on the results. Subjective 
      evaluation showed that 59 per cent of patients considered that their nasal 
      breathing had improved following RME.

TI  - Distribution of a single nucleotide polymorphism on codon 211 of the androgen 
      receptor gene and its correlation with human renal cell cancer in Japanese 
      patients.
PG  - 468-71
AB  - The human androgen receptor (AR) gene contains a single nucleotide polymorphism 
      (SNP) on codon 211 and two polymorphic short tandem repeats of CAG and GGC in the 
      N-terminal domain that may influence transcription efficiency of AR gene. We 
      previously reported that the lengths of the CAG and GGC repeats are inversely and 
      linearly related to AR activity and associated with several cancers. However, 
      little is known about this SNP on codon 211 of the AR gene in human renal cell 
      cancer. The cause of renal cell cancer is not well understood although several 
      factors such as chemical carcinogens and hormones have been implicated. AR has 
      been identified in human and animal renal cell cancer. We hypothesize that the 
      SNP on codon 211 is associated with human renal cell cancer. To test this 
      hypothesis, the genetic distribution of the SNP on codon 211 of AR gene was 
      investigated in renal cell cancer patients (211 cases) and healthy controls (200 
      cases). The allelic and genotypic distributions were determined by PCR-RFLP and 
      direct DNA sequencing techniques. The chi2 test for these data revealed that the 
      distribution of this SNP was not different between renal cell cancer patients as 
      compared to normal healthy controls. The findings suggest that the SNP on codon 
      211 in the AR gene may not have an important role in the carcinogenesis of human 
      renal cell cancers.

TI  - Linkage between androgen receptor gene CAG trinucleotide repeat length and 
      testicular germ cell cancer histological type and clinical stage.
PG  - 2152-8
AB  - Sex hormones and/or gonadotropins may play a crucial role in the development of 
      testicular germ cell cancer (TGCC). A direct link between this malignancy and 
      endocrine factors has not been confirmed. We tested whether CAG and GGN repeats 
      of the androgen receptor gene (AR) play a role in the aetiology or pathogenesis 
      of TGCC. Eighty-three TGCC patients and 220 controls were included. Mean CAG or 
      GGN lengths did not differ between the TGCC cases and controls. The proportion of 
      males with CAG lengths above 25, indicative of reduced androgen sensitivity, was 
      significantly lower among patients with pure seminomas and in the combined group 
      of seminomas and mixed tumours compared with non-seminomas and controls. The 
      median CAG length was higher if the tumour was metastasing at diagnosis. This is 
      the first study showing an association between the AR polymorphism and 
      histological type as well as the progression rate of TGCC.

TI  - Length and somatic mosaicism of CAG and GGN repeats in the androgen receptor gene 
      and the risk of prostate cancer in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia.
PG  - 21-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: The most common malignancy in men worldwide is cancer of the prostate 
      and determinants of prostate cancer (PRCa) risk remain largely unidentified. Many 
      candidate genes may be involved in PRCa, such as those that are central to 
      cellular growth and differentiation in the prostate gland. We analysed the 
      polymorphic CAG and GGN repeats sequence in exon 1 of the AR gene to determine if 
      the number of repeats might be an indicator of PRCa risk in patients with BPH. 
      METHODS: The study evaluated 28 patients who presented with PRCa at least 6 years 
      after the diagnosis of BPH and 56 matched patients with BPH who did not progress 
      to PRCa over a comparable period. RESULTS: This study showed no evidence for 
      association between the size of AR CAG and GGN repeats and the risk of the 
      development of PRCa in patients with BPH. However, BPH patients with AR CAG 
      instability had a 12-fold increased risk in development of PRCa. CONCLUSIONS: 
      While independent confirmation is required in further studies, these results 
      provide a potential tool to assist prediction strategies for this important 
      disease.

TI  - Structural and functional consequences of glutamine tract variation in the 
      androgen receptor.
PG  - 1677-92
AB  - The androgen receptor (AR) gene contains a polymorphic trinucleotide repeat 
      region, (CAG)(n), in its N-terminal transactivation domain (NTD) that encodes a 
      polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the receptor protein. Whereas the length of the 
      CAG repeat ranges from 6 to 39 in healthy individuals, the variations in repeat 
      length both within and outside the normal range are associated with disease, 
      including impaired spermatogenesis and Kennedy's disease, and with the risk of 
      developing breast and prostate cancer. Whereas it has been proposed that the 
      inverse relationship between polyQ tract length within the normal range and AR 
      transactivation potential may be responsible for altered risk of disease, the 
      molecular mechanisms underlying polyQ length modulation of AR function have not 
      been elucidated. In this study, we provide detailed characterization of a somatic 
      AR gene mutation detected in a human prostate tumor that results in interruption 
      of the polyQ tract by two non-consecutive leucine residues (AR-polyQ2L). Compared 
      with wtAR, AR-polyQ2L exhibits disrupted inter-domain communication (N/C 
      interaction) and a lower protein level, but paradoxically has markedly increased 
      transactivation activity. Molecular modeling and the response to cofactors 
      indicate that the increased activity of AR-polyQ2L results from the presentation 
      of a more stable platform for the recruitment of accessory proteins than 
      wild-type AR. Analysis of the relationship between polyQ tract length and AR 
      function revealed a critical size (Q16-Q29) for maintenance of N/C interaction. 
      That between 91 and 99% of AR alleles in different racial-ethnic groups encode a 
      polyQ tract in the range of Q16-Q29 suggests that N/C interaction has been 
      preserved as an essential component of androgen-induced AR signaling.

TI  - The androgen receptor gene mutations database (ARDB): 2004 update.
PG  - 527-33
AB  - The current version of the androgen receptor (AR) gene mutations database is 
      described. The total number of reported mutations has risen from 374 to 605, and 
      the number of AR-interacting proteins described has increased from 23 to 70, both 
      over the past 3 years. A 3D model of the AR ligand-binding domain (AR LBD) has 
      been added to give a better understanding of gene structure-function 
      relationships. In addition, silent mutations have now been reported in both 
      androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) and prostate cancer (CaP) cases. The 
      database also now incorporates information on the exon 1 CAG repeat expansion 
      disease, spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), as well as CAG repeat length 
      variations associated with risk for female breast, uterine endometrial, 
      colorectal, and prostate cancer, as well as for male infertility. The possible 
      implications of somatic mutations, as opposed to germline mutations, in the 
      development of future locus-specific mutation databases (LSDBs) is discussed. The 
      database is available on the Internet (http://www.mcgill.ca/androgendb/).

TI  - Androgen receptor gene cytosine, adenine, and guanine trinucleotide repeats in 
      patients with endometriosis.
PG  - 237-40
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A genetic variation in the androgen receptor (AR) has been associated 
      with the risk of developing endometriosis. The AR gene is located on the X 
      chromosome and contains a highly polymorphic trinucleotide repeat (cytosine, 
      adenine, and guanine: CAG) in its first exon, whose length and methylation 
      pattern affect both AR expression and function. Thus, we sought to further 
      investigate the potential association between endometriosis and the AR-CAG 
      polymorphism. METHODS: Genomic DNA was obtained from a consecutive series of 197 
      white Italian women of reproductive age who underwent laparoscopy for benign 
      gynecologic pathologies. Molecular analysis of AR-CAG repeats was performed by 
      polymerase chain reaction amplification and Genescan evaluation. The pattern of 
      CAG repeat distribution was compared between subjects with and without 
      endometriosis. RESULTS: Endometriosis was documented in 105 women (stage I-II in 
      33 women and stage III-IV in 72 women). We found no difference in the number of 
      AR-CAG repeats between women with endometriosis and controls. The CAG repeat 
      length ranged from eight to 27 (mean +/- standard deviation, 17.4 +/- 1.9) for 
      endometriosis patients and from 11 to 27 (mean +/- standard deviation, 17.4 +/- 
      2) for controls. Moreover, no association was found between AR gene polymorphisms 
      and the various clinical manifestations of the disease. CONCLUSION: We conclude 
      that AR-CAG repeat length does not constitute an important factor for the genetic 
      predisposition to endometriosis.

TI  - Androgen receptor gene CAG and GGC repeat lengths in idiopathic male infertility.
PG  - 417-21
AB  - The androgen receptor (AR) has two polymorphic sites in exon 1, characterized by 
      different numbers of CAG and GGC repeats resulting in variable lengths of 
      polyglutamine and polyglycine stretches. Longer CAG repeats result in a reduced 
      AR transcriptional activity, whereas the role of the GGC triplets is less clear. 
      A relationship between decreased spermatogenesis and moderate expansion in the 
      CAG tract has been found in some studies, but not in others. Furthermore, the 
      joint distribution of CAG and GGC repeats in male infertility has never been 
      reported before. We analysed CAG and GGC repeat lengths in a group of 163 men 
      with idiopathic infertility compared with 115 fertile normozoospermic men. No 
      difference was found between patients and controls in the mean and median values, 
      and in distribution of CAG and GGC, when considered separately. However, the 
      analysis of the joint distribution of CAG and GGC showed that the distribution of 
      particular haplotypes is significantly different between patients and controls. 
      In particular, two CAG/GGC haplotypes seem to increase susceptibility to 
      infertility (CAG = 21/GGC = 18 and CAG >/=21/GGC >/=18, relative risk 2.47 and 
      1.6), while one haplotype (CAG >/=23/GGC </=16, relative risk 0.09) seems to 
      confer a protective effect against the disease. These data show a combined effect 
      of CAG and GGC repeat numbers on AR function and the first evidence of a 
      relationship of particular CAG/GGC haplotypes with male infertility.

TI  - Androgen receptor YAC transgenic mice recapitulate SBMA motor neuronopathy and 
      implicate VEGF164 in the motor neuron degeneration.
PG  - 687-99
AB  - X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an inherited neuromuscular 
      disorder characterized by lower motor neuron degeneration. SBMA is caused by 
      polyglutamine repeat expansions in the androgen receptor (AR). To determine the 
      basis of AR polyglutamine neurotoxicity, we introduced human AR yeast artificial 
      chromosomes carrying either 20 or 100 CAGs into mouse embryonic stem cells. The 
      AR100 transgenic mice developed a late-onset, gradually progressive neuromuscular 
      phenotype accompanied by motor neuron degeneration, indicating striking 
      recapitulation of the human disease. We then tested the hypothesis that 
      polyglutamine-expanded AR interferes with CREB binding protein (CBP)-mediated 
      transcription of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and observed altered 
      CBP-AR binding and VEGF reduction in AR100 mice. We found that mutant AR-induced 
      death of motor neuron-like cells could be rescued by VEGF. Our results suggest 
      that SBMA motor neuronopathy involves altered expression of VEGF, consistent with 
      a role for VEGF as a neurotrophic/survival factor in motor neuron disease.

TI  - The androgen receptor gene CAG polymorphism is associated with the severity of 
      coronary artery disease in men.
PG  - 749-55
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The role of androgens in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease 
      (CAD) remains controversial. The length of the polyglutamine stretch of the 
      transactivation domain (CAG repeat) of the androgen receptor (AR) inversely 
      affects androgen activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of 
      this polymorphism of the AR gene in the extent of CAD in male patients. DESIGN 
      AND PATIENTS: The relationship of the length of the AR gene CAG repeat on the 
      severity of CAD was examined in 131 men (36-86 years old) undergoing coronary 
      angiography. MEASUREMENTS: The severity of CAD was assessed by the number (0-3) 
      of coronary vessels with > 50% reduction in the luminal diameter. The interaction 
      of the AR gene polymorphism with the intima media thickness (IMT) of peripheral 
      arteries and serum levels of sex steroids, insulin and biochemical parameters 
      were also studied. RESULTS: The upper quartile of CAG length (range 9-30) was > 
      or = 23 repeats (longAR). The mean body mass index (BMI) of patients with shorter 
      repeats (< 23; shortAR) was significantly lower than in men with longAR (26.1 vs. 
      27.6, respectively; P = 0.043 M-W Rank test). There was no correlation between 
      the AR gene repeat length and serum testosterone. Oestradiol levels were 
      significantly higher in longAR (0.19 +/- 0.08 nmol/l vs. 0.14 +/- 0.07 in 
      shortAR, P = 0.031). This difference was independent of BMI. Men with shortAR had 
      significant CAD (i.e. one to three arteries with stenosis) more frequently 
      (79.5%) than men with longAR (20.5%); of the subjects with stenosis in no 
      arteries, 56.5% had shortAR and 43.5% longAR (chi2 = 4.3, P = 0.038). This 
      association was independent of age and BMI. The IMT of peripheral arteries, lipid 
      parameters, basal insulin resistance, blood pressure and family history for early 
      CAD, did not differ according to AR length. CONCLUSIONS: The shorter CAG repeat 
      of the AR gene is associated with more severe CAD, which suggests a role for the 
      sensitivity to androgens in the increased frequency of CAD in males. In addition, 
      a protective role of endogenous oestrogen, which is higher in the longAR 
      subgroup, can contribute to the observed difference.

TI  - Polymorphism in the androgen receptor and mammographic density in women taking 
      and not taking estrogen and progestin therapy.
PG  - 1237-41
AB  - There is some evidence that women with a higher number of CAG repeat lengths on 
      the androgen receptor (AR) gene have increased breast cancer risk. We evaluated 
      the association between AR-CAG repeat length and mammographic density, a strong 
      breast cancer risk factor, in 404 African-American and Caucasian breast cancer 
      patients. In postmenopausal estrogen progestin therapy users, carriers of the 
      less active AR-CAG had statistically significantly higher mean percentage of 
      density (41.4%) than carriers of the more active AR-CAG (25.7%; P = 0.04). Our 
      results raise the question of whether the number of AR-CAG repeats predicts 
      breast cancer risk in estrogen progestin therapy users.

TI  - Androgen receptor CAG repeat lengths in ductal carcinoma in situ of breast, 
      longest in apocrine variety.
PG  - 23-7
AB  - CAG repeat number in the androgen receptor (AR) has been associated with 
      decreased prostate cancer risk, and AR expression has been found in female breast 
      cancer, often associated with apocrine differentiation. Because trinucleotide 
      expansion can alter gene expression and protein function, we hypothesized that it 
      might occur in breast neoplasms. We used a repeat expansion detection technique 
      to determine CAG repeat lengths in DNA from breast biopsies. Three lesion types 
      were microdissected: fibroadenoma (48 cases), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS, 24 
      cases), and invasive mammary carcinoma (18 cases). The maximum number of CAG 
      repeats in either allele of each patient in these three groups was compared. 
      Microsatellite repeat lengths in DCIS were longer than in fibroadenomas or 
      invasive carcinomas (P= 0.017 comparing DCIS vs invasive carcinomas). Two cases 
      of apocrine DCIS had very long repeat lengths, both exhibiting microsatellite 
      lengths at the longest range of normal (32 and 33). Inherited differences in AR 
      CAG length might influence the transition from DCIS to invasive breast cancer, 
      perhaps by modulating function of AR in breast tissue. AR microsatellite 
      polymorphisms could influence cellular differentiation in DCIS lesions, promoting 
      formation of the apocrine subtype in the presence of longer CAG repeats.

TI  - The effect of polyglutamine expansion in the human androgen receptor on its 
      ability to suppress beta-catenin-Tcf/Lef dependent transcription.
PG  - 54-8
AB  - Expansion of the polyglutamine repeat region of the androgen receptor (AR) 
      results in Kennedy's disease, a neurological disorder typified by degeneration of 
      motor neurons in the brain stem and spinal cord. As the AR has been shown to 
      inhibit beta-catenin dependent (Wnt) signalling we asked if expansion of the 
      polyglutamine repeats might affect this property of the protein. Using the 
      TOPflash/FOPflash reporter assay we found that a pathogenic form of the AR 
      containing 51 glutamine repeats showed a consistent, though minimal, reduction in 
      its ability to inhibit beta-catenin-mediated transcription, in comparison to a 
      non-pathogenic form with 20 repeats. A reduced ability to inhibit Wnt signalling 
      may thus contribute in part to the underlying aetiology of Kennedy's disease.

TI  - The CAG repeat polymorphism in the androgen receptor gene (AR) and its 
      relationship to head and neck cancer.
PG  - 177-82
AB  - Sex hormones may play an important role in the tumorigenic process of the head 
      and neck. The aim of our work was to investigate whether the androgen receptor 
      (AR) CAG repeat polymorphism is associated with an increased relative risk for 
      head and neck cancer. Genomic DNA from 103 male patients with head and neck 
      carcinomas and 100 male controls were analyzed for the AR CAG polymorphism by PCR 
      amplification and direct sequencing or denaturing polyacrilamide gel 
      electrophoresis. Logistic regression analysis showed a significant association 
      between CAG repeat length and risk of head and neck cancer in individuals with 
      more than 20 CAG repeats [OR=2.54 (95% CI, 1.3-4.8)]. For the group of 
      individuals with oral and laryngeal cancer the estimated relative risk was 
      increased to 2.79 (95% CI, 1.2-6.3) and 3.06 (95% CI, 1.0-9.6), respectively, in 
      men with CAG repeat length >20. These results suggest, for the first time, that 
      shorter AR CAG repeat alleles have a protective effect for head and neck cancer 
      development.

TI  - Androgen receptor gene polymorphism and prostate cancer in Taiwan.
PG  - 680-6
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The length of polymorphic CAG trinucleotide repeats in 
      the polyglutamine region of the androgen receptor (AR) gene has been suggested to 
      be inversely correlated with the transactivation function of the AR. An increase 
      in androgen activity may be associated with prostate cancer, and ethnic 
      variations in CAG repeat length may contribute to varying prostate cancer risks 
      in different populations. This case-control study investigated the potential role 
      of AR polymorphism in prostate cancer risk in Taiwanese. METHODS: Sixty six 
      pathologically-confirmed prostate cancer patients and 104 controls were studied. 
      CAG repeat polymorphism was genotyped by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based 
      direct sequencing method. Logistic regression was used to determine the relative 
      risk of AR gene CAG number on prostate cancer risk. The associations of AR-CAG 
      polymorphism with disease stage, pathologic grade, and age at diagnosis were 
      assessed. AR-CAG repeat number was first treated as a continuous variable, then 
      was divided into short and long groups (n < 23 vs n > or = 23) for categorical 
      analysis. The extreme groups of AR-CAG distribution were also analyzed for these 
      associations (n < or = 20 vs n > or = 26 and n = 21-25 vs n > or = 26). RESULTS: 
      The mean number of CAG repeats in patients and controls was similar: 23.2 +/- 3.0 
      (range, 15 to 31) and 22.9 +/- 3.1 (range, 15 to 31), respectively. No 
      association was found between AR-CAG repeat polymorphism and disease stage (p = 
      0.30), histological grade (p = 0.49), or age at diagnosis (p = 0.51). After 
      adjusting for other covariates (age, body mass index, education level, smoking, 
      and alcohol status), the number of AR-CAG repeats was not significantly 
      associated with prostate cancer risk [odds ratio (OR) = 0.97, 95% confidence 
      interval (95% CI) = 0.72 to 1.31; p = 0.84]. In categorical analysis, men with 
      short CAG repeats (n < 23) did not have increased risk for prostate cancer (OR = 
      0.45, 95% CI = 0.29 to 1.05) compared to those with long CAG repeats (n > or = 
      23). Non-significant differences in prostate cancer risk were also found when 
      comparing the extreme short group (n < or = 20) and the intermediate group (n = 
      21-25) to the extreme long group (n > or = 26) [n < or = 20 vs n > or = 26: OR = 
      1.00, 95% CI = 0.34 to 3.00; n = 21-25 vs n > or = 26: OR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.37 
      to 1.81]. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study do not support an important 
      effect of AR-CAG repeat polymorphism on prostate cancer risk. A large-scale study 
      is needed to clarify genetic components of prostate cancer risk in the Taiwanese 
      population.

TI  - Corticotroph carcinoma presenting as a silent corticotroph adenoma.
PG  - 41-7
AB  - Malignant pituitary tumours are rare and their pathogenesis is not fully 
      understood. We have performed genetic analyses on tissues arising from a 
      pituitary carcinoma that initially presented as a silent corticotroph adenoma but 
      which failed to respond to repeated, aggressive surgical and medical therapy. 
      Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of known or putative tumour suppressor genes (TSG) 
      was assessed by microsatellite analysis of microdissected tumour and matched 
      patient blood DNA. Clonality of the pituitary tumour samples was analysed by two 
      PCR-based techniques; one employing the highly polymorphic short tandem repeat 
      (STR) within the human androgen receptor allele (HUMARA), another based on a 
      restriction fragment length polymorphism of the X chromosome phosphoglycerokinase 
      (PGK-1) gene. Screening with 9 microsatellite markers demonstrated allelic loss 
      at 3 sites (D1S190, D3S1283 and D10S297) in all tumour samples except the 
      presenting pituitary tumour. X chromosome inactivation analysis demonstrated 
      polyclonality in the original presenting tumour and a metastatic deposit but 
      monoclonality in tissue samples from a second and third transsphenoidal 
      resection. In these cases of tumour recurrence both LOH and X chromosome 
      inactivation suggest that monoclonality arose from preferential clonal growth 
      from the original polyclonal tumour. Polyclonality of the metastatic deposit 
      suggests that this was derived from the presenting tumour, although the LOH 
      pattern indicates that a single clone dominates. The data are consistent with 
      increasing allelic loss associated with tumour dedifferentiation and malignant 
      transformation.

TI  - Identification of a mutant allele of the androgen receptor gene in a family with 
      androgen insensitivity syndrome: detection of carriers and prenatal diagnosis.
PG  - 25-9
AB  - We report the results of a molecular study of a large family segregating the 
      complete form of the Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS) in several members 
      from three generations. We identified the mutant allele by Polymerase Chain 
      Reaction (PCR) amplification of the short tandem repeat (CAG)n, highly 
      polymorphic in the population, present in the first exon of the androgen receptor 
      (AR) gene. In this family four different alleles were detected and one of these

TI  - Androgen receptor CAG repeat polymorphism in prostate cancer from a Brazilian 
      population.
PG  - 321-6
AB  - Shorter CAG repeats in the androgen receptor (AR) gene have been associated with 
      increased prostate cancer risk. Aiming to investigate whether the AR CAG 
      polymorphism is associated with an increased relative risk for prostate cancer in 
      our population, genomic DNA from 133 prostate cancer patients and 279 healthy men 
      controls were examined. We found no association between the AR CAG polymorphism 
      and the relative risk of prostate cancer in white Brazilian individuals with a 
      CAG repeat length </=21. Our results show that in the studied population the 
      Asian-descendants have the highest, the white an intermediate and the black a 
      tendency to the lowest CAG repeats rates. We observed a significant correlation 
      between a lower number of CAG repeats and young age at diagnosis (P=0.034). This 
      study is the first to investigate the association between the AR CAG repeat 
      polymorphism and the relative risk of prostate cancer in the Brazilian 
      population.

TI  - Cytogenetic and molecular analysis of the Y chromosome: absence of a significant 
      relationship between CAG repeat length in exon 1 of the androgen receptor gene 
      and infertility in Indian men.
PG  - 286-95
AB  - The genetic basis of male infertility remains unclear in the majority of cases. 
      Recent studies have indicated an association between microdeletions of the 
      azoospermia factor a (AZFa)-AZFc regions of Yq and severe oligospermia or 
      azoospermia. Increased (CAG)n repeat lengths in the androgen receptor (AR) gene 
      have also been reported in infertile men. Therefore, in order to assess the 
      prevalence of these genetic defects to male infertility, 183 men with 
      non-obstructive azoospermia (n = 70), obstructive azoospermia (n = 33), severe 
      oligospermia (n = 80) and 59 fertile men were examined cytogenetically and at 
      molecular level for Yq deletions, microdeletions, and AR-CAG repeat lengths along 
      with hormonal profiles [luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone 
      (FSH) and testosterone (T)]. We used high resolution cytogenetics to detect 
      chromosome deletions and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) involving 27 
      sequence-tagged site (STS) markers on Yq to determine the rate and extent of Yq 
      microdeletions. PCR amplification with primers flanking exon 1 of AR gene was 
      used to determine the AR-(CAG)n repeat lengths. Hormonal profiles (LH, FSH and T 
      levels) were also analysed in infertile and fertile men. Testicular biopsies 
      showed Sertoli cell only (SCO) morphology, maturation arrests (MA) and 
      hypospermatogenesis. No chromosome aberrations were found in infertile men but 
      there was a significant increase (p < 0.001) in the association of acrocentric 
      chromosomes including the Y chromosome. Yq microdeletions were found in 16 
      non-obstructive azoospermic men (16 of 70; 22%) and seven severe oligospermic 
      individuals (seven of 80; 8.7%) and most of them had deletions in the sY240 
      locus. No Yq microdeletions were detected in patients with obstructive 
      azoospermia. No statistically significant difference in the mean length of CAG 
      repeats in AR gene was observed between infertile and fertile men (22.2 +/- 1.5 
      and 21.5 +/- 1.4 respectively). No significant increase or decrease in levels of 
      LH, FSH and T was observed in infertile and fertile men. In some infertile men, 
      significantly elevated levels of FSH alone or in combination with LH were found 
      to be indicative of failure of spermatogenesis and/or suggestive of testicular 
      failure. Y-chromosome microdeletions contribute to infertility in some patients 
      but no relationship could be established with the (CAG)n repeat lengths in exon 1 
      of the AR gene in infertile Indian men.

TI  - Short androgen receptor allele length is a poor prognostic factor in epithelial 
      ovarian carcinoma.
PG  - 3667-73
AB  - PURPOSE: Epidemiological evidence implicates a heightened androgenic state in 
      women with epithelial ovarian cancer. Androgen activity may be modulated by 
      altered expression or activity of the androgen receptor (AR) or AR polymorphisms. 
      Exon 1 of the AR gene contains a polymorphic (CAG)(n) sequence whose length is 
      inversely correlated with transcriptional activity. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: 
      Differential expression of AR mRNA and protein was examined in 46 primary 
      cultures of normal human ovarian surface epithelium (HOSE) and malignant 
      Cedars-Sinai ovarian cancer (CSOC) ovarian epithelial cells. AR allele length was 
      characterized by genotyping in 77 ovarian cancer specimens. RESULTS: AR mRNA 
      expression was higher in CSOC primary cultures (1.58 +/- 0.17) when compared with 
      HOSE (1 +/- 0.09, P = 0.005), but protein expression was not statistically 
      different. CAG repeat lengths were shorter in CSOC (20.6 +/- 1.2) than in HOSE 
      (23.4 +/- 0.9, P = 0.04). Patients with an AR allele containing < or =19 CAG 
      repeats had a shorter time to recurrence (5.5 versus 19.4 months, P < 0.0001) and 
      overall survival (9 versus 32.6 months, P = 0.0007). There was no correlation 
      between AR allelotype and age of diagnosis, stage, or grade; however, a short CAG 
      length < or =19 repeats was associated with decreased surgical cytoreducibility 
      (44.4 versus 10.3%, P = 0.035). Multivariate analyses confirmed a short AR allele 
      as an independent prognostic factor (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: These data support 
      epidemiological evidence linking heightened androgenicity to the pathogenesis and 
      tumor biology of epithelial ovarian cancer.

TI  - Identification of a mutant allele of the androgen receptor gene in a family with 
      androgen insensitivity syndrome: detection of carriers and prenatal diagnosis.
PG  - 266-9
AB  - We report the results of a molecular study of a large family segregating the 
      complete form of the Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS) in several family 
      members from three generations. We identified the mutant allele by polymerase 
      chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the short tandem repeat (CAG)n, highly 
      polymorphic in the population, present in the first exon of the androgen receptor 
      (AR) gene. In this family four different alleles were detected and one of these 
      showed a perfect segregation with the disease. This study enabled us to identify 
      the heterozygous females in this family. We think that this simple, indirect 
      test, is also suitable for prenatal diagnosis of Morris' syndrome when the mother 
      is heterozygous for the size of the short tandem repeat and one affected subject 
      in the family may be studied.

TI  - Androgen receptor mutations in androgen-independent prostate cancer: Cancer and 
      Leukemia Group B Study 9663.
PG  - 2673-8
AB  - PURPOSE: The mechanisms responsible for prostate cancer androgen independence are 
      diverse. Mutations of the androgen receptor (AR) gene that broaden ligand 
      specificity have been implicated. Bone marrow specimens containing prostate tumor 
      were obtained from men undergoing antiandrogen withdrawal for AR sequence 
      analysis and clinical correlation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eligible men enrolled 
      on a trial of antiandrogen withdrawal had a minimum prostate-specific antigen 
      (PSA) level of 5 ng/dL that was increasing on castration therapy including an 
      antiandrogen. With informed consent, marrow biopsies were obtained to collect 
      prostate tumor. Additional samples were obtained from men enrolled on 
      chemotherapy trials. AR cDNA or DNA was polymerase chain reaction-amplified, 
      cloned, and sequenced. The AR CAG repeat length was recorded. RESULTS: One 
      hundred eighty-four bone marrow biopsies were obtained, and 48 had prostate tumor 
      detected by light microscopy. The ARs from these 48 samples were sequenced. 
      Overall, five (10%) of 48 tumors had mutated ARs. AR point mutations were 
      detected in the hormone-binding domain involved in transcription factor binding. 
      Three mutations were novel in prostate cancer. One tumor sample had a CAG repeat 
      length of 21, compared with germline length of 22 repeats. There was no 
      association between detectability of AR mutations and antiandrogen withdrawal 
      response or survival. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that AR mutations are 
      present in approximately 10% of patients with prostate cancer who experience 
      treatment failure with hormone therapy that included an antiandrogen. Mutations 
      in the AR likely confer a growth advantage for a subset of progressive prostate 
      cancers. Correlation of AR mutation with antiandrogen withdrawal response or 
      survival could not be made.

TI  - The CAG repeats in exon 1 of the androgen receptor gene are significantly longer 
      in endometrial cancer patients.
PG  - 1105-8
AB  - Human androgen receptor (AR) gene contains polymorphic CAG repeats in the 
      N-terminal domain that influence transcription efficiency. The CAG repeats encode 
      a poly-glutamine tract, which has a length that is inversely and linearly related 
      to AR activity. It has been observed that longer CAG repeats impose a lower 
      transactivation activity on AR and have a decreased binding affinity for 
      androgens. Androgens have an anti-proliferative effect on endometrial cells. We 
      hypothesize that the length of CAG repeats on the AR gene can predict higher 
      incidence of endometrial cancer. To test this hypothesis, the genetic 
      distributions of CAG repeats on AR gene polymorphisms were investigated in 
      endometrial cancer patients and healthy controls. Genotyping and a chi(2) test 
      revealed that the distribution of CAG repeats was significantly different between 
      the endometrial cancer patients and normal healthy controls (P<0.001). The 
      endometrial cancer patients had longer alleles than normal healthy controls. The 
      longer CAG repeats in the AR gene may cause a decrease of transactivation 
      function in the receptor, weaken an anti-proliferative effect on uterine 
      endometrial cells, and promote carcinogenesis of the uterine endometrial cells. 
      The findings suggest that the CAG repeats in the AR gene may be important in the 
      carcinogenesis of uterine endometrial cells.

TI  - The polymorphic androgen receptor gene CAG repeat, pituitary-testicular function 
      and andropausal symptoms in ageing men.
PG  - 187-94
AB  - The activity of androgen receptor (AR) is modulated by a polymorphic CAG 
      trinucleotide repeat in the AR gene. In the present study, we investigated 
      hormonal changes among ageing men, and whether the number of AR CAG triplets is 
      related to the appearance of these changes, as well as symptoms and diseases 
      associated with ageing. A total of 213 41-70-year-old men donated blood for 
      hormone analyses (LH, testosterone, oestradiol and SHBG) and answered questions 
      concerning diseases and symptoms associated with ageing and/or androgen 
      deficiency. Of these men, 172 donated blood for the measurement of the CAG repeat 
      length of AR. The CAG repeat region of the AR gene was amplified by polymerase 
      chain reaction (PCR) and the products were sized on polyacrylamide gels. The 
      repeat number was analysed as a dichotomized variable divided according to 
      cut-off limits of the lowest (< or =20 repeats) and the highest quartile (> or 
      =23 repeats), and as a continuous variable. The proportion of men with serum LH 
      in the uppermost quartile (>6.0 IU/L) with normal serum testosterone (>9.8 
      nmol/L, above the lowest 10%) increased significantly with age (p = 0.01). There 
      were fewer men with this hormonal condition among those with CAG repeat number in 
      the uppermost quartile (> or =23 repeats) (p = 0.03). These men also reported 
      less decreased potency (p < 0.05). The repeat number was positively correlated 
      with depression, as expressed by the wish to be dead (r = 0.45; p < 0.0001), 
      depressed mood (r = 0.23; p = 0.003), anxiety (r = 0.15; p < 0.05), deterioration 
      of general well-being (r = 0.22; p = 0.004), as well as decreased beard growth (r 
      = 0.49; p < 0.0001). A hormonal condition where serum testosterone is normal but 
      LH increased is a frequent finding in male ageing. Only certain types of 
      age-related changes in ageing men were associated with the length of the AR gene 
      CAG repeat, suggesting that this parameter may play a role in setting different 
      thresholds for the array of androgen actions in the male.

TI  - Hsp105alpha suppresses the aggregation of truncated androgen receptor with 
      expanded CAG repeats and cell toxicity.
PG  - 25143-50
AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused 
      by the expansion of a polyglutamine tract in the androgen receptor (AR). The 
      N-terminal fragment of AR containing the expanded polyglutamine tract aggregates 
      in cytoplasm and/or in nucleus and induces cell death. Some chaperones such as 
      Hsp40 and Hsp70 have been identified as important regulators of polyglutamine 
      aggregation and/or cell death in neuronal cells. Recently, Hsp105alpha, expressed 
      at especially high levels in mammalian brain, has been shown to suppress 
      apoptosis in neuronal cells and prevent the aggregation of protein caused by heat 
      shock in vitro. However, its role in polyglutamine-mediated cell death and 
      toxicity has not been studied. In the present study, we examined the effects of 
      Hsp105alpha on the aggregation and cell toxicity caused by expansion of the 
      polyglutamine tract using a cellular model of SBMA. The transient expression of 
      truncated ARs (tARs) containing an expanded polyglutamine tract caused aggregates 
      to form in COS-7 and SK-N-SH cells and concomitantly apoptosis in the cells with 
      the nuclear aggregates. When Hsp105alpha was overexpressed with tAR97 in the 
      cells, Hsp105alpha was colocalized to aggregates of tAR97, and the aggregation 
      and cell toxicity caused by expansion of the polyglutamine tract were markedly 
      reduced. Both beta-sheet and alpha-helix domains, but not the ATPase domain, of 
      Hsp105alpha were necessary to suppress the formation of aggregates in vivo and in 
      vitro. Furthermore, Hsp105alpha was found to localize in nuclear inclusions 
      formed by ARs containing an expanded polyglutamine tract in tissues of patients 
      and transgenic mice with SBMA. These findings suggest that overexpression of 
      Hsp105alpha suppresses cell death caused by expansion of the polyglutamine tract 
      without chaperone activity, and the enhanced expression of the essential domains 
      of Hsp105alpha in brain may provide an effective therapeutic approach for CAG 
      repeat diseases.

TI  - Analysis of G/A polymorphism in the androgen response element I of the PSA gene 
      and its interactions with the androgen receptor polymorphisms.
PG  - 864-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the in vitro functional activity of the prostate-specific 
      antigen (PSA) androgen response element (ARE) I alleles alone or in combination 
      with androgen receptor (AR) polymorphisms and to determine the association of ARE 
      I alleles with serum PSA in men without clinical prostatic disease. Data are 
      conflicting regarding the association of PSA promoter alleles with serum PSA in 
      men. METHODS: In vitro functional analyses of ARE I and AR polymorphisms were 
      conducted by luciferase reporter assays in LNCaP and PC-3 cells. Associations 
      among serum PSA, ARE I, and AR genotypes were determined by genotyping 109 white 
      and 71 African-American men determined to be free of clinical prostatic disease. 
      RESULTS: We found no significant difference in the androgen responsiveness of the 
      two alleles when cells were transfected with PSA promoter reporter constructs 
      differing only in the ARE I single nucleotide polymorphism and treated with 
      varying doses of androgen. The response to androgens of the ARE I alleles 
      co-transfected with AR expression vectors of 9, 21, and 29 CAG repeat lengths 
      were identical. No individual or combined effects of the ARE I genotype and the 
      AR genotype on serum PSA were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that ARE I 
      polymorphisms, alone or in combination with AR polymorphisms, have no functional 
      effect on the activity of the PSA promoter in vitro and in vivo.

TI  - An increased CAG repeat length in the androgen receptor gene in azoospermic ICSI 
      candidates.
PG  - 279-84
AB  - The androgen receptor gene has a polymorphic trinucleotide repeat that encodes a 
      polyglutamine tract in its N-terminal transactivation domain. We started this 
      study in order to find out whether a correlation existed between the length of 
      this polymorphic tract and the presence of azoospermia in candidates for 
      intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). The CAG repeat length in exon 1 of the 
      androgen receptor (AR) gene was directly sequenced in 102 patients with 
      azoospermia and in 96 fertile controls. Hormone levels were also measured in 
      patients with azoospermia. The mean AR gene CAG repeat length was significantly 
      larger in azoospermic subjects than it was in control fertile men (23.25 +/- 2.7 
      versus 22.42 +/- 2.8; P =.033). A receiver operating characteristic analysis 
      evidenced a cutoff point at 22/23 CAG repeats at which the probability of being 
      azoospermic increased 2.2 times. Subsequent logistic regression analysis of the 
      data showed that the odds for azoospermia increased with the number of CAG 
      repeats. Men with more than 26 CAG repeats have a 4.09 greater risk of being 
      azoospermic. Therefore, in our candidates for ICSI, a direct correlation exists 
      between the CAG repeat length in the exon 1 of the AR gene and the risk of being 
      azoospermic.

TI  - Difference between Swedish and Japanese men in the association between AR CAG 
      repeats and prostate cancer suggesting a susceptibility-modifying locus 
      overlapping the androgen receptor gene.
PG  - 529-33
AB  - Previous studies have shown that short CAG repeats in the androgen receptor (AR) 
      gene are associated with increased risk of prostate cancer. It is unclear if this 
      association is due to linkage disequilibrium with a susceptibility locus or 
      directly linked to the possible functional impact of the length of the CAG 
      repeats. In this study, the number of the AR CAG repeats was determined in 
      prostate cancer patients, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients, and 
      controls in both Swedish and Japanese men. Prostate cancer patients included 59 
      Swedish hereditary, 59 Swedish sporadic and 33 Japanese sporadic cases. BPH 
      patients included 38 Swedish and 33 Japanese cases. Controls included 98 Swedish 
      healthy men and 43 Japanese men without either prostate cancer or BPH. No 
      significant difference in AR CAG repeats was found in comparison between BPH 
      patients and controls. In contrast, both Swedish hereditary and sporadic prostate 
      cancer patients had shorter AR CAG repeats than Swedish controls, but Japanese 
      prostate cancer patients had longer repeats than controls. These differences 
      between the two populations in the association of prostate cancer and the AR CAG 
      repeats may suggest that the AR CAG repeats are in linkage disequilibrium with a 
      prostate cancer susceptibility locus localized in a small region flanking or 
      overlapping the AR gene at Xq12.1.

TI  - Androgen receptor gene alterations in Finnish male breast cancer.
PG  - 167-70
AB  - Mutations in the androgen receptor (AR) gene have been suggested to predispose to 
      male breast cancer (MBC). Studies on MBC patients have not been based on the 
      mutation screening of the entire coding region of the AR and the number of 
      subjects has been small. Therefore, some AR gene alterations may have remained 
      undetected. In the present study, we have comprehensively screened the entire 
      coding region of the AR gene for mutations and also studied the role of AR CAG 
      and GGC repeat lengths as risk factors for MBC in a cohort of 32 Finnish MBC 
      patients. To estimate the possible involvement of the prostate cancer 
      predisposing AR Arg726Leu germ-line mutation in MBC, this mutation was tested in 
      117 MBC patients. No germ-line mutations were found and the CAG and GGC repeat 
      lengths were similar among MBC cases as among Scandinavian population. Our data 
      indicate that the AR gene does not substantially contribute to MBC 
      predisposition.

TI  - Aldose reductase gene polymorphism is associated with progression of diabetic 
      nephropathy in Japanese patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 51-7
AB  - AIM: The objective of this study was to investigate cross-sectionally and 
      longitudinally whether polymorphism of the (A-C)n dinucleotide repeat sequence of 
      the aldose reductase (AR) gene may modulate risk for diabetic nephropathy or 
      retinopathy in Japanese patients with type 1 diabetes. METHODS: We obtained DNA 
      samples from 101 patients followed up after the onset of type 1 diabetes and 
      analysed a (A-C)n dinucleotide repeat polymorphic marker in the AR gene by 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. RESULTS: Ten alleles ranging from Z-10 
      (128 bp) to Z+8 (146 bp) in repeat number were identified. In cross-sectional 
      studies, the prevalence of the Z+2 allele was higher than that of any other 
      allele in patients with diabetic nephropathy (37.5% of patients in a 
      microalbuminuria group, and 41.7% of those in a macroalbuminuria group including 
      patients with chronic renal failure and maintenance haemodialysis treatment). 
      Prevalence of the Z+2 allele was not increased in patients with diabetic 
      retinopathy. In longitudinal Kaplan-Meier plots, the cumulative incidence of 
      nephropathy was significantly associated with homozygosity for the Z+2 allele 
      (log rank test, p = 0.031); respective prevalence of nephropathy after diabetes 
      durations of 10 and 15 years was 42.9% and 100% in Z+2 homozygotes (n = 8), 17.6% 
      and 27.4% in Z+2 heterozygotes (n = 44), and 6.1% and 17.4% in patients without 
      the Z+2 allele (n = 49). However, occurrence of retinopathy was not influenced by 
      the Z+2 allele (log rank test, p = 0.926). CONCLUSIONS: Homozygosity for the Z+2 
      allele was associated with accelerated early progression of diabetic nephropathy 
      in Japanese type 1 diabetic patients.

TI  - Absence of association of androgen receptor trinucleotide expansion and poor 
      semen quality.
PG  - 46-51
AB  - This study investigated the relationship between variation in the polymorphic CAG 
      trinucleotide repeat (TNR) region of the human androgen receptor (AR) gene and 
      semen quality in a Caucasian sample population. These men were patients attending 
      the New Zealand Centre for Reproductive Medicine in Christchurch. The AR TNR 
      region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and then DNA sequenced to 
      determine exact numbers of CAG repeats for each sample. In addition, the samples 
      were screened for microdeletions within the AZFc region of the Y-chromosome. A 
      total of 105 men with poor semen quality were compared with a group of 93 men 
      with normal semen quality. Men with poor semen quality had similar CAG repeat 
      number to men with normal semen quality (21.46 +/- 0.30 vs. 20.99 +/- 0.28, p = 
      0.126). Y-chromosome microdeletions were only detected in men with suboptimal 
      semen parameters (7.4%). However, the presence of a deletion was not related to 
      CAG repeat number. The CAG repeat number in the men with normal semen quality in 
      the present study is similar to the Australian and German samples, but lower than 
      those reported for the Swedes, Dutch and Danes. These results are contrary to the 
      hypothesis that higher CAG repeats are associated with infertility in men, but 
      strongly suggest that different populations may show different numbers of CAG 
      repeats in addition to racial variation reported in previous studies.

TI  - Androgen receptor gene polyglutamine length is associated with testicular 
      histology in infertile patients.
PG  - 224-7
AB  - PURPOSE: Androgens and a functioning androgen receptor are required for normal 
      spermatogenesis. The androgen receptor gene (AR) has a repetitive DNA sequence in 
      exon 1 that encodes a polyglutamine tract. Within the normal polymorphic range 
      this (CAG)(n) tract length is inversely related to the transcriptional activity 
      of the androgen receptor. In a prospective analysis we determined the association 
      of AR (CAG)(n) tract length with testicular histology in infertile males. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood DNA from 70 severely infertile patients without 
      obstruction who were undergoing testicular biopsy was amplified by polymerase 
      chain reaction targeting the AR (CAG)(n) tract. A total of 37, 15 and 18 men 
      presented with the Sertoli-cell-only syndrome, maturation arrest and 
      hypospermatogenesis, respectively. Blood DNA from 55 fertile men served as the 
      control. Polymerase chain reaction amplified DNA was direct sequenced using a 
      genetic analyzer. RESULTS: Median CAG repeat length was 22 (range 17 to 33) in 
      infertile patients and 21 (range 8 to 27) in controls (p = 0.009), including 22 
      (range 17 to 30) in patients with the Sertoli-cell-only syndrome, 22 (range 18 to 
      28) in those with maturation arrest and 23 (19 to 33) in those with 
      hypospermatogenesis. Statistical significance was noted for the 
      hypospermatogenesis versus control groups (p = 0.039) but not for the groups with 
      the Sertoli-cell-only syndrome or maturation arrest versus the control group (p = 
      0.054 and 0.591, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Infertile males with testicular 
      failure, particularly those with hypospermatogenesis, are more likely to have a 
      longer androgen receptor polyglutamine tract than controls. Polymorphisms of the 
      AR (CAG)(n) tract may contribute to spermatogenesis efficiency through a subtle 
      modulatory effect on androgen receptor function.

TI  - Androgen receptor CAG repeat length in Jewish Israeli women who are BRCA1/2 
      mutation carriers: association with breast/ovarian cancer phenotype.
PG  - 724-8
AB  - BRCA1/2 mutation carriers are at an increased risk for developing breast and/or 
      ovarian cancer. Yet, the genetic and environmental factors that govern the 
      phenotypic expression of mutant BRCA1/2 alleles remain elusive. The CAG repeat 
      within exon 1 of the androgen receptor (AR) gene is reportedly associated with 
      breast cancer phenotype in BRCA1 mutation carriers. Two hundred and twenty seven 
      BRCA1/2 mutation carriers were genotyped for the polymorphic AR CAG repeat, and 
      allele size was correlated with breast/ovarian cancer morbidity parameters. Of 
      227 BRCA1/2 carriers, 169 were BRCA1 mutation carriers and 58 carried a BRCA2 
      mutation, 149 had breast and/or ovarian cancer and 78 were asymptomatic mutation 
      carriers. The mean age at diagnosis in women with either or both neoplasms was 
      46.7+/-11.2 years, and that of the asymptomatic group - 45.8+/-9.4 years, a 
      statistically insignificant difference. The AR CAG repeat ranged from eight to 28 
      in all tested women, and the mean number of the repeats were not statistically 
      different between affected (18.3+/-2.4) and asymptomatic mutation carriers 
      (18.6+/-2.1). The AR CAG repeat among patients with early onset (<42 years) 
      breast cancer was significantly shorter (17.5+/-2.3) compared with asymptomatic 
      individuals (18.6+/-2.1) (P<0.01), and the shorter allele - the younger the age 
      at diagnosis. There is no conclusive evidence of association between AR CAG 
      repeat size and breast or ovarian cancer risk in Jewish BRCA1/2 mutation 
      carriers. A small effect of a short AR CAG allele size on breast cancer at early 
      age (<42 years) cannot be excluded.

TI  - Ligand promotes intranuclear inclusions in a novel cell model of spinal and 
      bulbar muscular atrophy.
PG  - 50855-9
AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA, Kennedy's disease) is one of a group of 
      progressive neurodegenerative diseases resulting from a polyglutamine repeat 
      expansion. In SBMA the polymorphic trinucleotide CAG repeat in exon 1 of the 
      androgen receptor (AR) gene is increased, resulting in expansion of a 
      polyglutamine tract. Patient autopsy material reveals neuronal intranuclear 
      inclusions (NII) in affected regions that contain only amino-terminal epitopes of 
      the AR. Cell models have previously been unable to produce intranuclear 
      inclusions containing only a portion of the AR. We report here the creation of an 
      inducible cell model of SBMA that reproduces this important characteristic of 
      disease pathology. PC12 cells expressing highly expanded AR form ubiquitinated 
      intranuclear inclusions containing amino-terminal epitopes of the AR as well as 
      heat shock proteins. Inclusions appear as distinct granular electron-dense 
      structures in the nucleus by immunoelectron microscopy. Dihydrotestosterone 
      treatment of mutant AR-expressing cells results in increased inclusion load. This 
      model mimics the formation of ubiquitinated intranuclear inclusions containing 
      the amino-terminal portion of AR observed in patient tissue and reveals a role 
      for ligand in the pathogenesis of SBMA.

TI  - Analysis of the polymorphic CAG repeat length in the androgen receptor gene in 
      patients with testicular germ cell cancer.
PG  - 201-4
AB  - Changes in the length of a polymorphic trinucleotide (CAG) repeat in the androgen 
      receptor (AR) gene, which may lead to altered transactivation of the AR gene, 
      have been implicated to play a role in the pathogenesis of several forms of 
      endocrine cancer and certain reproductive disorders. Subjects with reproductive 
      disorders that are associated with a relative deficiency of androgen function 
      carry an increased risk for testicular cancer, therefore we have examined the 
      (CAG)n in the AR gene in DNA isolated from peripheral blood cells of 102 patients 
      diagnosed with testicular germ cell neoplasia and compared them with a control 
      group of 110 healthy men with proven fertility. All patients and control subjects 
      underwent comprehensive andrological examination that included reproductive 
      hormone profiles and the analysis of the (CAG)n in the AR gene that was done by 
      means of PCR and DNA sequencing. There was no difference in the distribution of 
      (CAG)n between the subjects and controls, no association of (CAG)n and the tumor 
      type and no association with severity of the disease. We conclude that the high 
      risk of testicular germ cell cancer in the Danish population is not associated 
      with the (CAG)n polymorphism in the AR gene.

TI  - Polymorphic CAG repeats in the androgen receptor gene, prostate-specific antigen 
      polymorphism and prostate cancer risk.
PG  - 1647-51
AB  - As the development of prostate cancer is androgen-dependent, it has been 
      hypothesized that variation in transcriptional activity by the androgen receptor 
      (AR) related to polymorphic CAG repeats in exon 1, influences prostate cancer 
      risk. The AR regulates gene transcription by binding to androgen-response 
      elements (AREs) in target genes, such as the prostate-specific antigen (PSA). In 
      the ARE-I sequence of the PSA gene an adenine to guanine polymorphism is 
      described. It has been hypothesized that the AR binds the two PSA alleles (A and 
      G) with differing affinities and may, thereby, differentially influence prostate 
      cancer risk. To examine the role of the polymorphisms in the AR and PSA genes in 
      prostate cancer susceptibility, we conducted a case-control study of Austrian 
      Caucasians with 190 newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients and 190 age-matched 
      control men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The polymorphisms were 
      determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods using DNA from 
      peripheral white blood cells. Logistic regressions were performed to calculate 
      odds ratios (OR) and confidence limits (CL) and to control for possible 
      confounders. Our data provide no evidence for an association between prostate 
      cancer and CAG repeat length. However, we found a significant influence of the 
      ARE-I PSA polymorphism on prostate cancer risk, when calculating the combination 
      of the A/G and G/G genotypes relative to subjects with the A/A genotype (OR = 
      0.63; 95% CL 0.39-0.99; P = 0.048), suggesting that the G allele has a protective 
      effect. In a case analysis according to Gleason score, the PSA G/G genotype was 
      significantly more frequent in patients with Gleason score >7 (35.1%) than in 
      patients with Gleason score <7 (21.5%), providing evidence that the PSA G/G 
      genotype is associated with more advanced disease at time of diagnosis. However, 
      the ambivalent role of the PSA during prostate carcinogenesis needs further 
      investigation.

TI  - Genotyping of Israeli infertile men with idiopathic oligozoospermia.
PG  - 203-7
AB  - Microdeletions of the long arm of the Y chromosome involving the azoospermia 
      factor (AZF) region are associated with severe oligo- or azoospermia. Abnormal 
      androgen receptor (AR) structure or function has also been implicated in male 
      infertility. To assess the contribution of these genetic defects to male 
      infertility, 61 Israeli men with severe oligo- (n = 15) or azoospermia (n = 46), 
      were screened for Y chromosome microdeletions, and the AR-(CAG)n repeat length. 
      Fifty fertile Israeli men were similarly analyzed. PCR amplification of 20-54 
      simple tag sequences (STSs) located at Yq was used to determine the rate and 
      extent of Y chromosome microdeletions. PCR with primers flanking the AR-(CAG)n 
      region and subsequent size fractionation on gradient acrylamide gels were used to 
      determine AR-(CAG)n length. Five azoospermic individuals (5/61-8.2% and 
      5/46-10.8% of azoospermic patients) displayed Y chromosome microdeletions. The 
      mean CAG repeat number in infertile men was 18.6 +/- 3.0 compared with 16.6 + 2.7 
      in fertile men (n = 50), a statistically significant difference (p = 0.003). Y 
      chromosome microdeletions contribute to male infertility in our azoospermic 
      population, and the mean length of the AR-CAG is significantly longer in our 
      infertile population than in fertile men.

TI  - Androgen receptor CAG polymorphism and prostate cancer risk.
PG  - 166-71
AB  - Recent studies have suggested that polymorphisms of the androgen receptor gene ( 
      AR) may influence the risk of prostate cancer (PC) development and progression. 
      Here, we analyzed the length of the CAG repeat of the AR gene in 1363 
      individuals, including patients with PC, benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), and 
      population controls. There was a tendency for short CAG repeats to be associated 
      with PC. The Odds Ratio (OR) for PC was 1.47 ( P=0.05) when individuals with 
      short CAG repeats (</=18) were compared with those having long repeats (>18). CAG 
      repeat length was not significantly associated with family history, disease 
      stage, grade, age at diagnosis, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level at 
      diagnosis, or prognosis of the patients. Unexpectedly, short CAG repeats were 
      significantly less common in patients with BPH compared with controls (OR=0.47, 
      P=0.03). Our results suggest that the CAG polymorphism of the AR gene is unlikely 
      to have a major role in the development or progression of PC in the Finnish 
      population. The association of CAG repeats with the risk of BPH warrants further 
      study.

TI  - A mouse model of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.
PG  - 2103-11
AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an adult-onset motor neuron disease, 
      caused by the expansion of a trinucleotide repeat (TNR) in exon 1 of the androgen 
      receptor (AR) gene. This disorder is characterized by degeneration of motor and 
      sensory neurons, proximal muscular atrophy, and endocrine abnormalities, such as 
      gynecomastia and reduced fertility. We describe the development of a transgenic 
      model of SBMA expressing a full-length human AR (hAR) cDNA carrying 65 (AR(65)) 
      or 120 CAG repeats (AR(120)), with widespread expression driven by the 
      cytomegalovirus promoter. Mice carrying the AR(120) transgene displayed 
      behavioral and motor dysfunction, while mice carrying 65 CAG repeats showed a 
      mild phenotype. Progressive muscle weakness and atrophy was observed in AR(120) 
      mice and was associated with the loss of alpha-motor neurons in the spinal cord. 
      There was no evidence of neurodegeneration in other brain structures. Motor 
      dysfunction was observed in both male and female animals, showing that in SBMA 
      the polyglutamine repeat expansion causes a dominant gain-of-function mutation in 
      the AR. The male mice displayed a progressive reduction in sperm production 
      consistent with testis defects reported in human patients. These mice represent 
      the first model to reproduce the key features of SBMA, making them a useful 
      resource for characterizing disease progression, and for testing therapeutic 
      strategies for both polyglutamine and motor neuron diseases.

TI  - Androgen receptor exon 1 CAG repeat length and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma 
      in women.
PG  - 156-63
AB  - The androgen receptor (AR) gene is localized on chromosome X, and shorter CAG 
      repeats in exon 1 of the AR gene were recently suggested to increase hepatitis B 
      virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk among men. To examine 
      whether the relationship between the AR-CAG repeats and HCC was also evident 
      among women, we conducted a case-control study in Taiwan. The number of AR-CAG 
      repeats was determined for 238 women with HCC and 354 unrelated control subjects 
      (comprising 188 first-degree and 166 nonbiological relatives) selected from 
      female relatives of patients with HCC. Women harboring 2 AR alleles with more 
      than 23 CAG repeats had an increased risk of HCC (age-adjusted odds ratio [OR], 
      1.82; 95% CI, 1.06-3.14), compared with women with only short alleles or a single 
      long allele. The association between harboring 2 AR alleles containing longer CAG 
      repeats and HCC was more striking among HBV carriers (age-adjusted OR for more 
      than 22 repeats, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.14-4.34) and particularly prominent among HBV 
      carriers under age 53 years (age-adjusted OR, 3.16; 95% CI, 1.13-8.82). When CAG 
      repeats were analyzed as a continuous variable, the increase in HCC risk 
      associated with each incremental repeat in the shorter of 2 alleles in a given 
      genotype was statistically significant among women with a first-degree relative 
      with HCC (age-adjusted OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.01-1.37). No such relationship was 
      detected among women without the family history. In conclusion, our observations 
      suggest that the AR-CAG alleles may contribute to HCC predisposition among women 
      through a mechanism different from that for men.

TI  - Increased (CTG/CAG)(n) lengths in myotonic dystrophy type 1 and Machado-Joseph 
      disease genes in idiopathic azoospermia patients.
PG  - 1578-83
AB  - BACKGROUND: An increase in CAG trinucleotide repeat length in the androgen 
      receptor (AR) gene has been linked to idiopathic azoospermia. METHODS: In order 
      to test whether other (CAG/CTG)(n) loci are also affected, the (CAG/CTG)(n) 
      frequency distribution at myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), Machado-Joseph disease 
      (MJD), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) and spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 8 (SCA8) loci, in addition to the AR gene, was investigated in 48 
      azoospermia patients and 47 controls. RESULTS: The median CAG repeat length in 
      the AR gene was significantly longer in azoospermia patients than in controls (23 
      versus 21, P < 0.001). Significant differences were also noted in the upper tails 
      of trinucleotide repeat length distributions at both DM1 and MJD loci between the 
      two populations. At the DM1 locus, alleles of more than 18 repeats were observed 
      only in azoospermia patients, and not in controls (P = 0.014). At the MJD locus, 
      the frequency of normal alleles (ANs) with 29 or more CAG repeats was also much 
      higher in azoospermia patients (29.2 versus 7.4%; P = 0.0001). However, the 
      repeat length distribution at DRPLA and SCA8 loci did not differ in the two 
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicated that, at least in a subset of 
      azoospermia patients, there was an increase in the number of trinucleotide 
      repeats in some disease loci. Thus, it is noteworthy to evaluate whether 
      offspring of these azoospermia patients, if born by assisted reproductive 
      technologies, have an increased risk of trinucleotide repeat diseases.

      trinucleotide repeats with male infertility: a study in 109 Greek infertile men.
PG  - 149-52
AB  - This study was performed to examine the contribution of genetic polymorphism of 
      oestrogen and androgen receptor (AR) genes in male infertility. We have studied 
      in total 173 Greek men, 109 infertile patients and 64 controls (group A). 
      Patients were divided in to three subgroups: group B (n=29) with idiopathic 
      moderate oligospermia, group C (n=42) with azoospermia or idiopathic severe 
      oligospermia and group D (n=38) with azoospermia or oligospermia of various known 
      aetiologies. All patients and controls were genotyped for two polymorphisms of 
      the oestrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) gene and also for the (CAG)n repeat length 
      polymorphism of the X-linked androgen receptor (AR)gene. The control group had 
      statistically significant difference from group C regarding the XbaI polymorphism 
      of ERalpha gene. Despite the fact that we did not observe any statistically 
      significant differences in the mean and range of the CAG repeat number, the 
      frequency of the higher repeats of the nucleotide repeat sequence (CAG)n of the 
      AR gene was 2-4 times higher in groups B and C compared with the control group A. 
      Our results indicate that both ERalpha and AR gene play significant role in male 
      fertility. It is possible that a synergy may exist between unfavourable genotypes 
      of these two genes in male infertility.

TI  - Polymorphic CAG repeat length within the androgen receptor gene: identification 
      of a subgroup of patients with increased risk of ovarian cancer.
PG  - 639-44
AB  - The CAG repeat (CAGn) present in the N-terminal region of the androgen receptor 
      (AR) inversely correlates with AR transactivation activity. The aim of this study 
      was to investigate whether polymorphic variation in the CAGn length is associated 
      with the risk of developing ovarian cancer. Using a case-control study design 121 
      women with histologically confirmed ovarian cancer and 100 controls (healthy 
      women) were genotyped for AR-CAG length. No marked difference in the mean length 
      of CAGn was observed between ovarian cancer patients and controls. However, when 
      considering patients with positive personal or family history of tumor (PPFHT), 
      the mean lengths of the long allele, the short allele and the average of the 2 
      alleles were longer than in the controls. Odds ratios (OR) and their 
      corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed after allowance for 
      age. We observed an increase in the risk of ovarian cancer, in terms of OR, in 
      women with CAGn >or=22 (OR=2.17, 95% CI:1.10-4.27). The increase of relative risk 
      was particularly high in women with CAGn >or=22 belonging to the PPFHT group: 
      OR=3.52 (95% CI 1.18-10.47). We also found a statistically significant trend 
      (chi2 trend=4.91; p=0.03) towards an increased risk of ovarian cancer with 
      increasing CAGn length (from <or=21 to 22-23, 24-25 and >or=26). Again, a strong 
      association between increase in CAGn and risk of ovarian cancer was observed in 
      PPFHT patients (chi2 trend=6.38; p=0.01). The results suggest that AR-CAG repeat 
      length could play a role as modifier of the ovarian cancer risk conferred by 
      highly penetrant genes rather than itself conferring a low risk.

TI  - Polymorphic GGC repeats in the androgen receptor gene are associated with 
      hereditary and sporadic prostate cancer risk.
PG  - 122-9
AB  - Androgen receptor (AR) has long been hypothesized to play an important role in 
      prostate cancer etiology. Two trinucleotide repeat polymorphisms (CAG and GGC 
      repeats in exon 1 of the AR gene) have been investigated as risk factors for 
      prostate cancer in several studies. However, the results are inconclusive, 
      probably because of the variations of study designs, characteristics of study 
      samples, and choices of analytical methods. In this study, we evaluated evidence 
      for linkage and association between the two AR repeats and prostate cancer by 
      using the following comprehensive approaches: (1) a combination of linkage and 
      association studies, (2) a test for linkage by parametric analysis and the 
      male-limited X-linked transmission/disequilibrium test (XLRC-TDT), (3) a test for 
      association by using both population-based and family-based tests, and (4) a 
      study of both hereditary and sporadic cases. A positive but weak linkage score 
      (HLOD=0.49, P=0.12) was identified in the AR region by parametric analysis; 
      however, stronger evidence for linkage in the region, especially at the GGC 
      locus, was observed in the subset of families whose proband had < or = 16 GGC 
      repeats (HLOD=0.70, P=0.07) or by using XLRC-TDT ( z'=2.65, P=0.008). 
      Significantly increased frequencies of the < or = 16 GGC repeat alleles in 159 
      independent hereditary cases (71%) and 245 sporadic cases (68%) cases compared 
      with 211 controls (59%) suggested that GGC repeats were associated with prostate 
      cancer ( P=0.02). Evidence for the association between the < or = 16 GGC repeats 
      and prostate cancer risk was stronger with XLRC-TDT ( z'=2.66, P=0.007). No 
      evidence for association between the CAG repeats and prostate cancer risk was 
      observed. The consistent results from both linkage and association studies 
      strongly implicate the GGC repeats in the AR as a prostate cancer susceptibility 
      gene. Further studies on this polymorphism in other independent data sets and 
      functional analysis of the GGC repeat length on AR activity are warranted.

TI  - Polymorphic CAG/CAA repeat length in the AIB1/SRC-3 gene and prostate cancer 
      risk: a population-based case-control study.
PG  - 337-41
AB  - In an earlier report, we showed that a shorter CAG repeat length in the androgen 
      receptor (AR) gene is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer in 
      China, the population with the lowest reported prostate cancer incidence in the 
      world. Because AR coactivators enhance transactivation of AR, in this report we 
      evaluated the relationship of a CAG/CAA repeat length polymorphism in the 
      AIB1/SRC-3 gene (amplified in breast cancer gene 1, a steroid receptor 
      coactivator and an AR coactivator) with prostate cancer risk in a 
      population-based case-control study in China. Genomic DNA from 189 prostate 
      cancer patients and 301 healthy controls was used for the PCR-based assay. The 
      AIB1/SRC-3 CAG/CAA repeat length ranged from 24 to 32, with the most common 
      repeat length being 29. Homozygous 29/29 and heterozygous 28/29 were the most 
      common genotypes, with 44 and 30% of the controls harboring these genotypes, 
      respectively. Relative to subjects homozygous for 29 CAG/CAA repeats (29/29 
      genotype), individuals with the <29/29 genotype had a nonsignificant 31% 
      increased risk [odds ratio (OR), 1.31; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.87-1.97], 
      whereas those homozygous for the <29 allele had a significant 81% excess risk 
      (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.00-3.28). The combined effect of CAG repeat lengths in the 
      AR and AIB1/SRC-3 genes was also evaluated. Relative to men with both the 29/29 
      genotype of the AIB1/SRC-3 gene and a long CAG repeat length (> or =23) in the AR 
      gene, those with both the <29/<29 AIB1/SRC-3 genotype and a short CAG repeat 
      length in the AR gene (<23) had a 2.8-fold risk (OR, 2.78; 95% CI, 1.24-6.26). 
      Together, our data indicate that the CAG/CAA repeat length in the AIB1/SRC-3 gene 
      may be associated with prostate cancer risk in Chinese men and that the 
      combination of CAG/CAA repeat lengths in both the AIB1/SRC-3 and AR genes may 
      provide a useful marker for clinically significant prostate cancer. Expanded 
      studies in other populations are needed to confirm this association and the 
      combined effect of AIB1/SRC-3 and other hormone-related genes in prostate cancer 
      etiology.

TI  - Lack of influence of the androgen receptor gene CAG-repeat polymorphism on sex 
      steroid status and bone metabolism in elderly men.
PG  - 659-66
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Population means for serum testosterone (T) levels in healthy men 
      decrease with ageing but there is considerable interindividual variability of 
      serum T in elderly men. Ultimate androgen action is mediated through the androgen 
      receptor. Subtle differences in androgen sensitivity might contribute to serum T 
      variability through the T negative feedback regulation. The androgen receptor 
      gene (AR) contains in exon 1 a polymorphic trinucleotide CAG-repeat, whose length 
      modulates androgen receptor action. The aims of the study were to assess the 
      potential contribution of the AR CAG-repeat polymorphism in the interindividual 
      variability of serum T and in the determination of bone metabolism in ambulatory 
      elderly men. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: We used cross-sectional baseline data of a 
      longitudinal study investigating the process of ageing, in particular the changes 
      in hormonal status and bone metabolism, in a cohort of 273 community-dwelling 
      healthy men, between age 71 and 86 years. MEASUREMENTS: AR CAG-repeat length was 
      determined by automated DNA sequencing of exon 1 of the AR gene. Serum T, sex 
      hormone binding globulin, LH and oestradiol were measured by specific 
      immunoassays. Bone mineral density (BMD) was determined by dual energy X-ray 
      absorptiometry. Bone turnover was assessed by measurement of serum bone-specific 
      alkaline phosphatase, serum osteocalcin, serum C-terminal type I procollagen 
      peptide, serum and urinary C-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen and urinary 
      deoxypyridinoline levels, with use of immunoassays. RESULTS: No significant 
      association was found between the AR CAG-repeat length and either total or free 
      T, LH or the androgen sensitivity index (LHxT). BMD measurements at the hip and 
      the forearm were not associated with AR CAG-repeat length and there was no 
      association of this AR polymorphism with any of the biochemical markers of bone 
      turnover. Results were not different after adjustments for age and body mass 
      index. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study do not support the view 
      that in community-dwelling, healthy elderly men the androgen receptor gene 
      CAG-repeat polymorphism has a substantial impact on interindividual variability 
      of serum testosterone levels or on the determination of bone turnover and bone 
      mineral density.

TI  - Molecular chaperones enhance the degradation of expanded polyglutamine repeat 
      androgen receptor in a cellular model of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.
PG  - 515-23
AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is one of a growing number of 
      neurodegenerative diseases caused by a polyglutamine-encoding CAG trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion, and is caused by an expansion within exon 1 of the androgen 
      receptor (AR) gene. The family of polyglutamine diseases is characterized by the 
      presence of ubiquitinated, intranuclear inclusions associated with molecular 
      chaperones and 26S proteasome components, although the role of these inclusions 
      in the pathogenesis of polyglutamine diseases remains unclear. The 
      over-expression of molecular chaperones of the Hsp70 and Hsp40 families has been 
      shown to modulate inclusion frequency and cellular toxicity. We developed a cell 
      culture system which enables the quantitative analysis of the effects of 
      molecular chaperones on the biochemical properties of an expanded repeat AR. 
      Using this approach, we demonstrate that Hsp70 and its co-chaperone Hsp40 not 
      only increase expanded repeat AR solubility, but function to enhance the 
      degradation of expanded repeat AR through the proteasome. Furthermore, our 
      studies indicate that these molecular chaperones significantly decrease the 
      half-life of an expanded repeat AR. Molecular chaperone enhancement of protein 
      degradation points to the modulation of molecular chaperones as a potential

TI  - Allelic frequencies of six polymorphic markers for risk of prostate cancer.
PG  - 205-13
AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the distribution of polymorphisms 
      for the androgen receptor (AR) (CAG, StuI, GGN), SRD5A2 (Ala49Thr, Val89Leu) and 
      CYP17 (MspA1) genes that are considered to be relevant for risk of prostate 
      cancer. We studied 200 individuals from two cities in the State of Sao Paulo, by 
      PCR, PCR-RFLP and ASOH techniques. The allelic frequencies of the autosomal 
      markers and the StuI polymorphism of the AR gene were very similar to those 
      described in most North American and European populations. In relation to the CAG 
      and GGN number of repeats, the study subjects had smaller repeat lengths (mean of 
      20.65 and 22.38, respectively) than those described in North American, European 
      and Chinese populations. In the present study, 30.5% of the individuals had less 
      than 22 CAG repeats and 45.5% had less than 23 GGN repeats. When both repeat 
      lengths are considered jointly, this Brazilian population is remarkably different 
      from the others. Further studies on prostate cancer patients need to be conducted 
      to assess the significance of these markers in the Brazilian population.

TI  - Detection of fetal cells in intrauterine lavage samples collected in the first 
      trimester of pregnancy.
PG  - 52-5
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was first to evaluate the presence of 
      fetal cells in transcervical cell (TCC) samples collected by intrauterine lavage 
      in the first trimester of pregnancy, and then to compare different methods for 
      the detection of these cells. METHODS: TCC samples were collected by intrauterine 
      lavage before termination of pregnancy (TOP) from 81 pregnant women between 7 and 
      12 weeks of gestation. Samples of placental tissue were collected from each 
      patient at TOP, whereas maternal peripheral blood samples were obtained in 57 
      cases. DNA extracted from 81 lavage and the corresponding placental samples was 
      amplified by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay using primers for SRY and 
      HUMARA genes. All 81 lavage samples were also analysed by fluorescent in situ 
      hybridisation (FISH) using direct-labelled probes for X chromosome 
      alpha-satellite (DXZ1, Xp11.1-q11.1) and Y chromosome alpha-satellite (DYZ3, 
      Yp11.1-q11.1) regions. In 57 cases, a quantitative fluorescent (QF) PCR assay, 
      involving the use of two small tandem repeat (STR) markers (D21S11, D21S14.11) 
      specific to chromosome 21 was employed to analyse DNA extracted from placental 
      tissue, lavage and maternal blood samples. RESULTS: PCR analysis revealed that 
      40/81 placental samples were from male pregnancies. Correct sexing was achieved 
      with the PCR technique in 30/40 (75%) lavage samples retrieved from pregnant 
      women with male conceptuses and in all 41 (100%) samples collected from 
      pregnancies with female fetuses. With the FISH analysis, nuclei bearing X and Y 
      signals were observed in 32/40 cases (80%) from known male pregnancies, the rate 
      of fetal cells ranging between 2% and 95%, whereas nuclei showing X and Y signals 
      were not detected in any of the 41 lavage samples from known female pregnancies. 
      Paternal peaks were present in 30/57 (52.6%) lavage samples tested by QF-PCR. 
      CONCLUSION: The results suggest that fetal cells can be found, at a significant 
      rate, in a very high proportion of intrauterine lavage samples. Therefore, this 
      sampling technique can be regarded as a promising tool towards minimally invasive 
      prenatal diagnosis. The FISH and PCR methods showed a similar efficiency in 
      detecting fetal cells.

TI  - Rescue of polyglutamine-mediated cytotoxicity by double-stranded RNA-mediated RNA 
      interference.
PG  - 175-84
AB  - RNA interference (RNAi) is a mechanism that appears to control unwanted gene 
      expression in a wide range of species. In Drosophila, RNAi is most effectively 
      induced by double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) of over approximately 80 nucleotides 
      (nt) and in mammalian cells an RNAi-like inhibition of gene expression has been 
      shown to be mediated by dsRNAs of approximately 21-23 nt. To test if RNAi can be 
      used to specifically down-regulate a human disease-related transcript we have 
      used Drosophila and human tissue culture models of the dominant genetic disorder 
      spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). A variety of different dsRNAs were assessed 
      for the ability to inhibit expression of transcripts that included a truncated 
      human androgen receptor (ar) gene containing different CAG repeat lengths (16-112 
      repeats). In Drosophila cells, dsRNAs corresponding to non-repetitive sequences 
      mediated a high degree of sequence-specific inhibition, whereas RNA duplexes 
      containing CAG repeat tracts only induced gene-specific inhibition when flanking 
      ar sequences were included; dsRNAs containing various lengths of CAG repeats plus 
      ar sequences were unable to induce allele-specific interference. In mammalian 
      cells we tested sequence-specific small dsRNAs of 22 nt; these rescued the 
      toxicity and caspase-3 activation induced by plasmids expressing a transcript 
      encoding an expanded polyglutamine tract. This study demonstrates the feasibility 
      of targeting a transcript associated with an important group of genetic diseases 
      by RNAi.

TI  - The androgen receptor CAG repeat polymorphism and X-chromosome inactivation in 
      Australian Caucasian women with infertility related to polycystic ovary syndrome.
PG  - 161-5
AB  - The human androgen receptor (AR) gene contains a polymorphic trinucleotide (CAG) 
      repeat sequence in exon 1. The number of CAG repeats may confer differential 
      receptor activity, and specific ranges of variants have been correlated with 
      androgen-sensitive disease processes. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a 
      female condition characterized by androgen excess and infertility, many features 
      of which are effected through the AR. We compared frequency distributions of CAG 
      repeat alleles and their pattern of expression via X-inactivation analysis among 
      83 fertile women and 122 infertile women with PCOS, all of Australian Caucasian 
      ethnicity. A population comparison with 831 predominantly fertile Australian 
      women was also used. PCR-based assays were used to genotype each woman and assess 
      allele inactivation patterns after digestion of DNA with methylation-sensitive 
      HpaII. Infertile women with PCOS exhibited a greater frequency of CAG alleles or 
      biallelic means greater than 22 repeats compared with both the fertile control 
      group (P < 0.05) and the general population (P < 0.01). Preferential expression 
      of longer CAG repeat alleles was also observed in PCOS and correlated with 
      increased serum T. We conclude that the AR (CAG)n gene locus and/or its 
      differential methylation patterns influence the disease process leading to PCOS.

TI  - Analysis of the distribution of CAG repeats and X-chromosome inactivation status 
      of HUMARA gene in healthy female subjects using improved fluorescence-based 
      assay.
PG  - 281-6
AB  - We investigated the polymorphic CAG-repeat distribution and the X-inactivation 
      status of the human androgen receptor (HUMARA) gene in 58 female Japanese 
      volunteers. Polymerase chain reaction amplification was performed using a 
      fluorescent-dye-labeled primer under conditions specific for GC-rich targets, and 
      fragments were analyzed. To estimate the length of these fragments, FAM-labeled 
      (blue fluorescent) products were simultaneously compared with ROM-labeled size 
      markers (red) that were created by sequencing various HUMARA fragments. The 
      number of polymorphic CAG repeats of HUMARA in 116 alleles from 58 female 
      subjects ranged from 15 to 28. Of the 58 volunteers, 51 (88.0%) were 
      heterozygous. In 96% of the heterozygous female subjects, the allelic differences 
      were no greater than 6 repeats. X-chromosome inactivation was calculated as the 
      ratio of the area of the smaller peak to the sum of the areas of the smaller and 
      larger peaks. The average ratio was 0.38 (range, 0.09-0.50). Preferential use of 
      1 allele, by more than 75% (ratio. <0.25). was observed in 5 volunteers (10.9%). 
      The clonal nature of a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia was easily 
      identified. This method is sensitive enough to discriminate a difference of 1 
      triplet repeat.

TI  - Tandem CAG repeats of the androgen receptor gene and prostate cancer risk in 
      black and white men.
PG  - 213-6
AB  - The most common malignancy in men worldwide is cancer of the prostate. Androgens 
      play a direct role in normal and malignant growth of prostate cells via the 
      androgen receptor (AR). This study analyzed the polymorphic CAG repeat sequence 
      in exon 1 of the AR gene to determine if the number of repeats might be an 
      indicator of prostate cancer risk or aggressive disease. DNA was extracted from 
      blood samples of 20 black and 20 white men with well-documented prostate cancer 
      and 40 healthy controls (20 blacks and 20 whites). PCR amplification was followed 
      by gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing. This region normally contains between 
      9 and 29 repeats. Patients and controls both had minor variations in the number 
      of repeats, which ranged from 13 to 27 with 21 being the most frequent allele. 
      Black controls and patients both had a mean of 20 +/- 3 repeats; in whites the 
      mean was significantly lower in patients than controls (21 +/- 2 versus 23 +/- 2; 
      p = 0.004). Combined black and white patients also had a lower number than the 
      combined group of controls (20 +/- 3 versus 22 +/- 3; p = 0.02). Similarly, black 
      and white patients with aggressive disease had a lower number than patients whose 
      disease was more slowly progressive (19 +/- 2 versus 22 +/- 3; p = 0.02). We 
      conclude that the small differences in the number of CAG repeats in both black 
      and white patients do not appear to be a strong indicator of risk or aggressive 
      disease but that this size polymorphism may be one of many genetic and

TI  - Micropenis and the AR Gene: mutation and CAG repeat-length analysis.
PG  - 5372-8
AB  - Various mutations of the AR gene and expanded CAG repeats at exon 1 of that gene 
      have been reported in patients with hypospadias or genital ambiguity. However, 
      the role of the AR gene has not been systemically studied in those with isolated 
      micropenis lacking hypospadias or genital ambiguity. We studied 64 Japanese boys 
      with isolated micropenis (age, 0-14 yr; median, 7 yr), whose stretched penile 
      lengths were between -2.5 and -2.0 SD (borderline micropenis) in 31 patients 
      (age, 0-13 yr; median, 8 yr) and below -2.5 SD (definite micropenis) in 33 
      patients (age, 0-14 yr; median, 6 yr). Mutation analysis of the AR gene was 
      performed for exons 1-8 and their flanking introns, except for the CAG and GGC 
      repeat regions at exon 1, by denaturing HPLC and direct sequencing, identifying a 
      substitution of cytosine to thymine at a position -3 in the 3' splice site of 
      intron 1 in a patient with definite micropenis. CAG repeat length at exon 1 was 
      determined by electrophoresis with internal size markers and direct sequencing, 
      revealing no statistically significant difference in the distribution of CAG 
      repeat lengths [median (range) and mean +/- SE: total patients with isolated 
      micropenis, 24 (14-34) and 23.5 +/- 0.38; patients with borderline micropenis, 24 
      (15-29) and 23.5 +/- 0.53; patients with definite micropenis, 23 (14-34) and 23.5 
      +/- 0.56; and 100 control males, 23 (16-32) and 23.5 +/- 0.29] or in the 
      frequency of long CAG repeats (percentage of CAG repeats > or =26 and > or =28: 
      total patients with isolated micropenis, 17.2 and 4.7%; patients with borderline 
      micropenis, 19.4 and 6.5%; patients with definite micropenis, 15.2 and 3.0%; and 
      100 control males, 21.0 and 10.0%). These results suggest that an AR gene 
      mutation is rare and that CAG repeat length is not expanded in children with 
      isolated micropenis.

TI  - The CAG repeat polymorphism in the AR gene affects high density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol and arterial vasoreactivity.
PG  - 4867-73
AB  - Genomic effects of T are exerted via the AR. The length of the polymorphic CAG 
      repeat sequence in the AR gene is inversely correlated with the transcriptional 
      regulation of target genes by T. In 110 healthy men (20-50 yr), we investigated 
      the interactions among this polymorphism, serum levels of sex hormones, 
      cardiovascular risk factors, and flow-mediated and nitrate-induced vasodilatation 
      of the brachial artery. The number of CAG repeat had no significant correlations 
      with serum concentrations of total or free T. Stepwise multiple regression 
      analysis revealed positive correlations of the number of CAG repeat with serum 
      levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (partial r = 0.44; P < 0.001) and 
      flow-mediated vasodilatation (partial r = 0.37; P < 0.001). The association of 
      CAG repeat with high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was independent of 
      body fat content and serum levels of free T, which both had significant negative 
      correlations with HDL cholesterol. The association of CAG repeat with 
      flow-mediated vasodilatation was independent of cigarette smoking and serum 
      levels of free T and low density lipoprotein cholesterol, which also were 
      correlated with flow-mediated vasodilatation. We conclude that a low number of 
      CAG repeat in the AR gene implies a greater chance for low levels of HDL 
      cholesterol and reduced endothelial response to ischemia, which are both 
      important risk factors for coronary heart disease.

TI  - The polymorphic CAG repeat in the androgen receptor gene in Jewish Israeli women 
      with endometrial carcinoma.
PG  - 1190-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endometrial carcinoma is considered a hormonal-dependent tumor; 
      estrogen induces endometrial cellular proliferation, whereas progestins display 
      an antiproliferative effect on endometrial tissue. The role that androgen and its 
      receptor (androgen receptor [AR]) play in the pathogenesis of endometrial 
      carcinoma is less clear. Although androgen has an in vitro inhibitory effect on 
      endometrial cell proliferation, up to 75% of endometrial carcinoma express AR 
      somatically. A polymorphic CAG repeat within exon 1 of the AR encodes for a 
      polyglutamine tract, with length range of 8 to 33 repeats, which is inversely 
      correlated with the transcriptional activity of the AR. METHODS: To gain insight 
      into the role of AR in endometrial carcinoma, the authors analyzed the 
      polymorphic CAG repeat in 79 Jewish Israeli patients with endometrial carcinoma 
      as compared with 44 healthy Jewish women serving as controls. Analysis was 
      conducted using germline DNA as template and using polymerase chain reaction 
      primers flanking the CAG repeat with subsequent fluorescent determination of 
      allele sizes. RESULTS: Allele size range of the longer of the two alleles in the 
      patients was 11-33 (mean, 19.8 +/- 2.7) and in the controls 10-22 (mean, 17.9 +/- 
      1.9), a statistically significant difference (P < 0.01). Allele size variation 
      within the patient group did not correlate with disease stage, grade, 
      reproductive history, or age at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The authors conclude that 
      AR-CAG repeat length differs in Jewish patients with endometrial carcinoma as 
      compared with healthy individuals in Israel, and this finding increases the 
      possibility that the AR is involved in the predisposition to this neoplasm.

TI  - Prostate carcinoma risk and allelic variants of genes involved in androgen 
      biosynthesis and metabolism pathways.
PG  - 1130-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ethnicity, when it is used to mean shared genetic inheritance within 
      a group, has become one of the most important factors in determining prostate 
      carcinoma risk. Genetic polymorphisms were hypothesized to be the probable 
      explanation for differences in risk among ethnic groups. The authors evaluated 
      the association between polymorphisms in genes involved in the androgen 
      biosynthesis and metabolism pathway and the risk of prostate carcinoma. METHODS: 
      Two hundred twenty-six patients with the pathologic diagnosis of sporadic 
      prostate tumor and 156 healthy matched (age, ethnic group) male controls from a 
      large epidemiologic cohort were genotyped for previously described polymorphisms 
      in the androgen receptor (AR), 5alpha-reductase type II (SRD5A2), p450c17 
      (CYP17), and aromatase (CYP19) genes. The different polymorphisms in prostate 
      carcinoma patients also were analyzed according to age of onset, preoperative 
      prostate-specific antigen level, tumor stage, and tumor grade. RESULTS: The 
      distribution of the tetranucleotide simple tandem repeat polymorphism (STRP) in 
      intron 4 of CYP19 was significantly different in control and cancer patients (P = 
      0.012). The 171 allele and the 187 allele were associated with prostate carcinoma 
      risk (P = 0.05 and P = 0.045, respectively). Conversely, no association was 
      observed between prostate carcinoma risk and the other polymorphisms studied as 
      follow: the CAG repeat in exon 1 of AR, the (TA)n dinucleotide repeat 
      polymorphism in the 3' untranslated region, and the A49T or V89L substitutions in 
      SDR5A2, the single base pair (bp) (a T to C transition) polymorphism that creates 
      an additional Sp1-type (CCACC box) promoter site in CYP17. In prostate carcinoma 
      patients, CAG repeats of AR, and TA repeats of SDR5A2 are associated with age of 
      onset (P = 0.05 and P < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The association 
      between the 171-bp allele of CYP19 and prostate carcinoma risk suggests that 
      aromatase could be used as a new indicator for prostate carcinoma prevention in 
      men of White French ethnogeographic origin. Conversely, it is possible that an 
      individual carries both a high- and a low-risk marker (e.g., CYP17 A2 allele and 
      V89L in SRD5A2) resulting in no overall difference in risk observed across the 
      population. For these reasons, the development of a polygenic model, 
      incorporating multiple loci from the individual genes may maximize the chance of 
      identifying individuals with high-risk genotypes.

TI  - A case-control study of the androgen receptor gene CAG repeat polymorphism in 
      Australian prostate carcinoma subjects.
PG  - 941-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The development of prostate carcinoma is androgen-dependent. The 
      coding sequence of the androgen receptor (AR) gene contains a CAG repeat 
      polymorphism that has been shown to influence AR activity in vitro. Studies of 
      this polymorphism as a prostate carcinoma risk factor have been conflicting. 
      METHODS: A matched case-control design was used in a clinic-based multicenter 
      study of Australian prostate carcinoma subjects. Cancer subjects were matched by 
      age and locality with controls, all of whom had a serum prostate specific antigen 
      (PSA) level of less than 4 mg/L. Conditional logistic regression was used to 
      determine the relative risk of prostate carcinoma dependent on AR gene CAG 
      number. The association of disease characteristics at diagnosis with the 
      polymorphism also was assessed. RESULTS: Five hundred forty-five cases of 
      prostate carcinoma and 456 matched case-control pairs were recruited. Association 
      studies of disease characteristics at diagnosis showed age at diagnosis to be 
      associated with AR CAG number by univariate (P = 0.004) and multivariate 
      (adjusting for PSA, stage, and grade) linear regression (P = 0.018). No 
      association was observed between the polymorphism and disease stage (TNM-based 
      categories; P = 0.277), histologic grade (P = 0.41), or PSA level at diagnosis (P 
      = 0.48). In the pairwise case-control analysis, the odds ratio of prostate 
      carcinoma for a change of 5 CAG repeats gave an odds ratio of 0.9821 (95% 
      confidence interval, 0.84-1.15). CONCLUSIONS: In this Australian study 
      population, the AR CAG repeat polymorphism was not a risk factor for prostate 
      carcinoma, but a shorter repeat sequence was associated with earlier age at 
      diagnosis.

TI  - Polymorphic repeats in the androgen receptor gene in high-risk sibships.
PG  - 200-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genetic susceptibility may explain some familial clusters of prostate 
      cancer. The polymorphic androgen receptor (AR) gene, which mediates androgen 
      activity in the prostate, is a candidate gene that may influence predisposition 
      to the disease. METHODS: We analyzed the polymorphic (CAG)n and (GGN)n repeats 
      within the AR gene in men from 51 high-risk prostate cancer sibships, which 
      included at least one affected and one unaffected man (n = 210). We compared 
      repeat lengths of men with prostate cancer (n = 140) to their brothers (n = 70) 
      without disease, stratified by median age at diagnosis of affected men within 
      each sibship. Conditional logistic regression was used to compute odds ratios 
      (OR) and 95% confidence intervals to evaluate associations between prostate 
      cancer and repeat length. RESULTS: The OR for prostate cancer associated with 
      short (CAG)n repeats (< 22) compared to longer repeats (> or =22) was 1.13 (95% 
      CI 0.5-2.4) overall, but was higher in sibships with a median age of <66 years at 
      diagnosis (OR = 1.72, 95% CI 0.5-6.0). The (GGN)n array also was not associated 
      with prostate cancer in general. However, in older men (> or = 66 years), there 
      was a modest elevation in risk (OR = 1.56, 95% CI 0.6-4.1) among those with short 
      repeats (GGN of < or =16). Men with both a short (CAG)n (< 22) and a short (GGN)n 
      (< or =16) array were not at higher risk (OR = 1.06) compared to men with two 
      long repeats [(CAG)n > or =22 and (GGN)n >16)]. CONCLUSIONS: These results 
      suggest that the (CAG)n and (GGN)n repeats in the AR gene do not play a major 
      role in familial prostate cancer.

TI  - Mutation screening and CAG repeat length analysis of the androgen receptor gene 
      in Klinefelter's syndrome patients with and without spermatogenesis.
PG  - 1653-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mutations of the androgen receptor (AR) gene give rise to a wide 
      array of phenotypic abnormalities. A systematic analysis of the AR gene in 
      patients with 47,XXY has not previously been performed. METHODS: Mutations of the 
      AR gene and expansion of the CAG repeats in exon 1 of the AR gene were studied in 
      13 patients with Klinefelter's syndrome either with (n = 1) or without (n = 12) 
      spermatogenesis. RESULTS: No abnormalities in the AR gene were detected by single 
      strand conformational polymorphism analysis. The CAG lengths ranged from 17 to 27 
      (mean +/- SD 22.8 +/- 3.3, median 23) for Klinefelter patients or from 17 to 28 
      (mean +/- SD 23.2 +/- 2.6, median 23) for control subjects. X-inactivation 
      analysis for the methylation status of the AR gene was performed in seven 
      patients who were heterozygous for CAG repeats of different length, showing that 
      the longer CAG repeat alleles underwent random but more frequent inactivation in 
      five patients and skewed inactivation in two. CONCLUSIONS: An AR gene abnormality 
      does not constitute an important factor for impaired spermatogenesis in patients 
      with Klinefelter's syndrome.

TI  - Evidence that longer androgen receptor polyglutamine repeats are a causal factor 
      for genital abnormalities.
PG  - 3207-10
AB  - Moderate to severe undermasculinized genitalia was recently shown to be 
      associated with longer polyglutamine repeats within the androgen receptor 
      [AR(Gln)n]. However, it was unknown whether this was because longer AR(Gln)n 
      contributed to the: 1) etiology; 2) severity; and/or 3) testicular maldescent. 
      Therefore, AR(Gln)n length in 175 males with abnormal genitalia were analyzed 
      according to etiology (known or unknown), severity (complete, severe, and 
      moderate), or testis position (abdominal, inguinal, or scrotal). Etiology (P = 
      0.01) and severity (P = 0.02) but not testis position (P = 0.52) were associated 
      with AR(Gln)n length. The association between the severity of the genital 
      abnormalities and AR(Gln)n length was due to the close association of severity 
      with the etiology (P < 0.0001). A highly selected group with moderate to severe 
      genital abnormalities and multiple criteria to exclude known etiological factors 
      had a greater AR(Gln)n length (mean, 25.33) than all other samples (mean, 23.11; 
      P = 0.0004). The results suggest that AR(Gln)n length does not influence the 
      severity of undermasculinization or testis descent but instead contributes to the 
      causation of genital abnormalities in a subset of patients. These findings, 
      together with a demonstrated relationship between severity and multifactorial 
      etiology, are incorporated into a proposed model for the involvement of AR(Gln)n 
      length in genital abnormalities.

TI  - Multiple founder effects in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA, Kennedy 
      disease) around the world.
PG  - 431-6
AB  - SBMA (spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy), also called Kennedy disease, is an 
      X-chromosomal recessive adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder caused by death of 
      the spinal and bulbar motor neurones and dorsal root ganglia. Patients may also 
      show signs of partial androgen insensitivity. SBMA is caused by a CAG repeat 
      expansion in the first exon of the androgen receptor (AR) gene on the 
      X-chromosome. Our previous study suggested that all the Nordic patients with SBMA 
      originated from an ancient Nordic founder mutation, but the new intragenic SNP 
      marker ARd12 revealed that the Danish patients derive their disease chromosome 
      from another ancestor. In search of relationships between patients from different 
      countries, we haplotyped altogether 123 SBMA families from different parts of the 
      world for two intragenic markers and 16 microsatellites spanning 25 cM around the 
      AR gene. The fact that different SBMA founder haplotypes were found in patients 
      from around the world implies that the CAG repeat expansion mutation has not been 
      a unique event. No expansion-prone haplotype could be detected. Trinucleotide 
      diseases often show correlation between the repeat length and the severity and 
      earlier onset of the disease. The longer the repeat, the more severe the symptoms 
      are and the onset of the disease is earlier. A negative correlation between the 
      CAG repeat length and the age of onset was found in the 95 SBMA patients with 
      defined ages at onset.

TI  - Lack of association between androgen receptor CAG polymorphism and familial 
      breast/ovarian cancer.
PG  - 31-6
AB  - The human androgen receptor (AR) gene contains a highly polymorphic CAG repeat in 
      exon 1 that is inversely correlated with AR transcriptional activity in vitro. 
      Several studies have shown that fewer CAG repeats are associated with an 
      increased risk as well as more aggressive forms of prostate cancer. More 
      recently, AR allele length was also inversely correlated with the histological 
      grade of breast cancer, but no association was found between the AR-CAG 
      polymorphism and the risk of either breast or ovary cancer. On the contrary, it 
      was proposed that a longer CAG repeat sequence might be associated with an 
      increased risk of breast cancer in BRCA1 mutation carriers, thus suggesting a 
      different role of the AR-CAG polymorphism in sporadic and inherited breast 
      cancers. With the intent of better understanding the role of the AR-CAG 
      polymorphism as a cancer risk modifier, we defined the AR genotype of 151 
      patients (101 with breast and 50 with ovary cancer) belonging to high-risk 
      breast/ovary cancer families. No difference in CAG repeat length was found 
      between either breast and ovary cancer patients or age at diagnosis of both 
      tumors. These results were also confirmed in a sub-group of 47 breast cancer 
      cases, that either carried a BRCA gene mutation (11 cases) or were identified by 
      very stringent operational criteria as hereditary breast cancers. Even though a 
      substantially larger sample size would be required to reach conclusive evidence, 
      our findings suggest that the AR-CAG polymorphism does not act as a modifier of 
      tumor onset or tumor phenotype in breast/ovarian cancer families.

TI  - Hypospadias and the androgen receptor gene: mutation screening and CAG repeat 
      length analysis.
PG  - 409-13
AB  - We report on mutation screening and CAG repeat length analysis of the androgen 
      receptor (AR) gene in 21 patients with hypospadias. The urethral meatus was 
      located at the glandular region in six patients (glandular type), at the penile 
      shaft in seven patients (penile type), and at the scrotal/perineal region in 
      eight patients (scrotal/perineal type). Mutation screening was performed for 
      exons 1-8 and their flanking introns (except for the CAG and GGC repeat regions 
      at exon 1) by the heteroduplex detection method and showed no abnormal 
      chromatograms. The CAG repeat length analysis was carried out using 50 normal 
      boys and 50 fertile males as controls, and demonstrated no statistically 
      significant difference in the median of CAG repeat lengths or in the frequency of 
      long CAG repeats (> or = 26 or > or = 28) between the controls and the patients 
      with the three different types of hypospadias. The results suggest that AR gene 
      abnormalities do not constitute a major factor in the development of hypospadias.

TI  - Larger trinucleotide repeat size in the androgen receptor gene of infertile men 
      with extremely severe oligozoospermia.
PG  - 444-8
AB  - Androgens are significant regulators of human spermatogenesis. Their action is 
      mediated through the androgen receptor (AR), which binds to the androgen 
      responsive element on DNA and regulates gene transcription. Men become infertile 
      with spinobulbar muscular atrophy (Kennedy disease) caused by a trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion, > or = 40 CAG repeats, in the AR gene located on the X 
      chromosome. In this prospective study, we investigated whether the variable size, 
      larger repeats, of this trinucleotide could alter AR function and result in 
      impaired spermatogenesis. A total of 69 infertile men were studied. Clinical and 
      laboratory analysis showed idiopathic, nonobstructive azoospermia in 16 men, 
      extremely severe oligozoospermia in 27 men (< 1 million sperm/mL), and severe 
      oligozoospermia in 26 men (1 to 5 million sperm/mL). Fertile control men (n = 45) 
      were selected by documented paternity proven by linkage analysis. Leukocyte DNA 
      was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification across the AR 
      repeat region. Accurate size determination of the PCR product using an ABI 373 
      DNA sequencer allowed precise calculation of CAG repeat sizes. The AR gene was 
      not analyzed for other types of mutations. The difference in CAG repeat size 
      between infertile men and proven fertile controls was statistically significant, 
      P = .03. Patients with extremely severe oligozoospermia had significantly longer 
      CAG repeat tracts (mean, 25.4 +/- 4.0; P = .0005; range 20-39) than controls 
      (mean, 22 +/- 2.8; range 12-30) or patients with severe oligozoospermia (mean, 
      22.2 +/- 2.3; range 18-26). None of the 26 infertile men with sperm counts < 1 
      million/mL had < or = 19 CAG repeats compared with 6 out of 45 controls (13%; P = 
      .06). This study suggests that some men with severe impairment of spermatogenesis 
      have longer trinucleotide repeats in the AR gene. Although direct evidence is 
      missing, lower affinity between androgen and the AR protein or decreased AR 
      protein availability with longer repeats could be responsible for a diminished 
      androgen effect on spermatogenesis. Two of the patients in the extremely severe 
      oligozoospermia group had 35 and 39 CAG repeats, respectively (normal range is 11 
      to 33). Although not yet considered a mutation, longer trinucleotide repeats are 
      unstable and might either expand or contract between generations. If they expand, 
      conception through the use of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), could 
      result in the son of an

PG  - 23-6
AB  - X-linked recessive spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an adult-onset X-linked 
      neurodegenerative disease, characterised by muscular atrophy, bulbar symptoms and 
      endocrinological disturbances. SBMA is caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat in 
      the androgen receptor gene. The maximum number of CAG repeats found in a healthy 
      person is 35 while the minimum number of repeats found in SBMA patients is 38. We 
      have identified a 46-year-old man from an SBMA family with 37 CAG repeats who 
      until now is clinically unaffected. Interestingly, his 85-year-old mother who has 
      the genotype 37/51 CAG repeats is clinically unaffected as well. These results 
      suggest an exactly defined border between normal and disease alleles.

TI  - Codon 89 polymorphism in the human 5 alpha-reductase gene in primary breast 
      cancer.
PG  - 760-7
AB  - The enzyme human steroid 5-alpha reductase type II (SRD5A2) and androgen receptor 
      (AR) are critical mediators of androgen action, suggesting a potential role in 
      hormonally related cancers. The SRD5A2 gene harbours two frequent polymorphic 
      sites, one in the coding region, at codon 89 of exon 1, where valine is 
      substituted by leucine (V89L) and the other in the 3' untranslated region (3' 
      UTR) where a variable number of dinucleotide TA repeat lengths exists. The V89L 
      polymorphism is known to alter the activity of this enzyme. In the present study 
      we examined 144 sporadic breast tumours from Italian patients for the V89L and TA 
      polymorphisms by sequence and fragment analysis, respectively. Tumour extract 
      prostate specific antigen (PSA) concentration as well as a number of 
      well-established clinical and pathological parameters were evaluated. The results 
      show that 53% of the tumours were homozygous for VV alleles, 37% were 
      heterozygous for VL alleles and 10% were homozygous for LL alleles. TA(0) repeats 
      were found in tumours with VV, LL and VL genotypes. TA(9) repeats were only found 
      in VV homozygotes and were totally absent from either LL homozygotes or VL 
      heterozygotes. PSA expression was significantly elevated in tumours with VV 
      genotype. The presence of LL alleles in breast tumours is associated with earlier 
      onset and shorter disease-free (RR = 2.65;P = 0.013) and overall survival (RR = 
      3.06;P = 0.014) rates. The VV genotype is associated with a more favourable 
      prognosis. Our study suggests that the polymorphism in codon 89 of exon 1 of the 
      human 5 alpha-reductase gene is related with TA repeat genotypes, PSA expression 
      and breast cancer prognosis. More specifically, we found that the LL genotype is 
      also associated with earlier onset and more aggressive forms of breast cancer. 
      Long-term-outcome studies are needed to investigate the relevance of this 
      polymorphism to breast cancer susceptibility.

TI  - In vivo expansion of trinucleotide repeats yields plasmid and YAC constructs for 
      targeting and transgenesis.
PG  - 383-90
AB  - Production of mouse models of inherited neurodegenerative diseases is an 
      important step towards understanding the mechanism of neurotoxicity and for 
      testing potential therapies. We are interested in creating a mouse model for 
      X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), a neuromuscular disorder 
      caused by expansion of a CAG repeat within the androgen receptor (AR) gene. To 
      permit generation of mice that will show a SBMA phenotype within their life span, 
      we decided to obtain a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) carrying the AR gene and 
      introduce CAG repeat mutations numbering 100 or more triplets. SBMA patients with 
      more than 70 CAGs have never been observed; therefore, we chose to expand a 59 
      CAG repeat tract in vivo in Escherichia coli. Although we set out to expand this 
      repeat tract using a recombination paradigm involving two plasmid co-propagation, 
      we did not observe large expansions. We were instead able to incrementally 
      generate repeat tracts from 100 to 200 CAGs in a yeast integrating plasmid vector 
      by taking advantage of replication instability. In the course of our experiments 
      that yielded these CAG repeat tracts, we evaluated the role of repeat 
      orientation, vector co-propagation, and recA function on the expansion process. 
      We then used one of the yeast integrating vectors to successfully produce an AR 
      YAC construct carrying 100 CAG repeats. AR YAC CAG100 will serve as a valuable 
      reagent for the production of a SBMA mouse.

TI  - Androgen-receptor gene CAG repeats, plasma testosterone levels, and risk of 
      hepatitis B-related hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 2023-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Worldwide, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is more prevalent in men 
      than in women, suggesting that sex hormones and/or X-chromosome-linked genes may 
      be involved in hepatocarcinogenesis. We investigated the association of a 
      trinucleotide (CAG) repeat in the androgen receptor (AR) gene (located on the X 
      chromosome) termed "AR-CAG repeats," levels of plasma testosterone, and the risk 
      of HCC in Taiwanese men. Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, which is 
      associated with risk of HCC, is hyperendemic in Taiwan. METHODS: We compared the 
      number of AR-CAG repeats in 285 HBV carriers with HCC and in 349 HBV carriers 
      without HCC. We also conducted a nested case--control study on participants in a 
      cohort study. Blood was collected prospectively from 110 case patients and 239 
      control subjects and was used to determine the number of AR-CAG repeats and 
      plasma testosterone level. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: The 
      overall odds ratio (OR) for HCC was 1.72 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 
      1.03--2.89) for HBV carriers with 20 or fewer AR-CAG repeats compared with those 
      with more than 24 repeats. This association was observed only in patients with 
      late-onset HCC (OR = 2.37; 95% CI = 1.28--4.38). In the nested case-control 
      study, HBV carriers in the highest tertile of testosterone levels had a 
      statistically significantly increased risk of HCC (OR = 2.06; 95% CI = 
      1.14--3.70) compared with those in the lowest tertile. Elevated testosterone was 
      more strongly associated with early-onset (OR = 4.67; 95% CI = 1.41--15.38) than 
      late-onset disease. HBV carriers with 20 or fewer AR-CAG repeats and higher 
      testosterone levels had a fourfold increase in HCC risk compared with those with 
      more than 24 repeats and testosterone levels in the lowest tertile. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Higher levels of androgen signaling, reflected by higher testosterone levels and 
      20 or fewer AR-CAG repeats, may be associated with an increased risk of 
      HBV-related HCC in men.

TI  - Polymorphic CAG and GGN repeat lengths in the androgen receptor gene and prostate 
      cancer risk: a population-based case-control study in China.
PG  - 5111-6
AB  - The length of the polymorphic CAG trinucleotide repeat in the polyglutamine 
      region of the androgen receptor (AR) gene is inversely correlated with the 
      transactivation function of the AR. Because increased androgenic activity has 
      been linked to prostate cancer and because an ethnic variation exists in the CAG 
      repeat length, this polymorphism has been suggested to explain part of the 
      substantial racial difference in prostate cancer risk. We conducted a 
      population-based case-control study in China to investigate whether CAG and other 
      polymorphisms of the AR gene are associated with clinically significant prostate 
      cancer in this low-risk population. Genomic DNA from 190 prostate cancer patients 
      and 304 healthy controls was used for direct sequencing to evaluate the 
      relationship of CAG and GGN (polyglycine) repeat length in the AR gene. Relative 
      to western men, our study subjects had a longer CAG repeat length, with a median 
      of 23 and only 10% of the subjects having a CAG repeat length shorter than 20. 
      Men with a CAG repeat length shorter than 23 (median length) had a 65% increased 
      risk of prostate cancer (odds ratio, 1.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-2.39), 
      compared with men with a CAG repeat length of 23 or longer. For the GGN tract 
      (GGT3GGG1GGT2GGCn), based on the sequencing results from 481 samples, we are the 
      first to show that although GGC regions in the polyglycine tract are highly 
      variable, there are no mutations or polymorphisms in the GGT and GGG regions. 
      More than 72% of the subjects had a GGN repeat length of 23, and those with a GGN 
      repeat length shorter than 23 had a 12% increased risk of prostate cancer (95% 
      confidence interval, 0.71-1.78), compared with those with > or = 23 GGN repeats. 
      Our study not only confirms that Chinese men do have a longer CAG repeat length 
      than western men but also represents the first population-based study to show 
      that even in a very low-risk population, a shorter CAG repeat length confers a 
      higher risk of clinically significant prostate cancer. These results imply that 
      CAG repeat length can potentially serve as a useful marker to identify a subset 
      of individuals at higher risk of developing clinically significant prostate 
      cancer. Larger studies are needed to evaluate the combined effect of CAG and GGN 
      repeats. Because of the significance of AR in prostate cancer, investigation of 
      factors that interact with the polyglutamine region of the AR gene to alter AR 
      function and modulate prostate cancer risk is an important area for future 
      research.

TI  - Androgen receptor gene CAG trinucleotide repeats in anovulatory infertility and 
      polycystic ovaries.
PG  - 3484-8
AB  - Hyperandrogenism is currently thought to be central to the pathogenesis of 
      polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), a common endocrine disorder in premenopausal 
      women characterized by irregular menstruation and anovulatory infertility. 
      Although hyperandrogenism is characteristic, some women with PCOS have normal 
      serum androgen levels. All androgens act through the X-linked androgen receptor 
      (AR), the N-terminal domain of which contains a polyglutamine tract encoded by a 
      highly polymorphic CAG trinucleotide repeat tract. Recently, variations in this 
      CAG microsatellite tract, while remaining within the normal polymorphic range 
      (11-38 CAGs), have been inversely correlated with receptor activity. Thus, short 
      tracts are associated with high intrinsic AR activity and increased severity and 
      earlier age of onset of the androgen-regulated tumor prostate cancer, whereas 
      longer CAG tracts are associated with low AR activity and oligospermic 
      infertility. To investigate the role of the CAG repeat tract in PCOS, we measured 
      its length in 91 patients with ultrasound diagnosis of polycystic ovaries, 
      irregular menstrual cycles, and anovulatory infertility and compared them to 112 
      control subjects of proven fertility with regular menses. Fluorescent-labeled DNA 
      fragments containing the CAG repeat tract were amplified from leucocytic DNA, and 
      their lengths were compared with internal size markers on an automated DNA 
      Sequencer. There were no differences in the mean CAG length between patients and 
      controls when both alleles were considered together or separately. Because there 
      is a subset of PCOS patients whose serum androgens are normal, we compared 
      differences in CAG length between patients whose serum testosterone (T) levels 
      were below the normal laboratory mean, to those that were higher. There was a 
      trend for a lower mean CAG biallelic length among anovulatory patients with T 
      less than 1.73 nmol/L compared with those whose T was more than 1.73 nmol/L 
      (22.47 +/- 0.36 vs. 23.25 +/- 0.29). This difference in CAG length between 
      patients with low and high T levels (20.38 +/- 0.51 vs. 21.98 +/- 0.29) was 
      highly significant (P = 0.004) when only the shorter allele of each individual 
      was considered. Ethnic differences were also evident in our data; Indian subjects 
      had a significantly shorter AR-CAG length compared with Chinese, being 22.08 +/- 
      0.50 and 23.16 +/- 0.17, respectively. Our data indicate an association between 
      short CAG repeat length and the subset of anovulatory patients with low serum 
      androgens, suggesting that the pathogenic mechanism of polycystic ovaries in 
      these patients could be due to the increased intrinsic androgenic activity 
      associated with short AR alleles.

TI  - CREB-binding protein sequestration by expanded polyglutamine.
PG  - 2197-202
AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is one of eight inherited 
      neurodegenerative diseases known to be caused by CAG repeat expansion. The 
      expansion results in an expanded polyglutamine tract, which likely confers a 
      novel, toxic function to the affected protein. Cell culture and transgenic mouse 
      studies have implicated the nucleus as a site for pathogenesis, suggesting that a 
      critical nuclear factor or process is disrupted by the polyglutamine expansion. 
      In this report we present evidence that CREB-binding protein (CBP), a 
      transcriptional co-activator that orchestrates nuclear response to a variety of 
      cell signaling cascades, is incorporated into nuclear inclusions formed by 
      polyglutamine-containing proteins in cultured cells, transgenic mice and tissue 
      from patients with SBMA. We also show CBP incorporation into nuclear inclusions 
      formed in a cell culture model of another polyglutamine disease, spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 3. We present evidence that soluble levels of CBP are reduced in 
      cells expressing expanded polyglutamine despite increased levels of CBP mRNA. 
      Finally, we demonstrate that over-expression of CBP rescues cells from 
      polyglutamine-mediated toxicity in neuronal cell culture. These data support a 
      CBP-sequestration model of polyglutamine expansion disease.

TI  - CAG trinucleotide repeats in the androgen receptor gene of infertile men exhibit 
      stable inheritance in female offspring conceived after ICSI.
PG  - 861-6
AB  - The androgen receptor (AR) gene is located on the X chromosome and contains a 
      polymorphic CAG tract. CAG repeat expansions in the AR have been associated with 
      male infertility and the neuromuscular disease, spinal bulbar muscular atrophy 
      (SBMA). Based on Mendelian inheritance patterns, moderate CAG expansions in 
      infertile men treated by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) would be 
      vertically transmitted to female offspring. Should further elongation of the 
      repeat region occur in the male germline, it is conceivable that longer 
      expansions could also be transmitted by ICSI and may lead to an increased 
      incidence of male infertility and SBMA in succeeding generations. To determine 
      the degree of stability of the paternal AR CAG tract following ICSI, we compared 
      the CAG repeat number in the AR alleles of 92 men presenting for ICSI and their 
      99 ICSI-conceived daughters. CAG repeat lengths in the AR alleles were determined 
      by fluorescent polymerase chain reaction and Genescan analysis of amplification 
      products separated on DNA sequencing gels. In the vast majority of cases (95 out 
      of 99), we found that the AR CAG tracts ranging in size from 15-28 repeats 
      exhibited stable inheritance in female offspring. However, in the remaining 
      father-daughter pairs, there was a discordance in the expected inheritance 
      pattern with evidence for both CAG expansion (20-->24; 22-->23) and contraction 
      (26-->18 or 22) of the paternal AR allele. The detection of a low frequency of 
      CAG mutation in paternal AR alleles following ICSI would be consistent with 
      gonadal mosaicism originating from meiotic DNA replication errors. These findings 
      in a typical group of infertile men undergoing ICSI for a variety of indications 
      tend to alleviate concerns that ICSI may promote the transmission of AR alleles 
      with expanded CAG tracts and suggest that the risk of SBMA in second generation 
      sons would be extremely low.

TI  - Polymorphic CAG repeats of the androgen receptor gene in Japanese male patients 
      with ankylosing spondylitis.
PG  - 530-2
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In view of a possible role of androgens in the pathogenesis of 
      ankylosing spondylitis (AS), we investigated the association between Japanese 
      male patients with AS and CAG microsatellites of the androgen receptor (AR) gene 
      which related to the AR transactivation function. METHODS: Peripheral blood was 
      collected from 39 men with AS and 305 male control subjects. The number of CAG 
      repeats in exon 1 of the AR gene was determined. RESULTS: CAG repeat lengths in 
      AS patients were significantly shorter than those in the controls (median value 
      22 vs 23; P = 0.03). However, there was no significant difference in CAG repeats 
      between HLA-B27-positive and -negative patients (median value 22 vs 22; P = 
      0.78). CONCLUSIONS: Shorter CAG repeats of the AR gene, presenting high levels of 
      transactivation activity, may play a role in male AS.

TI  - Molecular evidence that the stromal and epithelial cells in pleomorphic adenomas 
      of salivary gland arise from the same origin: clonal analysis using human 
      androgen receptor gene (HUMARA) assay.
PG  - 498-503
AB  - Salivary gland pleomorphic adenomas are characterized by a biphasic growth of 
      "epithelial" and "stromal" regions. The "epithelial" region is a compactly 
      organized mixture of both luminal and nonluminal cells, whereas the stromal 
      region is composed predominantly of the nonluminal cells. Using the polymerase 
      chain reaction (PCR)-based HUMARA assay on DNA from formalin-fixed, 
      paraffin-embedded tissues from pleomorphic adnomas of female patients, we intend 
      to clarify the clonal relation between the luminal and nonluminal cells and the 
      clonal nature of the morphologically diverse nonluminal cells in this tumor. 
      HUMARA, the human androgen receptor gene, is located on the X chromosome and 
      contains a segment of polymorphic CAG tandem repeats in exon 1. Several 
      methylation-sensitive HhaI restriction sites are located 5' to these CAG repeats. 
      It is an ideal tool to study clonality of female tissues by examining the 
      methylation pattern. Of the 13 cases analyzed, 3 were homozygous at the HUMARA 
      locus and therefore noninformative. The remaining 10 cases were informative. All 
      10 cases showed a monoclonal pattern in the stromal area, indicating that the 
      morphologically diverse nonluminal cells are monoclonal. Eight of the 10 cases 
      showed monoclonality in the "epithelial" areas, suggesting a common clonality 
      between luminal and nonluminal cells. Of the remaining 2 samples, 1 was 
      polyclonal for the "epithelial" region, and the other was not amplifiable. Our 
      data provide the first molecular evidence that the luminal and nonluminal cells 
      in pleomorphic adenomas arise from the same clone in most cases, and the 
      morphologically diverse nonluminal cells are monoclonal.

TI  - Shorter CAG repeat length in the androgen receptor gene is associated with more 
      aggressive forms of breast cancer.
PG  - 153-61
AB  - The androgen receptor (AR) is a transcription factor mediating the action of 
      androgens. The AR gene is localized on chromosome X and it contains a series of 
      CAG trinucleotide repeats. The length of the CAG repeats varies among individuals 
      and this polymorphism is believed to be related to AR transcriptional activity. 
      Studies have shown that fewer CAG repeats are associated with an increased risk 
      as well as more aggressive forms of prostate cancer. Although AR is expressed in 
      breast cancer and the impact of androgen and AR on breast cancer has been 
      recognized, the role of the CAG repeats in breast cancer remains unknown. In this 
      study, we measured the CAG repeats in breast cancer tissue using a PCR-based 
      method. Of the 133 patients with primary breast cancer, 102 were heterozygous and 
      31 were homozygous. The mean CAG repeat number for homozygous women was 21; for 
      heterozygous women the repeat number mean was 20 for the short allele and 24 for 
      the long allele. The length of CAG repeats either in one allele or in both 
      alleles was inversely correlated with the histological grade of breast cancer (r 
      = -0.23 or -0.26, respectively, p < 0.05). An association between positive lymph 
      nodes and fewer CAG repeats in both alleles was also suggested (p = 0.06). 
      Furthermore, survival analysis indicated that the total number of CAG repeats in 
      both alleles was associated with patient overall survival. With every CAG repeat 
      increase, there was a 6% reduction in the risk of death (RR = 0.94, p = 0.03). 
      The association remained significant after controlling for the homozygous and 
      heterozygous status (RR = 0.92, p = 0.01). The association became no longer 
      significant when clinical and pathological variables were adjusted in the 
      analysis but this could be due to the reduction of sample size in the 
      multivariate analysis. CAG heterozygosity and difference in number of CAG repeats 
      between the two alleles were not associated with either disease features or 
      patient survival. Our results suggest that longer CAG repeats may occur more 
      frequently in less aggressive cancer and that the CAG repeats may play a role in 
      breast cancer progression.

TI  - The polymorphic exon 1 androgen receptor CAG repeat in men with a potential 
      inherited predisposition to prostate cancer.
PG  - 439-42
AB  - Recent studies have provided epidemiological evidence in support of a possible 
      prostate cancer susceptibility locus on the X chromosome. The androgen receptor 
      (AR) gene, located at Xq11-12, has been implicated as a risk factor for the 
      development of prostate cancer. To examine the potential role of the AR locus in 
      prostate cancer susceptibility, the AR CAG repeat length was measured in 270 
      Caucasian men with prostate cancer from 133 unrelated families. Each of these 
      families has two or more confirmed cases of prostate cancer occurring in first- 
      and/or second-degree relatives. No evidence for linkage of the AR gene to 
      prostate cancer was observed. We tested for the previously reported association 
      of short CAG alleles with prostate cancer using t tests, Pearson's chi2 tests, 
      and logistic regression; analyses were subsequently repeated to incorporate only 
      men with moderate- to high-grade prostate cancer. No association between AR CAG 
      allele length and prostate cancer was detected when either a subset of unrelated 
      patients or a subset of unrelated patients with moderate- to high-grade cancer 
      was compared with a set of unrelated controls. We failed to detect an association 
      between short AR CAG alleles and early age of prostate cancer diagnosis. Once 
      specific hereditary prostate cancer genes have been identified, future studies 
      can more carefully delineate the potential role of this AR polymorphism as a 
      modifier locus in high-risk families.

TI  - The mutation properties of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy disease alleles.
PG  - 249-52
AB  - We studied the gene for the trinucleotide repeat disorder X-linked spinal and 
      bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) to quantify the spectrum of mutations and gain 
      insight into genetic anticipation. This analysis was performed using single sperm 
      typing from an affected individual. This method allows the quantification of 
      large numbers of meioses and therefore provides accurate information about 
      genetic instability of the CAG repeat expansions which cause SBMA. Among 198 X 
      chromosome-containing sperm cells, 20% had a CAG repeat number equal to the 
      donor's somatic DNA of 49 CAG repeats, 56% were expansions, and 24% contractions. 
      Most of the expansions (84%) and contractions (94%) were between 1 and 3 CAG 
      repeats. These results are consistent with those obtained from one previously 
      studied SBMA patient and reveal greater CAG repeat instability in sperm than in 
      somatic tissue. Our results indicate that in SBMA, in contrast to sperm typing 
      analysis of Huntington's disease, there is relative stability of the CAG repeat 
      number during paternal transmissions and that the spectrum of mutations is 
      narrow. These results are in agreement with the limited available clinical data 
      and suggest that anticipation may not be a significant feature of this disease.

TI  - Desmoids in familial adenomatous polyposis are monoclonal proliferations.
PG  - 827-32
AB  - Desmoids are poorly-understood, locally aggressive, non-metastasizing 
      fibromatoses that occur with disproportionate frequency in patients with familial 
      adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Their nature is controversial with arguments for and 
      against a neoplastic origin. Neoplastic proliferations are by definition 
      monoclonal, whereas reactive processes originate from a polyclonal background. We 
      examined clonality of 25 samples of desmoid tissue from 11 female FAP patients by 
      assessing patterns of X-chromosome inactivation to calculate a clonality ratio. 
      Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of a polymorphic CAG short tandem 
      repeat (STR) sequence adjacent to a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme site 
      within the human androgen receptor (HUMARA) gene using fluorescent-labelled 
      primers enabled analysis of PCR products by Applied Biosystems Genescan II 
      software. Twenty-one samples from nine patients were informative for the assay. 
      Samples from all informative cases comprised a median of 66% (range 0-75%) clonal 
      cells but from the six patients with a clonality ratio < or =0.5 comprised a 
      median of 71% (65-75%) clonal cells. FAP-associated desmoid tumours are true 
      neoplasms. This may have implications in the development of improved treatment 
      protocols for patients with these aggressive tumours.

TI  - The androgen receptor exon 1 trinucleotide repeat does not act as a modifier of 
      the age of presentation in breast cancer.
PG  - 533-4
AB  - The CAG repeat in exon 1 of the androgen receptor (AR) genes has been postulated 
      as both a susceptibility allele and phenotypic modifier in BRCA1-associated 
      breast cancers. We have analysed this repeat in a set of 178 breast cancer cases 
      who have been selected only for age of presentation at 65 years or less. No 
      effect of repeat length on age of presentation was found and there was no 
      association between repeat length and family history. In combination with the 
      data from other workers, our findings suggest that the androgen receptor repeat 
      does not act as a modifier gene or susceptibility locus outside the context of 
      the hereditary breast/ovarian cancer syndrome.

TI  - Effects of heat shock, heat shock protein 40 (HDJ-2), and proteasome inhibition 
      on protein aggregation in cellular models of Huntington's disease.
PG  - 2898-903
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD), spinocerebellar ataxias types 1 and 3 (SCA1, SCA3), 
      and spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) are caused by CAG/polyglutamine expansion 
      mutations. A feature of these diseases is ubiquitinated intraneuronal inclusions 
      derived from the mutant proteins, which colocalize with heat shock proteins 
      (HSPs) in SCA1 and SBMA and proteasomal components in SCA1, SCA3, and SBMA. 
      Previous studies suggested that HSPs might protect against inclusion formation, 
      because overexpression of HDJ-2/HSDJ (a human HSP40 homologue) reduced ataxin-1 
      (SCA1) and androgen receptor (SBMA) aggregate formation in HeLa cells. We 
      investigated these phenomena by transiently transfecting part of huntingtin exon 
      1 in COS-7, PC12, and SH-SY5Y cells. Inclusion formation was not seen with 
      constructs expressing 23 glutamines but was repeat length and time dependent for 
      mutant constructs with 43-74 repeats. HSP70, HSP40, the 20S proteasome and 
      ubiquitin colocalized with inclusions. Treatment with heat shock and lactacystin, 
      a proteasome inhibitor, increased the proportion of mutant huntingtin exon 
      1-expressing cells with inclusions. Thus, inclusion formation may be enhanced in 
      polyglutamine diseases, if the pathological process results in proteasome 
      inhibition or a heat-shock response. Overexpression of HDJ-2/HSDJ did not modify 
      inclusion formation in PC12 and SH-SY5Y cells but increased inclusion formation 
      in COS-7 cells. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an HSP increasing 
      aggregation of an abnormally folded protein in mammalian cells and expands the 
      current understanding of the roles of HDJ-2/HSDJ in protein folding.

TI  - Length rather than a specific allele of dinucleotide repeat in the 5' upstream 
      region of the aldose reductase gene is associated with diabetic retinopathy.
PG  - 1044-7
AB  - AIMS: To assess the possible contribution of a genetic factor to diabetic 
      retinopathy. METHODS: (CA)n repeat length was investigated in the 5' upstream 
      region of the gene coding for aldose reductase (AR), which is a key enzyme of the 
      polyol pathway and plays a role in hyperglycaemia-induced tissue damage, in 
      Japanese patients with Type 2 DM. RESULTS: The dinucleotide repeat length was 
      significantly associated with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) (P= 0.029, 
      Mann-Whitney U-test); i.e. shorter alleles were more prevalent in the PDR group 
      than in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: (CA)n repeat length, rather than a 
      specific allele, in the 5' upstream region of the AR gene is associated with 
      diabetic retinopathy. These data suggest that the AR locus plays a role in 
      genetic susceptibility to diabetic retinopathy and that dinucleotide repeats in 
      genomic DNA may be related to disease predisposition.

TI  - Polyglutamine repeat length influences human androgen receptor/c-Jun mediated 
      transcription.
PG  - 9-12
AB  - The androgen receptor and c-Jun are known to interact to modulate each others 
      transcriptional activities. The androgen receptor contains a polymorphic 
      polyglutamine repeat and expansion of this repeat to beyond approximately 40 
      causes spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA; also known as Kennedy's disease), a 
      genetic form of motor neurone disease. Here we show that the size of this 
      polyglutamine tract influences both c-Jun regulation of androgen 
      receptor-mediated transcription and androgen receptor regulation of c-Jun 
      activity. c-Jun is a key mediator of neuronal survival and death by apoptosis. 
      Inappropriate interactions between c-Jun and androgen receptors containing 
      pathological length glutamine repeats may therefore be part of the pathogenic 
      process in SBMA.

TI  - Clonality analysis by methylation-specific PCR for the human androgen-receptor 
      gene (HUMARA-MSP).
PG  - 207-12
AB  - The human androgen-receptor gene (HUMARA) has been used for analysis of X 
      chromosome inactivation (XCI) pattern because of a polymorphic short tandem 
      repeat (STR) near the 5'-promoter region correlated with XCI. We introduce a 
      novel method to analyze XCI pattern, named HUMARA methylation-specific PCR 
      (HUMARA-MSP) assay, which analyzes methylation status of the HUMARA gene by 
      bisulfite modification instead of a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme. 
      Although the original MSP method shows whether there is a methylated band or not, 
      our HUMARA-MSP method identifies the patterns of methylated and unmethylated 
      bands. Because this method identifies either unmethylated or methylated alleles 
      in each PCR tube and shows opposite band patterns dependent on methylation 
      status, we can assess the XCI pattern independently twice. This method can avoid 
      false results by incomplete enzyme digestion and incomplete bisulfite 
      modification will not affect the results. Extremely small quantities of samples, 
      such as hematopoietic colonies, were also available for HUMARA-MSP assay. Because 
      DNA modified by sodium bisulfite is also available for assessment of methylation 
      status of other genes by setting specific primers for them, we performed the 
      simultaneous assessment of clonality and aberrant hypermethylation of p15INK4B 
      gene in myelodysplastic syndromes. These simultaneous assessments were easily 
      possible and provided much information despite requiring only a small volume of 
      DNA. The HUMARA-MSP assay may facilitate the analyses for pathogenesis of 
      hematological disorders because of its simplicity, sensitivity and wide 
      applicability. Leukemia (2000) 14, 207-212.

TI  - Exclusion of AR-CHED from the chromosome 20 region containing the PPMD and 
      AD-CHED loci.
PG  - 243-9
AB  - Congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED) is a disorder of the corneal 
      endothelium and has been recognized to segregate in families with both autosomal 
      dominant (AD) and autosomal recessive (AR) modes of transmission. AD-CHED has 
      been previously linked to the pericentric region of chromosome 20. Posterior 
      polymorphous dystrophy (PPMD), a corneal endothelial disorder showing phenotypic 
      overlap with CHED, has also been previously genetically mapped to this region. 
      The genetic interval containing AD-CHED is within the larger genetic interval 
      containing the PPMD locus. This study sought to determine whether AR-CHED 
      segregating in a consanguineous Saudi Arabian pedigree is linked to the 
      previously mapped and overlapping loci for AD-CHED and PPMD on the pericentric 
      region of chromosome 20. Forty members of a consanguineous Saudi Arabian pedigree 
      segregating AR-CHED were ascertained. Short tandem-repeat polymorphic markers 
      from the 20 cM interval on chromosome 20 containing both the PPMD and AD-CHED 
      loci were used to genotype these individuals. LOD score analysis of the genotype 
      data with the MENDEL software package utilizing a model of autosomal recessive 
      inheritance with complete penetrance showed exclusion of CHED from the entire 
      PPMD/AD-CHED interval by utilizing overlapping intervals of LOD scores of at 
      least -2. The results obtained demonstrate that AR-CHED is not allelic to either 
      AD-CHED or PPMD, although it has been proposed that AD-CHED may be allelic to 
      PPMD. Thus, there are at least two genes responsible for CHED and PPMD.

TI  - CAG repeat length in the androgen receptor gene is related to age at diagnosis of 
      prostate cancer and response to endocrine therapy, but not to prostate cancer 
      risk.
PG  - 672-6
AB  - The length of the polymorphic CAG repeat in the N-terminal of the androgen 
      receptor (AR) gene is inversely correlated with the transactivation function of 
      the AR. Some studies have indicated that short CAG repeats are related to higher 
      risk of prostate cancer. We performed a case-control study to investigate 
      relations between CAG repeat length and prostate cancer risk, tumour grade, 
      tumour stage, age at diagnosis and response to endocrine therapy. The study 
      included 190 AR alleles from prostate cancer patients and 186 AR alleles from 
      female control subjects. All were whites from southern Sweden. The frequency 
      distribution of CAG repeat length was strikingly similar for cases and controls, 
      and no significant correlation between CAG repeat length and prostate cancer risk 
      was detected. However, for men with non-hereditary prostate cancer (n = 160), 
      shorter CAG repeats correlated with younger age at diagnosis (P = 0.03). There 
      were also trends toward associations between short CAG repeats and high grade (P 
      = 0.07) and high stage (P = 0.07) disease. Furthermore, we found that patients 
      with long CAG repeats responded better to endocrine therapy, even after adjusting 
      for pretreatment level of prostate-specific antigen and tumour grade and stage (P 
      = 0.05). We conclude that short CAG repeats in the AR gene correlate with young 
      age at diagnosis of prostate cancer, but not with higher risk of the disease. 
      Selection of patients with early onset prostate cancer in case-control studies 
      could therefore lead to an over-estimation of the risk of prostate cancer for men 
      with short CAG repeats. An association between long CAG repeats and good response 
      to endocrine therapy was also found, but the mechanism and clinical relevance are 
      unclear.

TI  - Trinucleotide repeat polymorphism at five disease loci in mixed Hungarian 
      population.
PG  - 245-50
AB  - In apparently healthy, unrelated Hungarians we examined triplet repeat length 
      polymorphism at Huntington disease (HD), spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy 
      (SBMA), spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA-1), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA), and myotonic dystrophy (MD) loci. The distribution of alleles of 
      the SCA-1 locus was markedly different compared with Asians and Caucasian samples 
      examined by Watkins WS, Bamshad M, and Jorde LB [1995: Hum Mol Genet 
      4:1485-1491]. The unimodal distribution of peaks was shifted towards the shorter 
      repeats on the average with 4-5 repeats. Alleles under 21 repeats at the SBMA 
      locus were significantly less frequent in Hungarians than in Asians and 
      Caucasians. We also found significant difference in the distribution of DRPLA 
      allele size at repeat length over 15 repeats; these alleles were less frequent in 
      Hungarians compared with Asians and Caucasians. No significant differences were 
      found in alleles at the MD and also at the HD loci compared with the other 
      groups. These findings suggest that these trinucleotide sites in combination with 
      other markers are particularly useful for determination of the genetic origin of 
      a population, if they can be compared with similar subset of data of other 
      populations. The present results could not confirm the large genetic distance 
      between Hungarian and Oriental races and the relatively short distance between 
      Hungarian and other European populations suggested in earlier reports [Czeizel A, 
      Benkmann H-G, Goedde HW, editors. 1991: Genetics of the Hungarian population. 
      Budapest: Akademiai Kiado. p 82-334].

TI  - Androgen receptor CAG repeat length polymorphism in benign prostatic hyperplasia 
      (BPH): correlation with adenoma growth.
PG  - 253-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The androgen receptor (AR) gene has a polymorphic CAG microsatellite 
      encoding variable-length glutamine repeats in the AR protein. The purpose of this 
      study was to evaluate the association between the growth of benign prostatic 
      hyperplasia (BPH) and the AR gene CAG repeat length. METHODS: We determined CAG 
      repeat lengths in 176 BPH patients who underwent simple prostatectomy and in 41 
      control subjects without benign prostatic enlargement (non-BPE group). RESULTS: A 
      statistically significant (P < 0.02) trend for large adenoma size with short CAG 
      repeat length was found among the adenoma quartiles. CAG repeat length in the 
      fourth quartile (large adenoma, 21.5 +/- 2.7) was significantly shorter than in 
      the first quartile (small adenoma, 23.3 +/- 2.1, P < 0.02). It tended to be 
      shorter than in the non-BPE group (23.1 +/- 2.4), but CAG repeat lengths in the 
      entire BPH (22.4 +/- 2.5) and non-BPE groups did not significantly differ. The 
      relative risk of large BPH (the fourth quartile) was 2.75 (95% confidence 
      interval, 1.05-7.24; P < 0.05) on comparing CAG repeats of < or = 22-> or = 23. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Shorter CAG alleles may be a genetic factor that promotes the growth 
      of BPH.

TI  - Tissue-specific somatic mosaicism in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy is 
      dependent on CAG-repeat length and androgen receptor--gene expression level.
PG  - 966-73
AB  - The factors influencing the tissue-specific pattern of somatic mosaicism in 
      CAG-repeat diseases have not yet been fully resolved. We performed a detailed 
      analysis of the degree of somatic mosaicism in various tissues from 20 patients 
      with spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), including 4 who were deceased. 
      The most outstanding feature was the prominent somatic mosaicism observed in the 
      cardiac and skeletal muscles, composed predominantly of postmitotic cells, and in 
      the skin, prostate, and testis. The CNS tissues, liver, and spleen showed the 
      least mosaicism. The tissue distribution of somatic mosaicism in patients with 
      SBMA was markedly different from that in patients with Huntington disease (HD) 
      and from that in patients with dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). The 
      degree of somatic mosaicism correlated with the CAG-repeat number but not with 
      age at examination. Furthermore, tissues with a higher mosaicism level 
      corresponded well to those with a higher expression level of androgen receptor 
      protein. The tissue-specific pattern of somatic mosaicism related not only to 
      cell composition with different cell turnover rates but to repeat size and gene 
      expression levels, and postnatal cell division is unlikely to be a major cause of 
      somatic mosaicism probably because of the relative stability of CAG repeat in 
      SBMA.

TI  - Polymorphic CAG repeats of the androgen receptor gene and rheumatoid arthritis.
PG  - 500-2
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In view of the possible role of androgens in the pathogenesis of 
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA), this study investigated the association between repeat 
      lengths of CAG microsatellites of the androgen receptor (AR) gene and RA. 
      METHODS: The number of CAG repeats in exon 1 of the AR gene was determined in 90 
      men and 276 women with RA, as well as in 305 male and 332 female controls. 
      RESULTS: The male RA patients tended to have shorter repeats than the male 
      controls (22.5 versus 23.1, p=0.07), whereas the female RA patients had similar 
      repeats to the female controls (22.7 versus 22.9, p=0.17). Patients of both sexes 
      were divided into younger and older age at onset groups, and compared with 
      younger and older controls. Younger onset male RA patients had significantly 
      shorter CAG repeat lengths than the younger male controls (21.8 versus 23.2, 
      p=0.007) or the older onset male RA patients (21.8 versus 23.2, p=0.04). Older 
      onset male RA and both younger and older onset female RA patients had similar CAG 
      repeat lengths when compared with their controls. Neither seropositivity nor 
      rheumatoid nodule positivity had a significant relation with CAG repeat lengths. 
      CONCLUSION: Shorter CAG repeats of the AR gene, presenting high levels of 
      transactivation activity, are related to younger age onset male RA, suggesting 
      the possible role of androgens as a modulating factor.

TI  - The linkage of Kennedy's neuron disease to ARA24, the first identified androgen 
      receptor polyglutamine region-associated coactivator.
PG  - 20229-34
AB  - Although the linkage of polyglutamine (poly-Q) repeat expansion in the androgen 
      receptor (AR) to Kennedy's disease (X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy) 
      was a major step forward, the detailed molecular mechanism of how the change in 
      poly-Q length contributes to the disease remains unclear. Here we report the 
      identification of a nuclear G-protein, Ras-related nuclear protein/ARA24, as the 
      first AR coactivator that can bind differentially with different lengths of 
      poly-Q within AR. In the yeast and mammalian reciprocal interacting assays, our 
      data suggested the interaction of AR N-terminal domain with ARA24 diminishes as 
      the poly-Q length increases. The coactivation of ARA24 also diminishes with the 
      poly-Q expansion within AR. Deletion of the acidic hexapeptide (DEDDDL) at the C 
      terminus of ARA24 further enhances its AR coactivation. Together, our data 
      suggest that poor interaction and weaker coactivation of ARA24 to the longer 
      poly-Q AR in the X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophied AR could 
      contribute to the weaker transactivation of AR. The consequence of poor 
      interaction and weak coactivation may eventually lead to the partial androgen 
      insensitivity during the development of Kennedy's disease.

TI  - Significance of the CAG repeat length in the androgen receptor gene (AR) for the 
      transactivation function of an M780I mutant AR.
PG  - 257-61
AB  - Mutations in the androgen receptor gene (AR) cause a wide spectrum of androgen 
      insensitivity syndromes (AIS). Mutation analysis of patients with AIS has 
      revealed that the same missense mutation of the AR gene can give rise to strongly 
      divergent phenotypes suggesting the influence of modifying factors. The 
      polymorphic CAG repeat in the first exon of the AR gene may be such a modifying 
      factor. The influence of the length of the CAG repeat on the transactivation 
      function of the M780I-mutant AR (causing partial and complete AIS) has been 
      determined by cotransfection of HeLa cells with various CAG-AR expression vectors 
      and a highly androgen-responsive luciferase reporter gene construct. The 
      transcriptional activity of the M780I mutant AR can be, in contrast to the 
      wild-type AR, considerably enhanced by non-physiologically high androgen 
      concentrations. Furthermore, an inverse relationship between the number of the 
      CAG repeats in the mutant AR and its activity has been observed.

TI  - (CAG)nCAA and GGN repeats in the human androgen receptor gene are not associated 
      with prostate cancer in a French-German population.
PG  - 357-62
AB  - Alleles of the CAG and the GGC repeat in the first exon of the human androgen 
      receptor (AR) gene have been shown to be associated with the risk of (advanced) 
      prostate cancer. These studies had been carried out in the United States. We have 
      analysed these polymorphisms in a French-German collection of 105 controls, 132 
      sporadic cases, and a sample of prostate cancer families comprising 85 affected 
      and 46 not affected family members. The allele distributions were very similar in 
      all four groups and chi square statistics on contingency tables did not detect 
      any significant differences. The relative risk (odds ratio, OR) were calculated 
      using logistic regression and did not reach significance despite sufficient 
      numbers of patients and controls. Typical results were OR = 1.007; 95% Confidence 
      Interval (CI) 0.97-1.1, P = 0.87 for CAG as continuous variable and OR = 1.2 (95% 
      CI 0.7-2.0), P = 0.47 for CAG classes < 22 and > = 22 repeats. Similar results 
      were obtained for subgroups defined by age or Gleason score. We conclude that 
      these polymorphisms can not be used as predictive parameters for prostate cancer 
      in the French or German population.

TI  - Polyclonal expansion of cells with trisomy 7 in synovia from patients with 
      osteoarthritis.
PG  - 30-4
AB  - Trisomy 7 as the single chromosome aberration has been found in a variety of 
      neoplasms and in normal tissue in the proximity of tumors, as well as in 
      non-neoplastic lesions. Recently, we described a nonrandom pattern of chromosome 
      aberrations, in particular, a gain of chromosome 7, in synovia, cartilage, and 
      osteophytes from patients with osteoarthritis. To study the clonal origin of 
      trisomy 7 in osteoarthritis, multiple synovial samples were collected from five 
      women, all of whom were informative heterozygotes with regard to the X-linked 
      human androgen receptor gene (AR). From each case, three to four independent cell 
      cultures were initiated. Trisomic cell populations were subcloned from the 
      individual cultures, and it was established whether or not the same allele of AR 
      was inactivated in trisomic cells from different parts of the same joint. The 
      finding of a polyclonal X-inactivation pattern in two of the cases provides 
      strong evidence that gain of an extra copy of chromosome 7 occurs independently 
      in multiple cells.

TI  - Kennedy's disease: caspase cleavage of the androgen receptor is a crucial event 
      in cytotoxicity.
PG  - 185-95
AB  - X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), Kennedy's disease, is a 
      degenerative disease of the motor neurons that is associated with an increase in 
      the number of CAG repeats encoding a polyglutamine stretch within the androgen 
      receptor (AR). Recent work has demonstrated that the gene products associated 
      with open reading frame triplet repeat expansions may be substrates for the 
      cysteine protease cell death executioners, the caspases. However, the role that 
      caspase cleavage plays in the cytotoxicity associated with expression of the 
      disease-associated alleles is unknown. Here, we report the first conclusive 
      evidence that caspase cleavage is a critical step in cytotoxicity; the expression 
      of the AR with an expanded polyglutamine stretch enhances its ability to induce 
      apoptosis when compared with the normal AR. The AR is cleaved by a caspase-3 
      subfamily protease at Asp146, and this cleavage is increased during apoptosis. 
      Cleavage of the AR at Asp146 is critical for the induction of apoptosis by AR, as 
      mutation of the cleavage site blocks the ability of the AR to induce cell death. 
      Further, mutation of the caspase cleavage site at Asp146 blocks the ability of 
      the SBMA AR to form perinuclear aggregates. These studies define a fundamental 
      role for caspase cleavage in the induction of neural cell death by proteins 
      displaying expanded polyglutamine tracts, and therefore suggest a strategy that 
      may be useful to treat neurodegenerative diseases associated with polyglutamine 
      repeat expansions.

TI  - X chromosome inactivation patterns in normal females.
PG  - 439-47
AB  - Since one of the two X chromosomes is randomly inactivated at an early stage of 
      female embryonic development, X-linked markers have been used to study the origin 
      and development of various neoplastic disorders in affected heterozygous women; 
      clonality assays have provided a useful tool to the understanding of the 
      mechanisms underlying the development of neoplasia. Recently, a technique of 
      clonal analysis has been devised that takes advantage of a highly polymorphic 
      short tandem repeat within the X-linked human androgen receptor (AR) gene, 
      resulting in a heterozygosity rate approaching 90%. The rapid expansion of the 
      number of women now suitable for X inactivation analysis has however given rise 
      to new controversies, one of the more troublesome being the possibility of a 
      modification of the pattern of X- chromosome inactivation pattern in blood cells 
      of elderly women. In the present study we analyze with the AR assay a group of 
      166 healthy females aged between 8 and 94 years, with no history of genetic or 
      neoplastic familial disorders. We failed to find any correlation between age and 
      X- chromosome inactivation pattern (r = 0.17), even subdividing the subjects in 
      different age groups according to the criteria used by other researchers, and 
      therefore reaffirm that, when tested for with well-standardized and accurate 
      criteria, extremely unbalanced inactivation of the X chromosome is a truly 
      uncommon phenomenon in normal women.

TI  - Androgen receptor variants with short glutamine or glycine repeats may identify 
      unique subpopulations of men with prostate cancer.
PG  - 1599-608
AB  - The androgen receptor (AR) contains glutamine (CAG) and glycine (GGC) repeats 
      that are each polymorphic in length. We screened clinically localized prostate 
      cancers for somatic mutations in the length of the CAG and GGC repeats in the AR 
      gene and characterized the length of these repeats in the germ-line AR gene. 
      Somatic mutations were rare, and the range of germ-line repeat lengths in men 
      with prostate cancer was within the range of normal in the general population. 
      Most allele frequencies in Caucasian men with clinical prostate cancer were 
      remarkably comparable to those in the general Caucasian population. However, a 
      subpopulation of the men with clinical prostate cancer had a substantially higher 
      frequency of AR alleles with 16 or 17 CAGs (6 of 59 men, 10%) than did the 
      general population (6 of 370 alleles, 1.6%), and a different subpopulation of the 
      men with prostate cancer had a higher frequency of AR alleles with 12 or 13 GGCs 
      (7 of 54 men, 13%) than did the general population (1 of 110 alleles, 0.9%). Of 
      the men with prostate cancer who had an AR gene with 16 or 17 CAGs, 83% had lymph 
      node-positive disease, despite the lack of clinical evidence of metastatic 
      spread. This suggests that a short AR CAG allele may be a risk factor for the 
      development of clinically unsuspected lymph node-positive prostate cancer among 
      men undergoing radical prostatectomy and raises the question of whether this 
      short repeat length played an active role in the development of aggressive 
      prostate cancer. The odds of having a germ-line AR gene with a short CAG repeat 
      (</=17 CAGs) were substantially higher in Caucasian men with lymph node-positive 
      prostate cancer than in Caucasian men with lymph node-negative disease or in the 
      general Caucasian population. The odds of having a short germ-line AR CAG were 
      the same for men with lymph node-negative prostate cancer as for the general 
      Caucasian population. The odds of having a germ-line AR gene with a short glycine 
      repeat (</=14 GGCs) were substantially higher in men with prostate cancer than in 
      the general population, but the frequency of alleles with a short GGC repeat was 
      the same in men with lymph node-positive versus lymph node-negative disease. This 
      suggests that a short GGC repeat may be a risk factor for the development of 
      clinical prostate cancer, a hypothesis that needs to be tested in cohort and 
      case-control studies.

TI  - Caspase-3 cleaves the expanded androgen receptor protein of spinal and bulbar 
      muscular atrophy in a polyglutamine repeat length-dependent manner.
PG  - 145-50
AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is one of a group of human inherited 
      neurodegenerative diseases caused by polyglutamine expansion. There is increasing 
      evidence that generation of truncated proteins containing an expanded 
      polyglutamine tract may be an important step in the pathogenesis of these 
      disorders. We have previously demonstrated that the SBMA gene product, the 
      androgen receptor (AR) protein, is toxic when truncated. We now report that in 
      vitro translated full-length AR proteins containing different sized polyglutamine 
      repeats (24, 65 and 97 repeats, respectively) are specifically cleaved by 
      recombinant caspase-3, liberating a polyglutamine containing fragment, and that 
      the susceptibility to cleavage is polyglutamine repeat length-dependent. These 
      findings suggest that AR protein is one of the "death substrates" cleaved by 
      caspase-3 and that caspase-3 might be involved in the pathogenesis of SBMA.

TI  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA): somatic stability of an expanded CAG 
      repeat in fetal tissues.
PG  - 148-51
AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a rare X-linked motor neuron 
      degenerative disease caused by an expanded trinucleotide repeat. Unlike most 
      other trinucleotide repeat diseases, SBMA shows limited meiotic instability, and 
      evidence thus far indicates absence of somatic instability in adults. Data 
      regarding the presence of fetal tissue somatic mosaicism is unavailable. We 
      present a family in which a woman whose father had SBMA requested prenatal 
      testing. After informed consent. molecular genetic evaluation showed the male 
      fetus to carry the SBMA repeat elongation. Testing of fetal tissues after 
      elective pregnancy termination showed no somatic mosaicism in the CAG repeat 
      length. This is the first report of molecular genetic analysis of multiple 
      tissues in an affected fetus, and only the second report of prenatal diagnosis in 
      SBMA.

TI  - Evolution of the primate androgen receptor: a structural basis for disease.
PG  - 334-42
AB  - Androgen effects mediated by the androgen receptor (AR) are essential for male 
      reproductive development and virilization. Comparison of AR DNA coding sequence 
      from five primate species, Homo sapiens (human), Pan troglodytes (chimpanzee), 
      Papio hamadryas (baboon), Macaca fascicularis (macaque), and Eulemur fulvus 
      collaris (collared brown lemur), supports their phylogeny with complete 
      conservation of the DNA and steroid binding domain protein sequence. A linear 
      increase in trinucleotide repeat expansion of homologous CAG and GGC sequences 
      occurs in the NH2-terminal transcriptional activation region and is proportional 
      to the time of species divergence. A serine phosphate/glutamine repeat 
      interaction is observed where increasing CAG repeat length is associated with an 
      increased rate of serine 94 phosphorylation. Disparity in the calculated and 
      apparent molecular weight with CAG repeat expansion of an AR NH2-terminal 
      fragment suggests self-aggregation with increasing glutamine repeat length into 
      the pathological range. These results suggest that a CAG/glutamine repeat 
      expanded during divergence of the higher primate species, which may have a direct 
      effect on AR structure and support a common pathway in CAG trigenic diseases in 
      the pathophysiology of neurodegeneration observed in X-linked spinal bulbar and 
      muscular atrophy.

TI  - Clonal analysis of superficial depressed-type gastric carcinoma in humans.
PG  - 867-75
AB  - BACKGROUND: An important unanswered question concerning the histogenesis of 
      superficial-type gastric carcinoma is whether it is monoclonal or multiclonal in 
      origin. Therefore, the authors analyzed multiple areas of each cancer with a 
      clonality assay based on trinucleotide repeat length polymorphism of the human 
      androgen receptor gene (HUMARA) that was subject to random inactivation of X 
      chromosomes. METHODS: The HUMARA assay was applied to 15 gastric carcinomas, 
      early and advanced stage, manifested in superficial, depressed lesions of various 
      sizes and at least some signet ring cells. DNA was extracted from fresh frozen 
      and formalin fixed tumor tissues that were microdissected from the mucosal 
      lesions, and the HUMARA locus was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with and 
      without prior digestion of nonmethylated DNA with Hpa II. The amplified DNA 
      samples were loaded on polyacrylamide gels, electrophoresed, and visualized by a 
      silver-staining method. RESULTS: In the 15 cases examined, 9 cancers were 
      informative (had features of the types sought in this study), and in these 9 
      cancers a total of 57 areas were analyzed. In 7 of the 9 cancers, the inactivated 
      allele was common to all the informative areas of each tumor, irrespective of the 
      macroscopic shape of the tumor or the degree of histologic heterogeneity within 
      it. In one of the two remaining cancers, the inactivated allele of one of the 
      areas examined was different from those in the other areas. CONCLUSIONS: Most of 
      the superficial depressed-type gastric carcinomas in this study were demonstrated 
      to be of monoclonal origin. This finding supports a notion expressed previously 
      in the literature that superficial-type carcinoma has a long natural history, and 
      it indicates that efforts to detect gastric carcinomas in early stages to improve 
      patients' survival should be encouraged.

TI  - Clonal analysis of hematopoietic cells using a novel polymorphic site of the X 
      chromosome.
PG  - 263-6
AB  - Clonality of hematopoietic cells on a smale scale (nanogram amounts of DNA) can 
      be detected by X-chromosome inactivation using the polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR). The human androgen-receptor gene (HUMARA) has a polymorphic short tandem 
      repeat (STR), and has generally been used for clonality analysis since 
      heterozygosity for the gene occurs in 90% of caucasian females. We examined 
      heterozygosity of the STR on HUMARA in 110 Japanese females and found 
      heterozygosity in 74 of 110 (67%). To examine for hematologic clonality in 
      females with HUMARA homozygosity, we used a primer specific for a novel 
      polymorphic STR site between DXS15 and DXS134 (DXS15-134) on Xq28. Heterozygosity 
      for this site was found in 50 of 110 females (46%). Clonality of the 
      hematopoietic cells was detected in 91 of 110 females (83%) using PCR of either 
      the STR sites on HUMARA or DXS15-134. The X-inactivation patterns using PCR of 
      DXS15-134 corresponded exactly with those obtained using PCR of HUMARA in 18 
      females who were heterozygous for both DXS15-134 and HUMARA. Using PCR of 
      DXS15-134, we examined the clonality of bone marrow cells separated by flow 
      cytometry in a patient with erythroleukemia (M6). Clonality was found not only in 
      myeloid lineage cells but also in B lymphocytes. The clonality assay for 
      DXS15-134 may be useful to assess for clonality of hematopoietic cells in the 
      Japanese population, when combined with the HUMARA assay.

TI  - Androgen receptor polymorphisms (CAG repeat lengths) in androgenetic alopecia, 
      hirsutism, and acne.
PG  - 9-15
AB  - BACKGROUND: The androgen receptor (AR) is a structurally conserved member of the 
      nuclear receptor superfamily. The amino-terminal domain is required for 
      transcriptional activation and contains a region of polyglutamine encoded by CAG 
      trinucleotide repeats. In humans, the number of CAG repeats is polymorphic. 
      Expansion of CAG repeats in the AR has clinical implications for human disease. 
      OBJECTIVE: Androgens influence androgenetic alopecia (AGA), hirsutism, and acne; 
      the polymorphisms in CAG repeat length may affect the clinical course of patients 
      with these cutaneous disorders. The purpose of this study is to test for an 
      association between these disorders and CAG repeat length. METHODS: We analyzed 
      normal lymphocyte genomic DNA from a total of 48 men and 60 women. The CAG repeat 
      region of the AR was amplified by polymerase drain reaction (PCR) and the 
      products were sized on polyacrylamide gels. RESULTS: In normal men and women 
      controls, a range of 12 to 29 trinucleotide repeats was found, with men having 22 
      +/- 4 (M 6 SD), women 21 +/- 3. Men with AGA had 19 +/- 3, whereas women with AGA 
      had 17 +/- 3. Men with acne had 21 +/- 3, whereas women had 20+/- 3; men with AGA 
      and acne had 18 +/- 4; and women with hirsutism had 16 +/- 3. Women with a 
      combination of at least two disorders also had 16 +/- 3 trinucleotide repeats. 
      CONCLUSION: associated with the development of androgen-mediated skin disorders 
      in men and women. These data suggest that CAG-repeat length in AR may affect 
      androgen mediated gene expression in hair follicles and sebaceous glands in men 
      and women with these androgenic skin disorders.

TI  - Androgen receptor YAC transgenic mice carrying CAG 45 alleles show trinucleotide 
      repeat instability.
PG  - 959-67
AB  - X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is caused by a CAG repeat 
      expansion in the first exon of the androgen receptor (AR) gene. 
      Disease-associated alleles (37-66 CAGs) change in length when transmitted from 
      parents to offspring, with a significantly greater tendency to shift size when 
      inherited paternally. As transgenic mice carrying human AR cDNAs with 45 and 66 
      CAG repeats do not display repeat instability, we attempted to model 
      trinucleotide repeat instability by generating transgenic mice with yeast 
      artificial chromosomes (YACs) carrying AR CAG repeat expansions in their genomic 
      context. Studies of independent lines of AR YAC transgenic mice with CAG 45 
      alleles reveal intergenerational instability at an overall rate of approximately 
      10%. We also find that the 45 CAG repeat tracts are significantly more unstable 
      with maternal transmission and as the transmitting mother ages. Of all the 
      CAG/CTG repeat transgenic mice produced to date the AR YAC CAG 45 mice are 
      unstable with the smallest trinucleotide repeat mutations, suggesting that the 
      length threshold for repeat instability in the mouse may be lowered by including 
      the appropriate flanking human DNA sequences. By sequence-tagged site content 
      analysis and long range mapping we determined that one unstable transgenic line 
      has integrated an approximately 70 kb segment of the AR locus due to 
      fragmentation of the AR YAC. Identification of the cis -acting elements that 
      permit CAG tract instability and the trans -acting factors that modulate repeat 
      instability in the AR YAC CAG 45 mice may provide insights into the molecular 
      basis of trinucleotide repeat instability in humans.

TI  - Cleavage, aggregation and toxicity of the expanded androgen receptor in spinal 
      and bulbar muscular atrophy.
PG  - 693-701
AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a neurodegenerative disease caused 
      by the expansion of a polyglutamine repeat within the androgen receptor (AR). We 
      have studied the mutant AR in an in vitro system, and find both aggregation and 
      proteolytic processing of the AR protein to occur in a polyglutamine repeat 
      length-dependent manner. In addition, we find the aberrant metabolism of expanded 
      repeat AR to be coupled to cellular toxicity, indicating a likely molecular basis 
      for the toxic gain of AR function that produces neuronal degeneration in SBMA.

TI  - Deletion of all CGG repeats plus flanking sequences in FMR1 does not abolish gene 
      expression.
PG  - 961-7
AB  - The fragile X syndrome is due to the new class of dynamic mutations. It is 
      associated with an expansion of a trinucleotide repeat (CGG) in exon 1 of the 
      fragile X mental retardation gene 1 gene (FMR1). Here we present a fragile X 
      family with an unique female patient who was rendered hemizygous for the FRAXA 
      locus due to a large deletion of one X chromosome. In addition, the other X had a 
      microdeletion in FMR1. PCR and sequence analysis revealed that the microdeletion 
      included all CGG repeats plus 97 bp of flanking sequences, leaving transcription 
      start site and translation start site intact. Despite this total lack of CGG 
      repeats in the FMR1 gene, Western blot analysis showed expression of FMRP, and 
      the patient's phenotype was essentially normal. X-inactivation studies of the 
      androgen-receptor (AR) locus and haplotype determination of microsatellite 
      markers gave evidence that the deletion probably originated from regression of a 
      fully mutated FMR1 gene. Although the minimal number of CGG repeats hitherto 
      reported in FRAXA is six, and at least four other genes associated with CGG 
      repeats are known, suggesting an as yet unknown function of these repeats, our 
      study clearly demonstrates that the absence of CGG repeats does not abolish 
      expression of the FMR1 gene in lymphoblastoid cells.

TI  - Spinobulbar muscular atrophy can mimic ALS: the importance of genetic testing in 
      male patients with atypical ALS.
PG  - 568-72
AB  - The clinical presentation of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is variable and 
      overlaps with that of other motor neuron diseases such as spinobulbar muscular 
      atrophy (SBMA; Kennedy disease). With the identification of disease-specific 
      mutations such as the CAG repeat expansion in the androgen receptor in SBMA, an 
      accurate molecular diagnosis can be made in some patients with motor neuron 
      disease. To determine the extent of misdiagnosis of ALS we screened 147 male ALS 
      patients and 100 unrelated male patients from 100 familial ALS (FALS) kindreds 
      for the presence of the SBMA mutation using polymerase chain reaction methods. We 
      show that ALS was clinically misdiagnosed in 2% of sporadic cases and in two of 
      the 100 FALS kindreds. This study underscores the difficulty in distinguishing 
      SBMA from ALS clinically, particularly in patients who lack the classic signs of 
      each disease.

TI  - Evidence for monoclonal expansion of epithelial cells in ovarian endometrial 
      cysts.
PG  - 1173-8
AB  - Ovarian endometrial cysts, one of the typical manifestations of endometriosis, 
      are generated by the retention of cyclic hemorrhages and are classified as 
      tumor-like lesions rather than neoplasms. Clonality analysis provides important 
      information about the histogenesis and progression of neoplastic diseases. As it 
      is generally accepted that most neoplasms are monoclonal in origin, however, the 
      clonality of endometrial cysts remains uncertain. Using the human androgen 
      receptor gene (HUMARA) as an X-linked polymorphic marker, we examined the clonal 
      status of epithelial cells in endometrial cysts. We separated 21 fresh epithelial 
      cell samples from 11 endometrial cysts and found that all were monoclonal in the 
      methylation pattern of the HUMARA alleles. Moreover, in each of the five cysts 
      from which epithelial cells were sampled from multiple and distant areas, the 
      methylation patterns of all samples from a single cyst were identical. These data 
      indicate that endometrial cysts are monoclonal in origin and suggest their 
      neoplastic potentiality.

TI  - Instability of highly expanded CAG repeats in mice transgenic for the 
      Huntington's disease mutation.
PG  - 197-200
AB  - Six inherited neurodegenerative diseases are caused by a CAG/polyglutamine 
      expansion, including spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), Huntington's 
      disease (HD), spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), dentatorubral pallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA) Machado-Joseph disease (MJD or SCA3) and SCA2. Normal and 
      expanded HD allele sizes of 6-39 and 35-121 repeats have been reported, and the 
      allele distributions for the other diseases are comparable. Intergenerational 
      instability has been described in all cases, and repeats tend to be more unstable 
      on paternal transmission. This may present as larger increases on paternal 
      inheritance as in HD, or as a tendency to increase on male and decrease on female 
      transmission as in SCA1 (ref. 15). Somatic repeat instability is also apparent 
      and appears most pronounced in the CNS. The major exception is the cerebellum, 
      which in HD, DRPLA, SCA1 and MJD has a smaller repeat relative to the other brain 
      regions tested. Of non-CNS tissues, instability was observed in blood, liver, 
      kidney and colon. A mouse model of CAG repeat instability would be helpful in 
      unravelling its molecular basis although an absence of CAG repeat instability in 
      transgenic mice has so far been reported. These studies include (CAG) in the 
      androgen receptor cDNA, (CAG) in the HD cDNA, (CAG) in the SCA1 cDNA, (CAG) in 
      the SCA3 cDNA and as an isolated (CAG) tract.

TI  - UKPDS 19: heterogeneity in NIDDM: separate contributions of IRS-1 and beta 
      3-adrenergic-receptor mutations to insulin resistance and obesity respectively 
      with no evidence for glycogen synthase gene mutations. UK Prospective Diabetes 
      Study.
PG  - 1505-11
AB  - Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), beta 3-adrenergic-receptor (beta 3-AR) and 
      glycogen synthase (GS) genes are candidate genes for non-insulin-dependent 
      diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia and obesity. We 
      studied white Caucasian subjects with NIDDM, 227 being randomly selected, 49 
      NIDDM within the top two percentiles of insulin resistance; 54 with dyslipidaemia 
      in the top quintile of triglyceride/insulin and the bottom quintile of HDL, and 
      166 non-diabetic control subjects. We examined the association of the simple 
      tandem repeat DNA polymorphisms (STRPs) near the IRS-1 and GS genes, and the 
      prevalence of mutations at codons of IRS-1 513 and 972, beta 3-AR 64 and GS 464 
      using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). The STRP alleles in IRS-1 
      were significantly different between NIDDM and control subjects (p = 0.015). The 
      IRS-1 972 mutation was significantly different between the four groups with 
      increased prevalence in the insulin resistant and dyslipidaemia subjects (18 and 
      26% compared with 11% in control subjects; p < 0.0005). Those with or without 
      IRS-1 mutations had similar clinical characteristics and impaired insulin 
      sensitivity. beta 3-AR 64 mutation was not significantly different between the 
      four groups but those with the mutation were more obese, with a test for linear 
      association between number of alleles and degree of obesity in an analysis of 
      variance showing a significant association (p = 0.029). The GS 464 mutation was 
      not detected in any of the diabetic or control subjects and the population 
      association study using GS STRP showed no difference in allelic frequencies 
      between NIDDM patients and control subjects. A mutation in lipoprotein lipase at 
      codon 291, associated in the general population with low HDL cholesterol, was not 
      at increased prevalence in the NIDDM patients with dyslipidaemia. In conclusion, 
      IRS-1 972 had an increased prevalence in subjects with insulin resistance, with 
      or without dyslipidaemia. beta 3-AR 64 was associated with increased obesity but 
      not with insulin resistance or dyslipidaemia. These separate contributions to 
      different features of NIDDM are an example of the polygenic inheritance of this 
      heterogeneous disorder.

TI  - Androgen receptor CAG repeat lengths in prostate cancer: correlation with age of 
      onset.
PG  - 4400-5
AB  - The androgen receptor (AR) is a structurally conserved member of the nuclear 
      receptor superfamily. The amino-terminal domain is required for transcriptional 
      activation and contains a region of polyglutamine encoded by CAG trinucleotide 
      repeats. In humans, the number of CAG repeats is polymorphic; the average number 
      is 22 in Caucasian males. Expansion of CAG repeats in the AR has clinical 
      implications for human disease. As androgen influences prostate cancer growth, 
      polymorphisms in CAG repeat length may affect the clinical course of patients 
      with prostate cancer. To test for an association between clinical parameters of 
      human prostate cancer and CAG repeat length, we analyzed normal lymphocyte DNA 
      from 109 patients. The CAG region of the AR was amplified by the PCR. Reaction 
      products were then amplified using end-labeled internal primers, cut at the 
      internal PstI site and assayed on sequencing gels using a sequence ladder as a 
      size standard. Sequence analysis of several samples validated this method for 
      measurement of CAG repeat number. The median age of patients was 63 yr (range, 
      42-83), with 104 Caucasian, 2 African American, 1 Asian, and 2 other racial 
      origin. The median repeat length was 25 for patients with stage A, 22 for 
      patients with stage B, 22 for patients with stage C, and 23 for patients 
      presenting with stage D disease. A significant correlation between CAG repeat 
      length and age at onset was observed, whereas correlations with stage, level of 
      prostate-specific antigen at diagnosis, and time to prostate-specific antigen 
      relapse were not significant. Shorter CAG repeat lengths may be associated with 
      the development of prostate cancer in men at a younger age. These data suggest 
      that CAG repeat length can affect the risk of developing prostate cancer.

TI  - Demonstration of an osteoblast defect in two cases of human malignant 
      osteopetrosis. Correction of the phenotype after bone marrow transplant.
PG  - 1835-42
AB  - Osteopetrosis is an inherited disorder characterized by bone sclerosis due to 
      reduced bone resorption. Here we report that human osteopetrotic osteoblast-like 
      (Ob) cells express a defective phenotype in primary cultures in vitro, and that 
      bone marrow transplant (BMT) corrects osteoblast function. DNA analysis at 
      polymorphic short-tandem repeat loci from donor, recipient, and primary Ob-like 
      cells pre-BMT and 2 yr post-BMT revealed that Ob were still of recipient origin 
      post-BMT. Osteopetrotic Ob-like cells obtained pre-BMT showed normal and abnormal 
      1,25(OH)2D3-induced alkaline phosphatase (ALPase) and osteocalcin production, 
      respectively, and failed to produce macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) 
      in response to IL-1a and TNF-alpha. These parameters were all normalized in 
      primary Ob-like cells prepared 2 yr post-BMT. X-linked clonality analysis at the 
      human androgen receptor (HUMARA) locus revealed that osteoblasts showed a 
      polyclonal and an oligoclonal derivation pre- and post-BMT respectively, 
      indicating that a limited number of progenitor reconstituted this population. 
      Because osteoblasts were still of recipient origin post-BMT, this suggests that 
      functional osteoclasts, due to the replacement of hematopoeitic cells, provided a 
      local microenvironment in vivo triggering the differentiation and/or recruitment 
      of a limited number of functional osteoblasts.

TI  - CAG-repeat expansion in androgen receptor in Kennedy's disease is not a loss of 
      function mutation.
PG  - 149-56
AB  - Expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeats in androgen receptor gene is present in 
      patients with a rare X-linked inherited form of motor neuron disorder termed 
      Kennedy's disease or spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). This is a late 
      onset progressive disease often associated with mild signs of androgen 
      insensitivity. Defects in androgen receptor (AR) action have been linked to the 
      expansion of the CAG trinucleotide repeats and postulated to be the cause of the 
      disease. We have identified a trinucleotide repeat of 45 in the N-terminus of the 
      AR in two brothers with SBMA and several members in their family (range in the 
      general population is 11-35). Treatment of the patients with androgens failed to 
      improve their clinical symptoms and provided no hint of an anomalous function of 
      the AR. Consistently, functional analysis of the mutant receptor showed hormone 
      binding, transactivation and transrepression potentials identical to that of the 
      wild-type receptor. These results together argue against SBMA being a loss of 
      function mutation of the AR.

TI  - Differential pattern in tissue-specific somatic mosaicism of expanded CAG 
      trinucleotide repeats in dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, Machado-Joseph 
      disease, and X-linked recessive spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.
PG  - 43-50
AB  - We investigated the somatic mosaicism of trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 
      neural and nonneural tissues of a dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) 
      patient and their correlation to the topographical distribution of the 
      pathological involvement. The spatial pattern of tissue-specific somatic 
      mosaicism in the CAG repeat size was significantly different among the DRPLA, MJD 
      and SBMA patients. The size of the major bands of the mutant CAG repeat allele 
      was significantly smaller in the cerebellar cortex in both DRPLA and MJD patients 
      by 6 and 2 repeat units respectively and larger in the colon and liver of DRPLA 
      by 5 repeats or more. There were also 1-2 repeat-sized small variations of major 
      band size among the neural tissues in DRPLA. In contrast, there was no 
      tissue-specific variation of major bands of CAG repeats and diversity of extra 
      bands among the examined tissues including the cerebellum in the SBMA patient. 
      There was no parallel occurrence of tissue-specific CAG instability and severity 
      of neuropathological involvement in the neural and nonneural tissues of DRPLA, 
      MJD and SBMA patients. Lack of significant tissue-specific somatic mosaicism in 
      SBMA including the cerebellar cortex may suggest that CAG repeat expansion in the 
      mutant androgen receptor gene is far more stable compared with that in DRPLA and 
      MJD as well as those reported in Huntington's disease.

TI  - Somatic stability of the expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat in X-linked spinal and

PG  - 32-7
AB  - Expansion of trinucleotide repeats has now been associated with eight inherited 
      diseases: X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, two fragile X syndromes, 
      myotonic dystrophy, Huntington's disease, spinocerebellar ataxia type I, 
      dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy and Machado-Joseph disease. It has been 
      shown that these expanded DNA repeats are unstable in number when transmitted 
      from parents to offspring ("meiotic instability"), while somatic variation in 
      repeat number has also been found in the fragile X syndrome and myotonic 
      dystrophy. Moderate meiotic instability has been demonstrated in X-linked spinal 
      and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA, Kennedy's disease). In order to determine if 
      the expanded CAG repeat in SBMA also shows somatic instability, we compared 
      different tissues from two patients with SBMA. We then examined the in vitro 
      stability of the CAG repeat expansion by analyzing fibroblast cell cultures. 
      Length comparison of expanded CAG repeats from all these materials clearly 
      demonstrates that the CAG trinucleotide repeat in SBMA does not exhibit somatic 
      variation.

TI  - Prevalence, genetics and clinical presentation of chronic granulomatous disease 
      in Sweden.
PG  - 1386-94
AB  - To estimate the prevalence of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) in Sweden, an 
      inquiry asking for known and possible CGD cases was mailed to paediatric, 
      internal medicine and infectious disease departments all over Sweden. The 
      detected patients were characterized as to genetics and the clinical 
      presentation. Twenty-one patients (belonging to 16 different families) were 
      found, corresponding to a prevalence of approximately 1/450,000 individuals. The 
      patients with X-linked disease, lacking a functional gp91phox protein (n = 12), 
      comprised 57% and 43% of the patients had an autosomal recessive (AR) disease 
      lacking p47phox (n = 7) or p67phox (n = 1), respectively. All unrelated patients 
      with X-linked disease displayed different gene abnormalities such as point 
      mutations predicting nonsense (n = 3), missense (n = 1) or splice site mutations 
      (n = 2), but also a total deletion and a unique 40 base pair duplicature 
      insertion. The patients with p47phox-deficiency showed a GT deletion at a GTGT 
      tandem repeat, and the p67phox-deficient patient displayed a heterozygous 
      in-frame deletion of AAG combined with a large deletion in the other allele. 
      Three patients died during the study period, two from pseudomonas cepacia 
      infections. Patients with X-linked disease had more frequent infections (mean of 
      1.7 per year), than the patients with AR inheritance (0.5 infections per year). 
      The most common infections were dermal abscesses (n = 111), followed by 
      lymphadenitis (n = 82) and pneumonias (n = 73). Inflammatory bowel disease-like 
      symptoms, mimicking Crohn's disease of the colon, was seen in three CGD patients.

TI  - Clonal analysis of peripheral blood and haemopoietic colonies in patients with 
      aplastic anaemia and refractory anaemia using the polymorphic short tandem repeat 
      on the human androgen-receptor (HUMARA) gene.
PG  - 838-44
AB  - The clonalities in white blood cells (WBC) of blood and nucleated bone marrow 
      cells from patients with refractory anaemia and aplastic anaemia were examined by 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods using the polymorphic short tandem repeat 
      (STR) on the human androgen-receptor gene (HUMARA). Peripheral blood samples were 
      obtained from 12 female patients, six with aplastic anaemia (AA) and six with 
      refractory anaemia (RA). Peripheral blood was fractionated into granulocytes, 
      lymphocytes, T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes. DNA was extracted from each 
      fraction. Bone marrow samples were obtained from seven female patients (three 
      with AA and four with RA). Sorted CD34 positive cells were cultured in a 
      semisolid culture system. DNA was extracted from a 14-day haemopoietic colony. 
      The clonal pattern was assessed using HUMARA gene STR polymorphism and the 
      differential methylation pattern of nearby cytosine residues by PCR methods. Four 
      of six (67%) AA and two of six (33%) RA patients had a monoclonal proliferating 
      pattern in their granulocytes. The ratio of the numbers of minority colonies per 
      majority colonies (m/M ratio) was examined for seven patients (three AA and four 
      RA). In patients who had a clonal haemopoietic pattern in peripheral WBC the 
      ratio was under 0.4 but not zero. In contrast, patients exhibiting a polyclonal 
      pattern had an m/M ratio above 0.8. We concluded that some normal or heterogenous 
      haemopoietic clones, not only MDS but also AA, may remain in the bone marrow, 
      although almost all colonies were derived from a single pathogenic clone when the 
      clonality pattern exhibited monoclonality in peripheral blood analysis.

TI  - CAG repeat length variation in sperm from a patient with Kennedy's disease.
PG  - 303-5
AB  - Using a modified sperm typing protocol, the mutation frequency of the CAG repeat 
      region at the androgen receptor locus has been measured using a rare semen sample 
      from an individual with spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). Among 258 X 
      chromosome-containing sperm, 19% had a repeat number equal to the donor's somatic 
      DNA (47 repeats), 66% were expansions and 15% were contractions. The average 
      expansion was 2.7 repeats. More than half of the expansions involved one or two 
      repeats; the largest was 11 repeats. 68% of the contractions were also one or two 
      repeats but six (16%) were very large (12-25 repeats). One contraction generated 
      an allele in an intermediate size range (33-39 repeats). Such alleles have not 
      been observed among more than 900 normal and SBMA X-chromosomes that have been 
      examined. Comparison of the SBMA sperm typing results with mutation frequency 
      data on normal alleles supports the hypothesis that trinucleotide repeat 
      expansions may have a different molecular origin than contractions.

PG  - 191-6
AB  - The expansion of trinucleotide repeat sequences underlies a number of hereditary 
      neurological disorders. To study the stability of a trinucleotide repeat and to 
      develop an animal model of one of these disorders, spinal and bulbar muscular 
      atrophy (SBMA), we have generated transgenic mice carrying either the normal or 
      expanded repeat human androgen receptor (AR) gene. Unlike the disease allele in 
      humans, the AR cDNA containing the expanded repeat in transgenic mice showed no 
      change in repeat length with transmission. Expression of the SBMA AR was found in 
      transgenic mice, but at a lower level than normal endogenous expression. The lack 
      of a physiological pattern of expression may explain why no phenotypic effects of 
      the transgene were observed.

TI  - The length and location of CAG trinucleotide repeats in the androgen receptor 
      N-terminal domain affect transactivation function.
PG  - 3181-6
AB  - Some transcription factors contain stretches of polyglutamine encoded by repeats 
      of the trinucleotide CAG. Expansion of the CAG repeat in the androgen receptor 
      (AR) has been correlated with the incidence and severity of X-linked spinal and 
      bulbar muscular atrophy (Kennedy's disease). In order to understand the 
      relationship of this mutation to AR function, we constructed ARs that varied in 
      the position and size of the polyglutamine tract, and assayed for the abilities 
      of these mutant receptors to bind androgen and to activate transcription of 
      several different AR-responsive reporter genes. Elimination of the tract in both 
      human and rat AR resulted in elevated transcriptional activation activity, 
      strongly suggesting that the presence of the polyglutamine tract is inhibitory to 
      transactivation. Progressive expansion of the CAG repeat in human AR caused a 
      linear decrease of transactivation function. Importantly, expansion of the tract 
      did not completely eliminate AR activity. We postulate that this residual AR 
      activity may be sufficient for development of male primary and secondary sex 
      characteristics, but may fall below a threshold level of activity necessary for 
      normal maintenance of motor neuron function. This functional abnormality may be 
      representative of other genetic diseases that are associated with CAG expansion 
      mutations in open reading frames, such as spinocerebellar ataxia type I and 
      Huntington's disease.

PG  - 531-5
AB  - Trinucleotide repeat mutations of normal alleles at the human androgen receptor 
      locus were studied by typing approximately 4,300 sperm. Control experiments 
      established that the mutation events were of germline origin. The mutation rate 
      for 20-22 repeat alleles was similar to that shown by family analysis. Alleles 
      with 28-31 repeats had a 4.4 times greater rate of mutation with contractions 
      outnumbering expansions. Preliminary experiments on the trinucleotide repeat 
      associated with myotonic dystrophy gave similar results although in one donor 
      expansions were six times greater than contractions. Comparison of the sperm data 
      to mutations of disease alleles in SBMA families suggests that expansions may 
      have a different origin than contractions.

TI  - Exonic trinucleotide repeats and expression of androgen receptor gene in spinal 
      cord from X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.
PG  - 74-9
AB  - We studied exonic trinucleotide repeats and expression of androgen receptor (AR) 
      gene in the spinal cord from an autopsied patient with X-linked spinal and bulbar 
      muscular atrophy (SBMA). Forty-nine CAG triplet repeats were found in tissues 
      from the spinal cord, cerebrum, cerebellum, cardiac muscle and bladder, while 
      there were 20-24 CAG repeats in these tissues from control subjects, consisting 
      of three patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and three patients 
      with lung cancer. Thus, mitotic instability of the AR gene in SBMA may not occur 
      at the level of somatic cells. To determine whether expression of the AR gene in 
      the spinal cord of SBMA differs from that in control subjects, we used 
      quantitative reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and Western blot. AR mRNA and protein 
      were detected in the spinal cord from the patient with SBMA, but the levels of 
      both AR mRNA and protein were less than those from the patients with ALS in whom 
      the loss of motor neurons was similar to findings in the patient with SBMA. These 
      findings suggest that structural alteration plus a reduced level of AR in the 
      spinal cord are involved in the pathogenesis of SBMA, resulting in degeneration 
      of motor neurons.

TI  - Fluorescent approaches to diagnosis of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and quantitative 
      analysis of carrier status.
PG  - 311-24
AB  - Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by molecular 
      defects within the HPRT gene. Deletional forms of this syndrome, most of which 
      are inherited, account for 15% of the cases. In addition, a large percentage of 
      cases are due to de novo point mutations. We have used complementary 
      fluorescence-based PCR assays to analyse disease-causing mutations in three 
      unrelated families: (1) inheritance of dye-labelled PCR products of linked 
      polymorphic loci mapping within and flanking the HPRT gene; (2) dye-labelled exon 
      dosage analysis and (3) automated fluorescence-based DNA sequence analysis. Our 
      results using fluorescent, dye-tagged PCR products show that inheritance of two 
      polymorphic small tandem repeats, HPRTB [AGAT]n, mapping within intron 3 of the 
      HPRT gene, and the CA-repeat at DXS294 can be used to establish linkage to the 
      disease. In addition, we modified a previously described PCR protocol to use 
      fluorescent dye-labelled oligoprimers and an ABI Gene Scanner in order to rapidly 
      quantitate deletional forms of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Quantitative PCR analysis of 
      individual exons followed by dosage analysis confirmed a deletion encompassing 
      exon 9. A similar approach was used to confirm a previously described HPRT gene 
      duplication involving exons 2 and 3. In this analysis, we co-amplified the HPRTB 
      [AGAT]n and HUMARA [AGC]n repeats and confirmed increased exon dosage in carriers 
      for the duplication. DNA sequence analysis remains the method of choice for 
      delineating new disease-causing mutations, most of which are non-deletional forms 
      of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. We have also used a cycle-sequencing strategy employing 
      dye-labelled dideoxy terminators and a laser-activated, fluorescence-emission DNA 
      sequencer in order to define carrier status in 10 family members at risk for 
      Lesch-Nyhan syndrome due to a splice donor mutation in intron 7. Our DNA sequence 
      analyses corroborate small tandem repeat (STR) inheritance patterns in this 
      family. Multiple fluorescence-based strategies should facilitate rapid diagnosis 
      of the various Lesch-Nyhan disease-causing mutations.

TI  - Strong correlation between the number of CAG repeats in androgen receptor genes 
      and the clinical onset of features of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.
PG  - 2300-2
AB  - X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), a motor neuron disease 
      associated with androgen insensitivity, is caused by androgen receptor gene 
      mutations with an increased number of tandem CAG repeats in exon 1. We 
      investigated the increased number of CAG repeats in androgen receptor genes of 19 
      SBMA patients and found that this correlated strongly with the age at onset of 
      muscle weakness. Thus, SBMA is the first genetic disease in which a strong 
      correlation between the degree of genetic abnormality (number of CAG tandem 
      repeats) and clinical phenotypic expression is demonstrable. The results further 
      indicate that androgen gene mutation is directly involved in the degeneration of 
      motor neurons.

TI  - A novel primer extension method to detect the number of CAG repeats in the 
      androgen receptor gene in families with X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular 
      atrophy.
PG  - 507-13
AB  - X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), an adult-onset form of motor 
      neuron disease, was recently reported to be caused by amplification of the CAG 
      repeats in the androgen receptor gene. We report here a simple and rapid strategy 
      to detect the precise number of the CAGs. After the DNA fragment containing the 
      CAG repeats is amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, a primer extension is 
      carried out; the extension of the end-labelled reverse primer adjacent to 3' end 
      of CAG repeats stops at the first T after CAG repeats with the incorporation of 
      dideoxy ATP in the reaction mixture. The resultant primer products are analysed 
      by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. This method 
      could be quite useful to detect not only CAG repeats in SBMA but also other 
      polymorphic dinucleotide and trinucleotide repeats.
