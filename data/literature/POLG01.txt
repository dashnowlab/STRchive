AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate our experience in the diagnosis of 
      hereditary ataxias (HAs), to analyze data from a real-world scenario. STUDY 
      DESIGN: This is a retrospective, cross-sectional, descriptive study conducted at 
      a single Italian adult neurogenetic outpatient clinic, in 147 patients affected 
      by ataxia with a suspicion of hereditary forms, recruited from November 1999 to 
      February 2024. A stepwise approach for molecular diagnostics was applied: 
      targeted gene panel (TP) next-generation sequencing (NGS) and/or clinical exome 
      sequencing (CES) were performed in the case of inconclusive first-line genetic 
      testing, such as short tandem repeat expansions (TREs) testing for most common 
      spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA1-3, 6-8,12,17, DRPLA), other forms [Fragile 
      X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) and 
      mitochondrial DNA-related ataxia, RFC1-related ataxia/CANVAS] or inconclusive 
      phenotype-guided specific single gene sequencing. RESULT: A definitive diagnosis 
      was reached in 36.7% of the cases. TREs testing was diagnostic in 30.4% of 
      patients. The three most common TREs ataxias were FRDA (36.1%), SCA2 (27.8%), and 
      RFC1-related ataxia/CANVAS (11.1%). In five patients, the molecular diagnosis was 
      achieved by single gene sequencing and causative mutations were identified in 
      POLG (2), SACS (1), DARS2 (1), MT-ATP6 (1). Of 94 patients with a suspicion of 
      HAs of indeterminate genetic origin, 68 underwent new molecular evaluation using 
      the NGS approach. In 28 of these cases, CES was performed after the TP sequencing 
      resulted negative. In 13 patients, the diagnosis was achieved by NGS approach. In 
      7 of these 13 patients, the diagnosis was made by CES. Genes mutations identified 
      as causative of HAs were found in SPG7 (4), SACS (1), CACNA1A (1), CACNA1G (1), 
      EEF2 (1), PRKCG (1), KCNC3 (1), ADCK3 (1), SYNE1 (1), ITPR1 (1). A positive 
      family history of ataxia and early onset of symptoms were associated with a 
      higher likelihood of obtaining a definite diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The molecular 
      diagnosis of HAs remains a significant challenge for neurologists. Our data 
      indicate that, in most cases, a diagnosis of HA can be established through first 
      line genetic testing, particularly TREs testing. However, for patients with a 
      clinical diagnosis of HA who do not achieve a molecular diagnosis through initial 
      genetic tests, the use of NGS proves to be a valuable tool, providing a 
      definitive diagnosis in approximately 20% of cases. Therefore, when feasible in 
      clinical practice, integrating NGS testing, especially exome sequencing, into the 
      diagnostic decision-making process for unsolved cases is crucial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The genetics of cerebellar ataxia is complex. Hundreds of causative 
      genes have been identified, but only a few cause more than single cases. The 
      spectrum of ataxia-causing genes differs considerably between populations. The 
      aim of the study was to investigate the molecular epidemiology of ataxia in the 
      Finnish population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients in hospital database were 
      reviewed for the diagnosis of unspecified ataxia. Acquired ataxias and nongenetic 
      ataxias such as those related to infection, trauma or stroke were excluded. Sixty 
      patients with sporadic ataxia with unknown etiology and 36 patients with familial 
      ataxia of unknown etiology were recruited in the study. Repeat expansions in the 
      SCA genes (ATXN1, 2, 3, 7, 8/OS, CACNA1A, TBP), FXN, and RFC1 were determined. 
      Point mutations in POLG, SPG7 and in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were investigated. 
      In addition, DNA from 8 patients was exome sequenced. RESULTS: A genetic cause of 
      ataxia was found in 33 patients (34.4%). Seven patients had a dominantly 
      inherited repeat expansion in ATXN8/OS. Ten patients had mitochondrial ataxia 
      resulting from mutations in nuclear mitochondrial genes POLG or RARS2, or from a 
      point mutation m.8561C > G or a single deletion in mtDNA. Interestingly, five 
      patients were biallelic for the recently identified pathogenic repeat expansion 
      in RFC1. All the five patients presented with the phenotype of cerebellar ataxia, 
      neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia (CANVAS). Moreover, screening of 54 patients 
      with Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy revealed four additional patients with 
      biallelic repeat expansion in RFC1, but none of them had cerebellar symptoms. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Expansion in ATXN8/OS results in the majority of dominant ataxias in 
      Finland, while mutations in RFC1 and POLG are the most common cause of recessive 
      ataxias. Our results suggest that analysis of RFC1 should be included in the 
      routine diagnostics of idiopathic ataxia and Charcot-Marie-Tooth polyneuropathy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Variation contributing to the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) has 
      been identified in several genes and at several loci including GBA, SMPD1, LRRK2, 
      POLG1, CHCHD10 and MAPT, but the frequencies of risk variants seem to vary 
      according to ethnic background. Our aim was to analyze how variation in these 
      genes contributes to PD in the Finnish population. METHODS: The subjects 
      consisted of 527 Finnish patients with early-onset PD, 325 patients with 
      late-onset PD and 403 population controls. We screened for known genetic risk 
      variants in GBA, SMPD1, LRRK2, POLG1, CHCHD10 and MAPT. In addition, DNA from 225 
      patients with early-onset Parkinson's disease was subjected to whole exome 
      sequencing (WES). RESULTS: We detected a significant difference in the length 
      variation of the CAG repeat in POLG1 between patients with early-onset PD 
      compared to controls. The p.N370S and p.L444P variants in GBA contributed to a 
      relative risk of 3.8 in early-onset PD and 2.5 in late-onset PD. WES revealed 
      five variants in LRRK2 and SMPD1 that were found in the patients but not in the 
      Finnish ExAC sequences. These are possible risk variants that require further 
      confirmation. The p.G2019S variant in LRRK2, common in North African Arabs and 
      Ashkenazi Jews, was not detected in any of the 849 PD patients. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      POLG1 CAG repeat length variation and the GBA p.L444P variant are associated with 
      PD in the Finnish population.

TI  - A panel study on patients with dominant cerebellar ataxia highlights the 
      frequency of channelopathies.
PG  - 1579-1594

AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias have a marked heterogeneous genetic 
      background, with mutations in 34 genes identified so far. This large amount of 
      implicated genes accounts for heterogeneous clinical presentations, making 
      genotype-phenotype correlations a major challenge in the field. While 
      polyglutamine ataxias, linked to CAG repeat expansions in genes such as ATXN1, 
      ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, CACNA1A and TBP, have been extensively characterized in 
      large cohorts, there is a need for comprehensive assessment of frequency and 
      phenotype of more 'conventional' ataxias. After exclusion of CAG/polyglutamine 
      expansions in spinocerebellar ataxia genes in 412 index cases with dominantly 
      inherited cerebellar ataxias, we aimed to establish the relative frequencies of 
      mutations in other genes, with an approach combining panel sequencing and TaqMan(R) 
      polymerase chain reaction assay. We found relevant genetic variants in 59 
      patients (14.3%). The most frequently mutated were channel genes [CACNA1A (n = 
      16), KCND3 (n = 4), KCNC3 (n = 2) and KCNA1 (n = 2)]. Deletions in ITPR1 (n = 11) 
      were followed by biallelic variants in SPG7 (n = 9). Variants in AFG3L2 (n = 7) 
      came next in frequency, and variants were rarely found in STBN2 (n = 2), ELOVL5, 
      FGF14, STUB1 and TTBK2 (n = 1 each). Interestingly, possible risk factor variants 
      were detected in SPG7 and POLG. Clinical comparisons showed that ataxias due to 
      channelopathies had a significantly earlier age at onset with an average of 24.6 
      years, versus 40.9 years for polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias and 
      37.8 years for SPG7-related forms (P = 0.001). In contrast, disease duration was 
      significantly longer in the former (20.5 years versus 9.3 and 13.7, P=0.001), 
      though for similar functional stages, indicating slower progression of the 
      disease. Of interest, intellectual deficiency was more frequent in channel 
      spinocerebellar ataxias, while cognitive impairment in adulthood was similar 
      among the three groups. Similar differences were found among a single gene group, 
      comparing 23 patients with CACNA1A expansions (spinocerebellar ataxia 6) to 22 
      patients with CACNA1A point mutations, which had lower average age at onset (25.2 
      versus 47.3 years) with longer disease duration (18.7 versus 10.9), but lower 
      severity indexes (0.39 versus 0.44), indicating slower progression of the 
      disease. In conclusion, we identified relevant genetic variations in up to 15% of 
      cases after exclusion of polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias, and 
      confirmed CACNA1A and SPG7 as major ataxia genes. We could delineate firm 
      genotype-phenotype correlations that are important for genetic counselling and of 
      possible prognostic value.

TI  - The POLG Polyglutamine Tract Variants in Iranian Patients with Multiple 
      Sclerosis.
PG  - 37-41
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a common disease of the central nervous 
      system. The interaction between inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes 
      typically results in irregular neurological disturbances followed by progressive 
      disability. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in neurodegenerative 
      disorders. The DNA polymerase-gamma (POLG) gene, which encodes the catalytic 
      subunit of enzyme responsible for directing mtDNA replication, contains a poly 
      glutamine tract (poly-Q) in the N-terminal, encoded by a CAG sequence in exon 2. 
      MATERIALS & METHODS: We analyzed the POLG trinucleotide repeats in 40 Iranian 
      patients with MS (27 females and 13 males with an age range of 18-55); and 47 
      healthy age, gender, and ethnic matched controls were chosen by PCR-SSCP 
      analysis. RESULTS: Our results indicated that the most common allele in patients 
      had 10 consecutive CAG repeats (10Q). Other alleles of 11and 12 trinucleotide 
      repeats were detected. We did not find any difference between the CAG repeat 
      length distribution in controls and MS patients. CONCLUSION: No correlation was 
      observed in the POLG gene CAG repeat with pathogenesis of MS, but it looks that 
      other point mutations in POLG gene may have an important role in the disease's 
      pathogenesis and produced more significant results.

AB  - A recent meta-analysis suggested that rare CAG repeat variants in the gene that 
      encodes polymerase gamma (POLG1) predispose individuals to develop Parkinson's 
      disease (PD); alternative alleles were proposed to increase risk by 27%. In the 
      current case-control study of 2255 Australians, we observed no statistical 
      association between individuals possessing rare CAG repeat genotypes and PD 
      (p=0.178); a subsequent meta-analysis of 2852 PD cases and 2833 controls was also 
      non-significant (OR=1.085, p=0.124). Moreover, mitochondrial DNA synthesis 
      (p=0.427) or Complex I activity (p=0.639) were not different in cells derived 
      from individuals with different POLG1 genotypes. These data provide no evidence 
      to suggest CAG repeat length in POLG1 affects PD susceptibility.

TI  - Mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma gene polymorphism is not associated with male 
      infertility.
PG  - 1109-14
LID - 10.1007/s10815-013-0058-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: CAG repeat length of human miotochondrial DNA Polymerase gamma (POLG) 
      gene is polymorphic with a major allele at 10 repeats and considered as the 
      common allele whereas the mutant alleles (not 10/not 10 CAG repeats) were found 
      to be associated with oligospermia / oligoasthenospermia in male infertility. To 
      explore whether CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in exon 1 of POLG gene is 
      associated with spermatogenic failure. METHODS: One hundred twenty four infertile 
      men (sperm count <20 million/ml) and 60 normozoospermic (sperm count 
      >20 million/ml) control Indian men of Tamil Nadu, were enrolled. DNA was 
      extracted from 10 ml of peripheral blood and from semen using standard 
      procedures. CAG repeat expansion was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction. 
      Amplified products were quantified by 2 % agarose gel electrophoresis and 
      subjected to genescan analysis to ascertain the size of POLG-CAG alleles. 
      RESULTS: This analysis interestingly revealed that the common allele 10 (10-CAG 
      repeats) was widespread in infertile and normozoospermic control men with a 
      frequency of 79 % and 71.7 % respectively. No statistical significance was found 
      in POLG genotypic frequency distribution between infertile men and normospermic 
      men. CONCLUSION: The present study confirmed no association between the POLG gene 
      polymorphism and male infertility. Thus, if associated with infertility, the POLG 
      gene polymorphism should be only considered as a minor possible contributing 
      factor in infertile male patients with no impact on obtaining a pregnancy.

TI  - The POLG Gene Polymorphism in Iranian Varicocele-Associated Infertility Patients.
PG  - 739-44
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Varicocele is associated with impaired testicular function and male 
      infertility, but the molecular mechanisms by which fertility is affected have not 
      been satisfactorily explained. The aim of our study was to investigate whether or 
      not the polymerase gamma (POLG) polymorphism is associated with Iranian 
      varicocele patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We determined the POLG CAG repeat 
      length in DNA samples extracted from 40 varicocele patients and 30 control 
      subjects by PCR-denature polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and sequencing. 
      RESULTS: The distribution of the CAG repeat length in varicocele patients showed 
      no notable difference from that in control subjects, but we found a significant 
      statistical inverse correlation between 10/10 and 10/#10 genotypes and varicocele 
      grade. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that POLG CAG repeats may affects the 
      varicocele grade, but the mechanisms remain to be elucidated.

AB  - The number of CAG repeats in the mitochondrial DNA-polymerase gamma (POLG1) gene 
      has been associated with Parkinson disease (PD) in some populations. We sequenced 
      the CAG tract of POLG1 in 191 Norwegian patients with PD and an equal number of 
      controls and found an association between non-10 or 11 CAG repeats and PD in our 
      population. While our results were significant, this trend was not maintained 
      following correction for multiple testing. We also performed a meta-analysis of 
      all published studies including our own that shows PD is associated with the 
      number of CAG repeats in POLG1. The meta-analysis reveals that the rare allelic 
      variation encompassed by non-10 CAG repeats associates significantly with PD 
      (p=0.0017). Whether this reflects a direct influence of POLG on the pathogenesis 
      of PD or linkage disequilibrium between POLG1 alleles and nearby, 
      disease-influencing genetic variants remains unknown.

TI  - POLG, but not PEO1, is a frequent cause of cerebellar ataxia in Central Europe.
PG  - 2678-82
LID - 10.1002/mds.23286 [doi]
AB  - Nuclear genes, in particular mitochondrial polymerase gamma (POLG) and PEO1, have 
      been increasingly recognized to cause mitochondrial diseases. Both genes assume a 
      complementary role as part of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication fork and, 
      accordingly, seem to present with largely overlapping phenotypical spectra. We 
      assessed the frequency and phenotypic spectrum of PEO1 compared to POLG mutations 
      in a cohort of 80 patients with cerebellar ataxia for which common repeat 
      expansion diseases had been excluded. Patients were selected to present 
      additional features previously described for PEO1 mutations, namely early age of 
      onset, progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), or epilepsy. Whereas PEO1 
      mutations were not found in our cohort, POLG frequently caused ataxia with PEO 
      (47%), psychiatric comorbidities (20%) and, more rarely, with epilepsy (14%). 
      Thus, PEO1 is rare in Central Europe even in those patients displaying 
      characteristic phenotypic features. In contrast, POLG is rather common in Central 
      European ataxia patients. It should be particularly considered in ataxia patients 
      with PEO, psychiatric comorbidities, and/or sensory neuropathy, even if 
      characteristic mitochondrial extra-CNS features are absent.

TI  - Association between trinucleotide CAG repeats of the DNA polymerase gene (POLG) 
      with age of onset of Iranian Friedreich's ataxia patients.
PG  - 489-93
LID - 10.1007/s10072-008-1026-y [doi]
AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder, is 
      in most cases due to a homozygous intronic expansion resulting in the loss of 
      function of frataxin. As mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number has been decreased 
      in FRDA cells and mtDNA polymerase (POLG) is involved in the replication of 
      mtDNA, we searched a trinucleotide CAG repeat length of this enzyme. The POLG CAG 
      repeat length was determined in DNA samples extracted from 20 FRDA patients and 
      49 control subjects. Our findings showed that the distribution of the POLG CAG 
      repeat length in the patients' samples matched the distribution for control 
      samples, but we found a statistically significant inverse correlation (r=-0.81) 
      between the POLG CAG repeats and age of onset in FRDA patients. Our results 
      suggest POLG CAG repeat instability would constitute a predisposing factor that, 
      in combination with environmental risk factors, affect age of onset and disease 
      progression.

TI  - Analysis of the trinucleotide CAG repeat from the DNA polymerase gamma gene 
      (POLG) in patients with Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 56-9
AB  - The human gene for the catalytic subunit of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 
      polymerase (POLG) contains a trinucleotide CAG repeat encoding a polyglutamine 
      tract near the amino-terminus of the protein. Expansions of similar 
      polyglutamine-encoding CAG microsatellite repeats in other genes are known to 
      cause neurodegenerative disorders. As mitochondrial dysfunction has been 
      implicated in the aetiology of Parkinson's disease, we determined the POLG CAG 
      repeat length in DNA samples extracted from 22 idiopathic Parkinson's disease 
      patients and 31 control subjects. The distribution of the POLG CAG repeat length 
      in the control samples matched the distribution reported for control samples by 
      others. Comparison between the CAG repeat length distribution of control and 
      Parkinson's disease samples revealed no evidence of either germ line or somatic 
      POLG CAG repeat instability in Parkinson's disease patients. Our results rule out 
      POLG CAG repeat instability as a common pathogenic mechanism in idiopathic 
      Parkinson's disease.

TI  - Lack of correlation between length variation in the DNA polymerase gamma gene CAG 
      repeat and lactic acidosis or neuropathy during antiretroviral treatment.
PG  - 531-4
AB  - Antiretroviral therapy, although successful in reducing HIV load and accordingly 
      decreasing the incidence of HIV infection-related symptoms, has its drawbacks in 
      the form of severe side effects. Recognized drug-related side effects are, for 
      example, nausea, fatigue, lactic acidosis, neuropathy, lipodystrophy, and 
      myopathy. Because not all patients experience these side effects, genetic factors 
      could be involved. It is believed that the main toxicity of nucleoside analog 
      drugs is due to a decrease in mitochondrial function, possibly by inhibition of 
      mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication. mtDNA is replicated by a multienzyme 
      complex, the main component of which is the nuclear-encoded DNA polymerase gamma. 
      Presently, the only known variation in the DNA polymerase gamma gene is variation 
      in the number of CAG repeats in the second exon. To investigate whether CAG 
      repeat expansion or mutations in the DNA polymerase gamma (POLG) gene could 
      predispose to peripheral neuropathy or lactic acidosis, we have sequenced part of 
      the second exon of the DNA polymerase gamma gene, containing the CAG repeat, of 
      59 drug-treated HIV-infected patients, 11 of whom experienced drug-induced 
      neuropathy, and 3 of whom died from lactic acidosis. No correlation was found 
      between numbers of CAG repeats and any of the symptoms. The coding regions of the 
      POLG gene from the three lactic acidosis patients were then completely sequenced, 
      but no mutations were found. In addition, no variation was detected in exons 3, 
      8, and 19 of seven neuropathy patients and three control subjects without 
      symptoms. These exons were the only sites of amino acid changes between human and 
      chimpanzee POLG genes, and were chosen as targets of tolerated variation.

      polymerase gene in healthy and diseased individuals.
PG  - 140-6
AB  - The human nuclear gene (POLG) for the catalytic subunit of mitochondrial DNA 
      polymerase (DNA polymerase gamma) contains a trinucleotide CAG microsatellite 
      repeat within the coding sequence. We have investigated the frequency of 
      different repeat-length alleles in populations of diseased and healthy 
      individuals. The predominant allele of 10 CAG repeats was found at a very similar 
      frequency (approximately 88%) in both Finnish and ethnically mixed population 
      samples, with homozygosity close to the equilibrium prediction. Other alleles of 
      between 5 and 13 repeat units were detected, but no larger, expanded alleles were 
      found. A series of 51 British myotonic dystrophy patients showed no significant 
      variation from controls, indicating an absence of generalised CAG repeat 
      instability. Patients with a variety of molecular lesions in mtDNA, including 
      sporadic, clonal deletions, maternally inherited point mutations, autosomally 
      transmitted mtDNA depletion and autosomal dominant multiple deletions showed no 
      differences in POLG trinucleotide repeat-length distribution from controls. These 
      findings rule out POLG repeat expansion as a common pathogenic mechanism in 
      disorders characterised by mitochondrial genome instability.
