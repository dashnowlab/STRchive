AB  - Arthropods, the most diverse phylum on Earth, are hosts to a plethora of 
      bacterial parasites that secrete various effectors of unknown function during 
      infection. The most prevalent of these is the intracellular bacterium Wolbachia 
      pipientis . The microbe infects between 40-60% of insect species, causes 
      important reproductive manipulations, and limits virus replication in arthropod 
      vectors, becoming a promising biocontrol agent. Understanding the molecular basis 
      of Wolbachia infection and Wolbachia- induced phenotypes is critical to the use 
      of Wolbachia in vector control. These Wolbachia ankyrin repeat proteins (WARPs) 
      represent a highly dynamic and diverse part of the Wolbachia pangenome and remain 
      thus far, largely uncharacterized. Here, we perform molecular and genetic screens 
      to identify interactions between Wolbachia w Mel WARPs and their target host 
      proteins in Drosophila melanogaster . Our results identify strong interactions of 
      two Wolbachia proteins, WARP434 and WARP754, with two host targets (CG11327 and 
      Ptp61F, respectively). Heterologous expression of these two WARPs is extremely 
      toxic in Drosophila tissues and the toxicity is dependent on the ankyrin repeat 
      domain of each WARP. Importantly, knockdown of the host targets alleviates 
      toxicity, confirming WARP/target interactions. Finally, antibodies targeting both 
      WARPs show expression by Wolbachia during infection of Drosophila cells. 
      Understanding how Wolbachia manipulates its host biology and which host pathways 
      it targets during infection will help us divine how the most prevalent 
      intracellular bacterial parasite on Earth interacts with its insect hosts at the 
      molecular level. Our screen is the first step towards that goal. IMPORTANCE: 
      Molecular interactions drive co-evolutionary arms races between hosts and 
      pathogens. These interactions shape the structure and function of both host and 
      parasite proteins, enabling immunity or virulence during infection. Understanding 
      the molecular details that unfold during these events illustrates not only how 
      hosts and parasites co-evolve at the molecular level but also may help 
      characterize the function of poorly understood proteins. The most prevalent 
      intracellular infection on earth is Wolbachia pipientis, with between 40-60% of 
      insects harboring the bacterial symbiont. Understanding how Wolbachia infects 
      host cells and the molecular tools it uses to alter cell biology is critical to 
      the use of the microbe in vector control. Here, we identify Wolbachia proteins 
      used by the symbiont to interface with specific host proteins. Understanding the 
      molecular mechanisms underlying this host-microbe interaction will shed light on 
      how an important symbiont, used in the control of vector populations and disease 
      transmission, uses WARPs to interact with host targets and how targeting this 
      host protein contributes to infection.

TI  - An ancestral 10-bp repeat expansion in VWA1 causes recessive hereditary motor 
      neuropathy.
PG  - 584-600
LID - 10.1093/brain/awaa420 [doi]
AB  - The extracellular matrix comprises a network of macromolecules such as collagens, 
      proteoglycans and glycoproteins. VWA1 (von Willebrand factor A domain containing 
      1) encodes a component of the extracellular matrix that interacts with 
      perlecan/collagen VI, appears to be involved in stabilizing extracellular matrix 
      structures, and demonstrates high expression levels in tibial nerve. 
      Vwa1-deficient mice manifest with abnormal peripheral nerve structure/function; 
      however, VWA1 variants have not previously been associated with human disease. By 
      interrogating the genome sequences of 74 180 individuals from the 100K Genomes 
      Project in combination with international gene-matching efforts and targeted 
      sequencing, we identified 17 individuals from 15 families with an 
      autosomal-recessive, non-length dependent, hereditary motor neuropathy and rare 
      biallelic variants in VWA1. A single disease-associated allele p.(G25Rfs*74), a 
      10-bp repeat expansion, was observed in 14/15 families and was homozygous in 
      10/15. Given an allele frequency in European populations approaching 1/1000, the 
      seven unrelated homozygote individuals ascertained from the 100K Genomes Project 
      represents a substantial enrichment above expected. Haplotype analysis identified 
      a shared 220 kb region suggesting that this founder mutation arose >7000 years 
      ago. A wide age-range of patients (6-83 years) helped delineate the clinical 
      phenotype over time. The commonest disease presentation in the cohort was an 
      early-onset (mean 2.0 +/- 1.4 years) non-length-dependent axonal hereditary motor 
      neuropathy, confirmed on electrophysiology, which will have to be differentiated 
      from other predominantly or pure motor neuropathies and neuronopathies. Because 
      of slow disease progression, ambulation was largely preserved. Neurophysiology, 
      muscle histopathology, and muscle MRI findings typically revealed clear 
      neurogenic changes with single isolated cases displaying additional myopathic 
      process. We speculate that a few findings of myopathic changes might be secondary 
      to chronic denervation rather than indicating an additional myopathic disease 
      process. Duplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and 
      immunoblotting using patient fibroblasts revealed that the founder allele results 
      in partial nonsense mediated decay and an absence of detectable protein. CRISPR 
      and morpholino vwa1 modelling in zebrafish demonstrated reductions in motor 
      neuron axonal growth, synaptic formation in the skeletal muscles and locomotive 
      behaviour. In summary, we estimate that biallelic variants in VWA1 may be 
      responsible for up to 1% of unexplained hereditary motor neuropathy cases in 
      Europeans. The detailed clinical characterization provided here will facilitate 
      targeted testing on suitable patient cohorts. This novel disease gene may have 
      previously evaded detection because of high GC content, consequential low 
      coverage and computational difficulties associated with robustly detecting 
      repeat-expansions. Reviewing previously unsolved exomes using lower QC filters 
      may generate further diagnoses.
