AB  - OBJECTIVE: Late-onset cerebellar ataxia (LOCA) is a slowly progressive cerebellar 
      disorder with symptom onset >/=30years of age. Intronic tandem repeat expansions 
      (TREs) in RFC1 and FGF14 have recently emerged as common causes of LOCA. The 
      relative contribution of classic vs. newly discovered TREs has not been 
      systematically investigated in LOCA cohorts. METHODS: Over 28 years, 206 
      consecutive Greek LOCA index patients were referred for genetic testing and, 
      based on clinical data and inheritance pattern, screened for FRDA, SCA1,2,3,6,7, 
      FXTAS, CANVAS and SCA27B. RESULTS: A genetic diagnosis was reached in 62 of 206 
      cases (30.1 %). Mean age was 60.1 +/- 11.2 (35-87) years and mean age at onset 
      (AAO) 52.5 +/- 11.4 (30-80) years. SCA27B accounted for 9.7 % of LOCA cases, CANVAS 
      for 7.8 % and FRDA for 4.4 %. The overall frequency of SCA1, SCA2 and SCA7 was 
      6.8 %. No cases of SCA3 and SCA6 were identified. FXTAS contributed 1.5 % of 
      cases. In sporadic cases, the diagnostic yield was 22.8 % (34 of 149; SCA27B: 
      8.7 %, CANVAS: 8.1 %, FRDA: 2.7 %, SCA2: 1.3 %, FXTAS: 1.3 % and SCA7: 0.7 %). In 
      familial cases, the diagnostic yield was 49.1 % (28 of 57). Two cases with CANVAS 
      had pseudodominant inheritance. Patients with SCA27B, CANVAS and FXTAS had mean 
      AAO > 50 years, whereas patients with FRDA, SCA1, SCA2 and SCA7 had mean 
      AAO < 50 years. CONCLUSION: Recently-discovered TREs causing SCA27B and CANVAS 
      represent the commonest known genetic causes of LOCA. Prioritizing testing for 
      FGF14 and RFC1 expansions in the diagnostic algorithm of LOCA is recommended.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by a CAG-polyglutamine repeat expansion. Purkinje cells (PCs) are central 
      to the pathology of ataxias, but their low abundance in the cerebellum 
      underrepresents their transcriptomes in sequencing assays. To address this issue, 
      we developed a PC enrichment protocol and sequenced individual nuclei from mice 
      and patients with SCA7. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing in SCA7-266Q mice revealed 
      dysregulation of cell identity genes affecting glia and PCs. Specifically, genes 
      marking zebrin-II PC subtypes accounted for the highest proportion of DEGs in 
      symptomatic SCA7-266Q mice. These transcriptomic changes in SCA7-266Q mice were 
      associated with increased numbers of inhibitory synapses as quantified by 
      immunohistochemistry and reduced spiking of PCs in acute brain slices. 
      Dysregulation of zebrin-II cell subtypes was the predominant signal in PCs of 
      SCA7-266Q mice and was associated with the loss of zebrin-II striping in the 
      cerebellum at motor symptom onset. We furthermore demonstrated zebrin-II stripe 
      degradation in additional mouse models of polyglutamine ataxia and observed 
      decreased zebrin-II expression in the cerebella of patients with SCA7. Our 
      results suggest that a breakdown of zebrin subtype regulation is a shared 
      pathological feature of polyglutamine ataxias.

LID - 10.1007/s12311-024-01745-3 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a diverse group of hereditary 
      neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive degeneration of the 
      cerebellum and other parts of the nervous system. In this study, we examined the 
      genotype...phenotype correlations in SCAs within the Brazilian population by 
      leveraging a comprehensive dataset of 763 individuals from SARAH Network of 
      Rehabilitation Hospitals. Using a retrospective, cross-sectional, observational, 
      multicentric approach, we analysed medical records and conducted standardized 
      molecular testing to explore epidemiological characteristics, clinical 
      manifestations, and genetic profiles of SCAs in Brazil. Our findings revealed the 
      predominance of SCA3, followed by SCA7 and SCA2, which aligns with global trends 
      and reflects the specific genetic landscape of Brazil. A significant inverse 
      relationship between the age of symptom onset and CAG repeat length in the 
      mutated allele was observed across SCAs 2, 3, and 7. This study also highlights a 
      trend towards paternal inheritance in SCA2 and details the distribution of CAG 
      repeat expansions, which correlates larger expansions with earlier onset and 
      specific symptomatology. This extensive analysis underscores the critical 
      importance of genetic testing in the diagnosis and management of SCAs and 
      enlightens the intricate genotype...phenotype interplay within a genetically 
      diverse population. Despite certain limitations, such as potential selection bias 
      and the retrospective nature of the study, our research provides invaluable 
      insights into the prevalence, genetic underpinnings, and clinical variability of 
      SCAs in Brazil. We suggest a broader demographic scope and investigations into 
      nonmotor symptoms in future studies to obtain a more comprehensive understanding 
      of SCAs.

COIS- Declarations. Human Ethics and Consent to Participate: Not applicable. 
      Considering that this retrospective study was conducted only from data collected 
      from medical records and anonymized, which included individuals followed up in 
      units of the SARAH Network of Rehabilitation Hospitals located outside the state 
      of Rio de Janeiro, obtaining consent to participate in the Declaration was 
      waived. In addition, many patients had already died or interrupted the clinical 
      follow-up, and the COVID-19 pandemic transformed many consultations into 
      teleconsultations, which made it difficult to obtain consent to comply with the 
      Declaration of Helsinki if desired. Competing Interests: The authors declare no

LID - 10.1172/jci.insight.170444 [doi]
LID - e170444
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is an autosomal dominant neurological 
      disorder caused by deleterious CAG repeat expansion in the coding region of the 
      ataxin 7 gene (polyQ-ataxin-7). Infantile-onset SCA7 leads to severe clinical 
      manifestation of respiratory distress, but the exact cause of respiratory 
      impairment remains unclear. Using the infantile-SCA7 mouse model, the SCA7266Q/5Q 
      mouse, we examined the impact of pathological polyQ-ataxin-7 on hypoglossal (XII) 
      and phrenic motor units. We identified the transcript profile of the medulla and 
      cervical spinal cord and investigated the XII and phrenic nerves and the 
      neuromuscular junctions in the diaphragm and tongue. SCA7266Q/5Q astrocytes 
      showed significant intranuclear inclusions of ataxin-7 in the XII and putative 
      phrenic motor nuclei. Transcriptomic analysis revealed dysregulation of genes 
      involved in amino acid and neurotransmitter transport and myelination. 
      Additionally, SCA7266Q/5Q mice demonstrated blunted efferent output of the XII 
      nerve and demyelination in both XII and phrenic nerves. Finally, there was an 
      increased number of neuromuscular junction clusters with higher expression of 
      synaptic markers in SCA7266Q/5Q mice compared with WT controls. These preclinical 
      findings elucidate the underlying pathophysiology responsible for impaired glial 
      cell function and death leading to dysphagia, aspiration, and respiratory failure 
      in infantile SCA7.

AB  - There is an obvious clinical-pathological overlap between essential tremor and 
      some known tremor-associated short tandem repeat expansion disorders. The aim is 
      to analyse whether these short tandem repeat genes, including ATXN1, ATXN2, 
      ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, ATXN8OS, ATXN10, PPP2R2B, TBP, BEAN1, NOP56, DAB1, ATN1, 
      SADM12 and FMR1, are associated with familial essential tremor patients. Genetic 
      analysis of repeat sizes in tremor-associated short tandem repeat expansions was 
      performed in a large cohort of 515 familial essential tremor probands and 300 
      controls. The demographic and clinical features among carriers of pathogenic 
      expansions, intermediate repeats and non-carriers were compared. A total of 18 
      out of 515 (18/515, 3.7%) patients were found to have repeats expansions, 
      including 12 cases (12/515, 2.5%) with intermediate repeat expansions (one ATXN1, 
      eight TBP, two FMR1, one ATN1), and six cases (6/515, 1.2%) with pathogenic 
      expansions (one ATXN1, one ATXN2, one ATXN8OS, one PPP2R2B, one FMR1, one 
      SAMD12). There were no statistically significant differences in intermediate 
      repeats compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, there were no significant 
      differences in demographics and clinical features among individuals with 
      pathogenic expansions, intermediate repeat expansions carriers and non-carriers. 
      Our study indicates that the intermediate repeat expansion in tremor-associated 
      short tandem repeat expansions does not pose an increased risk for essential 
      tremor, and rare pathogenic expansion carriers have been found in the familial 
      essential tremor cohort. The diagnosis of essential tremor based solely on 
      clinical symptoms remains a challenge in distinguishing it from known short 
      tandem repeat expansions diseases with overlapping clinical-pathological 
      features.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
      resulting from abnormal expansion of an uninterrupted polyglutamine (polyQ) 
      repeat in its disease protein, ataxin-7 (ATXN7). ATXN7 is part of Spt-Ada-Gcn5 
      acetyltransferase (SAGA), an evolutionarily conserved transcriptional 
      coactivation complex with critical roles in chromatin remodeling, cell signaling, 
      neurodifferentiation, mitochondrial health and autophagy. SCA7 is dominantly 
      inherited and characterized by genetic anticipation and high repeat-length 
      instability. Patients with SCA7 experience progressive ataxia, atrophy, 
      spasticity, and blindness. There is currently no cure for SCA7, and therapies are 
      aimed at alleviating symptoms to increase quality of life. Here, we report novel 
      Drosophila lines of SCA7 with polyQ repeats in wild-type and human disease 
      patient range. We find that ATXN7 expression has age- and polyQ repeat 
      length-dependent reduction in fruit fly survival and retinal instability, 
      concomitant with increased ATXN7 protein aggregation. These new lines will 
      provide important insight on disease progression that can be used in the future 
      to identify therapeutic targets for SCA7 patients.

AB  - Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 7 (SCA7) is an autosomal dominantly inherited 
      disorder, primarily characterized by cerebellar ataxia and visual loss. SCA7 is 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in exon 3 of the ATXN7 gene. We generated human 
      induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from peripheral blood-derived 
      erythroblasts from two SCA7 patients (LUMCi051-A,B and LUMCi052-A,B,C) using 
      integration-free episomal vectors. All hiPSC clones express pluripotency factors, 
      show a normal karyotype, and can differentiate into the three germ layers. These 
      lines can be used for in vitro disease modeling and therapy testing.

TI  - AAV-Mediated CAG-Targeting Selectively Reduces Polyglutamine-Expanded Protein and 
      Attenuates Disease Phenotypes in a Spinocerebellar Ataxia Mouse Model.
LID - 10.3390/ijms25084354 [doi]

AB  - Polyglutamine (polyQ)-encoding CAG repeat expansions represent a common 
      disease-causing mutation responsible for several dominant spinocerebellar ataxias 
      (SCAs). PolyQ-expanded SCA proteins are toxic for cerebellar neurons, with 
      Purkinje cells (PCs) being the most vulnerable. RNA interference (RNAi) reagents 
      targeting transcripts with expanded CAG reduce the level of various mutant SCA 
      proteins in an allele-selective manner in vitro and represent promising universal 
      tools for treating multiple CAG/polyQ SCAs. However, it remains unclear whether 
      the therapeutic targeting of CAG expansion can be achieved in vivo and if it can 
      ameliorate cerebellar functions. Here, using a mouse model of SCA7 expressing a 
      mutant Atxn7 allele with 140 CAGs, we examined the efficacy of short hairpin RNAs 
      (shRNAs) targeting CAG repeats expressed from PHP.eB adeno-associated virus 
      vectors (AAVs), which were introduced into the brain via intravascular injection. 
      We demonstrated that shRNAs carrying various mismatches with the CAG target 
      sequence reduced the level of polyQ-expanded ATXN7 in the cerebellum, albeit with 
      varying degrees of allele selectivity and safety profile. An shRNA named A4 
      potently reduced the level of polyQ-expanded ATXN7, with no effect on normal 
      ATXN7 levels and no adverse side effects. Furthermore, A4 shRNA treatment 
      improved a range of motor and behavioral parameters 23 weeks after AAV injection 
      and attenuated the disease burden of PCs by preventing the downregulation of 
      several PC-type-specific genes. Our results show the feasibility of the selective 
      targeting of CAG expansion in the cerebellum using a blood-brain 
      barrier-permeable vector to attenuate the disease phenotype in an SCA mouse 
      model. Our study represents a significant advancement in developing CAG-targeting 
      strategies as a potential therapy for SCA7 and possibly other CAG/polyQ SCAs.

AB  - Expanded CAG repeats in coding regions of different genes are the most common 
      cause of dominantly inherited spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). These repeats are 
      unstable through the germline, and larger repeats lead to earlier onset. We 
      measured somatic expansion in blood samples collected from 30 SCA1, 50 SCA2, 74 
      SCA3, and 30 SCA7 individuals over a mean interval of 8.5 years, along with 
      postmortem tissues and fetal tissues from SCA1, SCA3, and SCA7 individuals to 
      examine somatic expansion at different stages of life. We showed that somatic 
      mosaicism in the blood increases over time. Expansion levels are significantly 
      different among SCAs and correlate with CAG repeat lengths. The level of 
      expansion is greater in individuals with SCA7 who manifest disease compared to 
      that of those who do not yet display symptoms. Brain tissues from SCA individuals 
      have larger expansions compared to the blood. The cerebellum has the lowest 
      mosaicism among the studied brain regions, along with a high expression of ATXNs 
      and DNA repair genes. This was the opposite in cortices, with the highest 
      mosaicism and lower expression of ATXNs and DNA repair genes. Fetal cortices did 
      not show repeat instability. This study shows that CAG repeats are increasingly 
      unstable during life in the blood and the brain of SCA individuals, with gene- 
      and tissue-specific patterns.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Essential tremor (ET) is a neurological disease characterized by 
      action tremor in upper arms. Although its high heritability and prevalence 
      worldwide, its etiology and association with other diseases are still unknown. 
      METHOD: We investigated 10 common spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), including SCA1, 
      SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, SCA17, SCA36, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA) in 92 early-onset familial ET pedigrees in China collected from 
      2016 to 2022. RESULT: We found one SCA12 proband carried 51 CAG repeats within 
      PPP2R2B gene and one SCA3 proband with intermediate CAG repeats (55) with ATXN3 
      gene. The other 90 ET probands all had normal repeat expansions. CONCLUSION: 
      Tremor can be the initial phenotype of certain SCA. For early-onset, familial ET 
      patients, careful physical examinations are needed before genetic SCA screening.

AB  - The Cerebellar Cognitive Affective/Schmahmann Syndrome (CCAS) manifests as 
      impaired executive control, linguistic processing, visual spatial function, and 
      affect regulation. The CCAS has been described in the spinocerebellar ataxias 
      (SCAs), but its prevalence is unknown. We analyzed results of the CCAS/Schmahmann 
      Scale (CCAS-S), developed to detect and quantify CCAS, in two natural history 
      studies of 309 individuals Symptomatic for SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, or SCA8, 
      26 individuals Pre-symptomatic for SCA1 or SCA3, and 37 Controls. We compared 
      total raw scores, domain scores, and total fail scores between Symptomatic, 
      Pre-symptomatic, and Control cohorts, and between SCA types. We calculated scale 
      sensitivity and selectivity based on CCAS category designation among Symptomatic 
      individuals and Controls, and correlated CCAS-S performance against age and 
      education, and in Symptomatic patients, against genetic repeat length, onset age, 
      disease duration, motor ataxia, depression, and fatigue. Definite CCAS was 
      identified in 46% of the Symptomatic group. False positive rate among Controls 
      was 5.4%. Symptomatic individuals had poorer global CCAS-S performance than 
      Controls, accounting for age and education. The domains of semantic fluency, 
      phonemic fluency, and category switching that tap executive function and 
      linguistic processing consistently separated Symptomatic individuals from 
      Controls. CCAS-S scores correlated most closely with motor ataxia. Controls were 
      similar to Pre-symptomatic individuals whose nearness to symptom onset was 
      unknown. The use of the CCAS-S identifies a high CCAS prevalence in a large 
      cohort of SCA patients, underscoring the utility of the scale and the notion that 
      the CCAS is the third cornerstone of clinical ataxiology.

AB  - Neurologists have a difficult time identifying sporadic cerebellar ataxia. 
      Multiple system atrophy of the cerebellar type (MSA-C), spontaneous late cortical 
      cerebellar atrophy, and prolonged alcohol use are a few possible causes. In a 
      group of people with sporadic cerebellar ataxia that was not MSA-C, an 
      autosomal-dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) mutation was recently discovered. 
      Chinese single-hospital cohort will be used in this study to genetic screen for 
      SCA-related genes. One hundred forty individuals with CA were monitored over 8 
      years. Thirty-one individuals had familial CA, 109 patients had sporadic CA, 73 
      had MSA-C, and 36 had non-MSA-C sporadic CA. In 28 of the 31 non-MSA-C sporadic 
      patients who requested the test, we carried out gene analysis, including SCA1, 
      SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, SCA17, SCA31, and 
      dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). The control group consisted of 
      family members of the patients. In 57% of the instances with spontaneous CA that 
      were not MSA-C, gene abnormalities were discovered. The most frequent exception 
      among individuals with sporadic CA was SCA6 (36%), followed by monsters in SCA1, 
      2, 3, 8, and DRPLA. In contrast, 75% of the patients with familial CA had gene 
      abnormalities, the most frequent of which was SCA6 abnormality. The age of 69 vs 
      59 was higher, and the CAG repeat length was a minor age of 23 vs 25 in the 
      former instances compared to the last one among individuals with SCA6 anomalies 
      that were sporadic as opposed to familial cases. In sporadic CA, 
      autosomal-dominant mutations in SCA genes, notably in SCA6, are common. Although 
      the cause of the increased incidence of SCA6 mutations is unknown, it may be 
      related to a greater age of onset and varied penetrance of SCA6 mutations.

AB  - In Japan, approximately 30% of spinocerebellar degeneration (SCD) is hereditary, 
      and more than 90% of hereditary SCD is autosomal dominant SCD (AD-SCD). We have 
      previously reported the types of AD-SCD in Hokkaido, twice. In this study, we 
      investigated the status of AD-SCD mainly due to repeat expansions, covering the 
      period since the last report. We performed genetic analysis for 312 patients with 
      a clinical diagnosis of SCD, except for multiple system atrophy at medical 
      institutions in Hokkaido between January 2007 and December 2020. The median age 
      at the time of analysis was 58 (1-86) years. Pathogenic variants causing AD-SCD 
      due to repeat expansion were found in 61.5% (192 cases). Spinocerebellar ataxia 
      (SCA) 6 was the most common type in 25.3% (79 cases), followed by Machado-Joseph 
      disease (MJD)/SCA3 in 13.8% (43), SCA1 in 6.4% (20), SCA2 in 5.1% (16), SCA31 in 
      4.8% (15), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy in 4.8% (15), SCA7 in 0.6% (2), 
      and SCA8 in 0.6% (2). SCA17, 27B, 36, and 37 were not found. Compared to previous 
      reports, this study found a higher prevalence of SCA6 and a lower prevalence of 
      MJD/SCA3. An increasing number of cases identified by genetic testing, including 
      cases with no apparent family history, accurately revealed the distribution of 
      disease types in Hokkaido.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: We present the first two Polish families diagnosed with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) and draw attention to cardiac involvement as 
      a new potential manifestation of this disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two 
      well-documented kindreds are presented. RESULTS: The proband from Family 1 
      presented aged 54 years with vision worsening followed by progressive imbalance. 
      Brain MRI demonstrated cerebellar atrophy. Genetic testing confirmed CAG repeat 
      expansion (42/10) in ATXN7 gene. The proband from Family 2 developed imbalance at 
      age 20, followed by progressive deterioration of vision. Brain MRI revealed 
      cerebellar atrophy. Additionally, she developed chronic congestive heart failure 
      and, at age 38, had cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20% and 
      significant mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Genetic analysis found abnormal 
      CAG expansion in the ATXN7 (46/10). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Vision 
      loss due to pigmentary retinal degeneration is the distinguishing feature of SCA7 
      and often the initial manifestation. Although SCA7 is one of the most common SCAs 
      in Sweden, it has never been reported in neighbouring Poland. Until now, cardiac 
      abnormalities have only been described in infantile-onset SCA7 with large CAG 
      repeats. The observed cardiac involvement in Family 2 may be coincidental, albeit 
      a new possible manifestation of SCA7 cannot be excluded.

AB  - Cerebellar ataxias (CAs) represent a group of autosomal dominant and recessive 
      neurodegenerative disorders affecting cerebellum with or without spinal cord. 
      Overall, CAs have preponderance for tandem nucleotide repeat expansions as an 
      etiological factor (10 TREs explain nearly 30-40% of ataxia cohort globally). The 
      experience of 10 years of common genetic ataxia subtypes for  approximately 5600 patients' 
      referrals (Pan-India) received at a single center is shared herein. Frequencies 
      (in %, n) of SCA types and FRDA in the sample cohort are observed as follows: 
      SCA12 (8.6%, 490); SCA2 (8.5%, 482); SCA1 (4.8%, 272); SCA3 (2%, 113); SCA7 
      (0.5%, 28); SCA6 (0.1%, 05); SCA17 (0.1%, 05), and FRDA (2.2%, 127). A 
      significant amount of variability in TRE lengths at each locus is observed, we 
      noted presence of biallelic expansion, co-occurrence of SCA-subtypes, and the 
      presence of premutable normal alleles. The frequency of mutated GAA-FRDA allele 
      in healthy controls is 1/158 (0.63%), thus an expected FRDA prevalence of 1:100 
      000 persons. The data of this study are relevant not only for clinical decision 
      making but also for guidance in direction of genetic investigations, 
      transancestral comparison of genotypes, and lastly provide insight for policy 
      decision for the consideration of SCAs under rare disease category.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic efficacy of clinical 
      exome-targeted sequencing (CES) and spinocerebellar ataxia 36 (SCA36) screening 
      in a real-life cohort of patients with cerebellar ataxia (CA) from Eastern Spain. 
      METHODS: A total of 130 unrelated patients with CA, negative for common 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, 
      SCA17, dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy [DRPLA], and Friedreich ataxia), were 
      studied with CES. Bioinformatic and genotype-phenotype analyses were performed to 
      assess the pathogenicity of the variants encountered. Copy number variants were 
      analyzed when appropriate. In undiagnosed dominant and sporadic cases, repeat 
      primed PCR was used to screen for the presence of a repeat expansion in the NOP56 
      gene. RESULTS: CES identified pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 50 
      families (39%), including 23 novel variants. Overall, there was a high genetic 
      heterogeneity, and the most frequent genetic diagnosis was SPG7 (n = 15), 
      followed by SETX (n = 6), CACNA1A (n = 5), POLR3A (n = 4), and SYNE1 (n = 3). In 
      addition, 17 families displayed likely pathogenic/pathogenic variants in 14 
      different genes: KCND3 (n = 2), KIF1C (n = 2), CYP27A1A (n = 2), AFG3L2 (n = 1), 
      ANO10 (n = 1), CAPN1 (n = 1), CWF19L1 (n = 1), ITPR1 (n = 1), KCNA1 (n = 1), OPA1 
      (n = 1), PNPLA6 (n = 1), SPG11 (n = 1), SPTBN2 (n = 1), and TPP1 (n = 1). 
      Twenty-two novel variants were characterized. SCA36 was diagnosed in 11 families, 
      all with autosomal dominant (AD) presentation. SCA36 screening increased the 
      total diagnostic rate to 47% (n = 61/130). Ultimately, undiagnosed patients 
      showed delayed age at onset (p < 0.05) and were more frequently sporadic. 
      DISCUSSION: Our study provides insight into the genetic landscape of CA in 
      Eastern Spain. Although CES was an effective approach to capture genetic 
      heterogeneity, most patients remained undiagnosed. SCA36 was found to be a 
      relatively frequent form and, therefore, should be tested prior to CES in 
      familial AD presentations in particular geographical regions.

AB  - CAG-expanded ATXN7 has been previously defined in the pathogenesis of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7), a polyglutamine expansion autosomal 
      dominant cerebellar ataxia. Pathology in SCA7 occurs as a result of a CAG triplet 
      repeat expansion in excess of 37 in the first exon of ATXN7, which encodes 
      ataxin-7. SCA7 presents clinically with spinocerebellar ataxia and cone-rod 
      dystrophy. Here, we present a novel spinocerebellar ataxia variant occurring in a 
      patient with mutations in both ATXN7 and TOP1MT, which encodes mitochondrial 
      topoisomerase I (top1mt). Using machine-guided, unbiased microscopy image 
      analysis, we demonstrate alterations in ataxin-7 subcellular localization, and 
      through high-fidelity measurements of cellular respiration, bioenergetic defects 
      in association with top1mt mutations. We identify ataxin-7 Q35P and top1mt R111W 
      as deleterious mutations, potentially contributing to disease states. We 
      recapitulate our mutations through Drosophila genetic models. Our work provides 
      important insight into the cellular biology of ataxin-7 and top1mt and offers 
      insight into the pathogenesis of spinocerebellar ataxia applicable to multiple 
      subtypes of the illness. Moreover, our study demonstrates an effective pipeline 
      for the characterization of previously unreported genetic variants at the level 
      of cell biology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Repeat expansion disorders affect about 1 in 3000 individuals and are 
      clinically heterogeneous diseases caused by expansions of short tandem DNA 
      repeats. Genetic testing is often locus-specific, resulting in underdiagnosis of 
      people who have atypical clinical presentations, especially in paediatric 
      patients without a previous positive family history. Whole genome sequencing is 
      increasingly used as a first-line test for other rare genetic disorders, and we 
      aimed to assess its performance in the diagnosis of patients with neurological 
      repeat expansion disorders. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed the diagnostic 
      accuracy of whole genome sequencing to detect the most common repeat expansion 
      loci associated with neurological outcomes (AR, ATN1, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, 
      C9orf72, CACNA1A, DMPK, FMR1, FXN, HTT, and TBP) using samples obtained within 
      the National Health Service in England from patients who were suspected of having 
      neurological disorders; previous PCR test results were used as the reference 
      standard. The clinical accuracy of whole genome sequencing to detect repeat 
      expansions was prospectively examined in previously genetically tested and 
      undiagnosed patients recruited in 2013-17 to the 100 000 Genomes Project in the 
      UK, who were suspected of having a genetic neurological disorder (familial or 
      early-onset forms of ataxia, neuropathy, spastic paraplegia, dementia, motor 
      neuron disease, parkinsonian movement disorders, intellectual disability, or 
      neuromuscular disorders). If a repeat expansion call was made using whole genome 
      sequencing, PCR was used to confirm the result. FINDINGS: The diagnostic accuracy 
      of whole genome sequencing to detect repeat expansions was evaluated against 793 
      PCR tests previously performed within the NHS from 404 patients. Whole genome 
      sequencing correctly classified 215 of 221 expanded alleles and 1316 of 1321 
      non-expanded alleles, showing 97.3% sensitivity (95% CI 94.2-99.0) and 99.6% 
      specificity (99.1-99.9) across the 13 disease-associated loci when compared with 
      PCR test results. In samples from 11 631 patients in the 100 000 Genomes Project, 
      whole genome sequencing identified 81 repeat expansions, which were also tested 
      by PCR: 68 were confirmed as repeat expansions in the full pathogenic range, 11 
      were non-pathogenic intermediate expansions or premutations, and two were 
      non-expanded repeats (16% false discovery rate). INTERPRETATION: In our study, 
      whole genome sequencing for the detection of repeat expansions showed high 
      sensitivity and specificity, and it led to identification of neurological repeat 
      expansion disorders in previously undiagnosed patients. These findings support 
      implementation of whole genome sequencing in clinical laboratories for diagnosis 
      of patients who have a neurological presentation consistent with a repeat 
      expansion disorder. FUNDING: Medical Research Council, Department of Health and

TI  - Genetic Distribution of Five Spinocerebellar Ataxia Microsatellite Loci in 
      Mexican Native American Populations and Its Impact on Contemporary Mestizo 
      Populations.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) conform a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      disorders with autosomal dominant inheritance. Five of the most frequent SCAs are 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the exons of specific genes. The SCAs 
      incidence and the distribution of polymorphic CAG alleles vary among populations 
      and ethnicities. Thus, characterization of the genetic architecture of ethnically 
      diverse populations, which have undergone recent admixture and demographic 
      events, could facilitate the identification of genetic risk factors. Owing to the 
      great ethnic diversity of the Mexican population, this study aimed to analyze the 
      allele frequencies of five SCA microsatellite loci (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and 
      SCA7) in eleven Mexican Native American (MNA) populations. Data from the 
      literature were used to compare the allelic distribution of SCA loci with 
      worldwide populations. The SCA loci allelic frequencies evidenced a certain 
      genetic homogeneity in the MNA populations, except for Mayans, who exhibited 
      distinctive genetic profiles. Neither pathological nor large normal alleles were 
      found in MNA populations, except for the SCA2 pre-mutated allele in the Zapotec 
      population. Collectively, our findings demonstrated the contribution of the MNA 
      ancestry in shaping the genetic structure of contemporary Mexican Mestizo 
      populations. Our results also suggest that Native American ancestry has no impact 
      on the origin of SCAs in the Mexican population. Instead, the acquisition of 
      pathological SCA alleles could be associated with European migration.

LID - 10.1080/21678421.2021.1998537 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is an autosomal dominant hereditary 
      neurodegenerative disease caused by the expansion of a CAG-repeat in the ataxin-7 
      (ATXN7) gene, usually characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia and retinal 
      dystrophy. We report the case of a 45-year-old woman presenting with a 
      rapid-onset amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) phenotype associated with a 
      39-CAG-repeat expansion in ATXN7. This patient had neither ataxia nor retinal 
      dystrophy, but she had an oculomotor cerebellar syndrome and a family history 
      suggestive of SCA7. In SCA7, shorter expansions may be associated with less 
      severe and incomplete clinical phenotypes, which could explain the patient's 
      phenotype. Unknown genetic and environmental factors may also influence the 
      patient's phenotype. We suggest that a pathological expansion in ATXN7 should be 
      considered in cases of ALS-like phenotype, particularly when associated with 
      oculomotor abnormalities or a family history of ataxia or blindness.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is one of the most common 
      autosomal dominant ataxias in the world. Several reports revealed that CAG 
      repeats in some polyQ-containing genes may affect the age at onset (AAO) of 
      patients with SCA2, however, little studies were conducted among Chinese patients 
      with SCA2. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of CAG repeats 
      on the AAO of patients with SCA2 in China. METHODS: A total of 119 patients with 
      SCA2 were enrolled and were divided into 2 groups according to their major 
      phenotype: 17 patients from 9 families with Parkinson's syndrome were grouped as 
      the Parkinson's disease-SCA2 (PD-SAC2); 91 patients from 66 SCA2 families and 11 
      sporadic SCA2 patients were grouped as the ataxia-SCA2 (A-SCA2). Blood samples 
      were obtained from the subjects, and the CAG repeat length in ATXN2 and other 
      (CAG)(n)-containing genes was screened using fluorescent PCR. The Spearman's rank 
      correlation between the CAG repeat length in (CAG)(n)-containing genes and AAO 
      was analyzed. Regression analysis was performed to investigate whether the CAG 
      repeat length could explain the variant of AAO. A t-test was used to compare the 
      difference of CAG repeat length in (CAG)(n)-containing genes between the PD-SAC2 
      and A-SCA2 groups. RESULTS: The CAG repeat length in the longer allele of ATXN2 
      was negatively correlated with AAO of SCA2 (R=-0.251, P<0.05), and the CAG repeat 
      length could explain 41.7% of the variation of AAO. AAO negatively correlated 
      with the CAG repeat length in the shorter allele of ATXN7 (R=-0.251, P=0.006) or 
      in the longer allele of TBP gene (R=-0.197, P=0.034). A tendency of delay in the 
      AAO was also observed in patients with SCA2 carrying the CAG repeat within the 
      ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, and RAI1. In addition, we found that the CAG repeat 
      length in ATXN7 and ATXN2 between the A-SCA2 and the PD-SCA2 groups was 
      significantly different (both P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The CAG repeat in ATXN2 is a 
      major genetic factor for the AAO of patients with SCA2 in China. The CAG repeat 
      length in ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, and RAI1 genes might be a potential factor 
      associated with the AAO of SCA2. The CAG repeat in ATXN7 might be a potential 
      factor affecting the Parkinson's syndrome in SCA2.

LID - 10.1242/dmm.048893 [doi]
LID - dmm048893
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the coding region of the ataxin-7 
      gene. Infantile-onset SCA7 patients display extremely large repeat expansions 
      (>200 CAGs) and exhibit progressive ataxia, dysarthria, dysphagia and retinal 
      degeneration. Severe hypotonia, aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure 
      often contribute to death in affected infants. To better understand the features 
      of respiratory and upper airway dysfunction in SCA7, we examined breathing and 
      putative phrenic and hypoglossal neuropathology in a knock-in mouse model of 
      early-onset SCA7 carrying an expanded allele with 266 CAG repeats. Whole-body 
      plethysmography was used to measure awake spontaneously breathing SCA7-266Q 
      knock-in mice at baseline in normoxia and during a hypercapnic/hypoxic 
      respiratory challenge at 4 and 8 weeks, before and after the onset of disease. 
      Postmortem studies included quantification of putative phrenic and hypoglossal 
      motor neurons and microglia, and analysis of ataxin-7 aggregation at end stage. 
      SCA7-266Q mice had profound breathing deficits during a respiratory challenge, 
      exhibiting reduced respiratory output and a greater percentage of time in apnea. 
      Histologically, putative phrenic and hypoglossal motor neurons of SCA7 mice 
      exhibited a reduction in number accompanied by increased microglial activation, 
      indicating neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. Furthermore, intranuclear 
      ataxin-7 accumulation was observed in cells neighboring putative phrenic and 
      hypoglossal motor neurons in SCA7 mice. These findings reveal the importance of 
      phrenic and hypoglossal motor neuron pathology associated with respiratory 
      failure and upper airway dysfunction, which are observed in infantile-onset SCA7 
      patients and likely contribute to their early death.

AB  - Spinocerebellar Ataxia (SCA) is a heterogeneous adult-onset disorder with an 
      autosomal dominant inheritance pattern mainly caused by triplet repeat 
      expansions. Clinical diagnosis of SCA is based on phenotypic features followed by 
      confirmation through molecular diagnosis. To identify status of repeat range in 
      Indian SCA cases and provide extended family screening, we enrolled 70 clinical 
      SCA suspects. For molecular diagnosis, multiplex PCR (M-PCR) was used for common 
      Indian SCA subtypes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 12 and 17. TP-PCR was further used in 
      SCA2, 7 and 10 to identify larger expansions. Eighteen out of 70 SCA suspects 
      (25%) were found to be positive for various SCA subtypes- (5 SCA1 (28%), 6 SAC2 
      (34%), 2 SCA3 (12%), 3 SCA7 (16%) and one each for SCA6 (1%) and SCA17 (1%) 
      subtypes). Genetic counselling and extended family screening were offered to all 
      positive cases and yielded additional nine cases. We have established M-PCR and 
      TP-PCR to detect the CAG repeat expansion in SCA suspects. This method can 
      confirm SCA subtypes in a reliable, rapid and cost-effective way. Genetic 
      characterization of SCA-related genes has great clinical relevance, as it could 
      provide additional information and guidance to clinicians and family members 
      regarding prognosis.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a rare autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disease. Its clinical presentation is a progressive cerebellar 
      ataxia associated with cone and retinal dystrophy. The CAG repeat expansion in 
      the ataxin-7 gene (ATXN7) causes spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 - a mutation that 
      results in the degeneration of the brain stem cells, retina and cerebellum. We 
      report in this study the clinical and genetic features of a new Moroccan family 
      of SCA7, from the South of Morocco. We performed the molecular genetic testing to 
      confirm the diagnosis of SCA7. The objective of this study is to report a new 
      Moroccan case of SCA7 and to illustrate the role of the geneticist in the 
      diagnosis, management and development of genetic counseling of SCA7 disease.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by a polyglutamine repeat expansion in the ATXN7 gene. Patients with this 
      disease suffer from a degeneration of their cerebellar Purkinje neurons and 
      retinal photoreceptors that result in a progressive ataxia and loss of vision. As 
      with many neurodegenerative diseases, studies of pathogenesis have been hindered 
      by a lack of disease-relevant models. To this end, we have generated induced 
      pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a cohort of SCA7 patients in South Africa. 
      First, we differentiated the SCA7 affected iPSCs into neurons which showed 
      evidence of a transcriptional phenotype affecting components of STAGA (ATXN7 and 
      KAT2A) and the heat shock protein pathway (DNAJA1 and HSP70). We then performed 
      electrophysiology on the SCA7 iPSC-derived neurons and found that these cells 
      show features of functional aberrations. Lastly, we were able to differentiate 
      the SCA7 iPSCs into retinal photoreceptors that also showed similar 
      transcriptional aberrations to the SCA7 neurons. Our findings give technical 
      insights on how iPSC-derived neurons and photoreceptors can be derived from SCA7 
      patients and demonstrate that these cells express molecular and 
      electrophysiological differences that may be indicative of impaired neuronal 
      health. We hope that these findings will contribute towards the ongoing efforts 
      to establish the cell-derived models of neurodegenerative diseases that are 
      needed to develop patient-specific treatments.

      Type 7.

LID - 390
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7), a neurodegenerative disease characterized 
      by cerebellar ataxia and retinal degeneration, is caused by an abnormal CAG 
      repeat expansion in the ATXN7 gene coding region. The onset and severity of SCA7 
      are highly variable between patients, thus identification of sensitive biomarkers 
      that accurately diagnose the disease and monitoring its progression are needed. 
      With the aim of identified SCA7-specific metabolites with clinical relevance, we 
      report for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, a metabolomics profiling 
      of circulating acylcarnitines and amino acids in SCA7 patients. We identified 21 
      metabolites with altered levels in SCA7 patients and determined two different 
      sets of metabolites with diagnostic power. The first signature of metabolites 
      (Valine, Leucine, and Tyrosine) has the ability to discriminate between SCA7 
      patients and healthy controls, while the second one (Methionine, 
      3-hydroxytetradecanoyl-carnitine, and 3-hydroxyoctadecanoyl-carnitine) possess 
      the capability to differentiate between early-onset and adult-onset patients, as 
      shown by the multivariate model and ROC analyses. Furthermore, enrichment 
      analyses of metabolic pathways suggest alterations in mitochondrial function, 
      energy metabolism, and fatty acid beta-oxidation in SCA7 patients. In summary, 
      circulating SCA7-specific metabolites identified in this study could serve as 
      effective predictors of SCA7 progression in the clinics, as they are sampled in 
      accessible biofluid and assessed by a relatively simple biochemical assay.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since different types of genetic variants, from single nucleotide 
      variants (SNVs) to large chromosomal rearrangements, underlie intellectual 
      disability, we evaluated the use of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) rather than 
      chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) as a first-line genetic diagnostic test. 
      METHODS: We analyzed three cohorts with short-read WGS: (i) a retrospective 
      cohort with validated copy number variants (CNVs) (cohort 1, n = 68), (ii) 
      individuals referred for monogenic multi-gene panels (cohort 2, n = 156), and 
      (iii) 100 prospective, consecutive cases referred to our center for CMA (cohort 
      3). Bioinformatic tools developed include FindSV, SVDB, Rhocall, Rhoviz, and 
      vcf2cytosure. RESULTS: First, we validated our structural variant (SV)-calling 
      pipeline on cohort 1, consisting of three trisomies and 79 deletions and 
      duplications with a median size of 850 kb (min 500 bp, max 155 Mb). All variants 
      were detected. Second, we utilized the same pipeline in cohort 2 and analyzed 
      with monogenic WGS panels, increasing the diagnostic yield to 8%. Next, cohort 3 
      was analyzed by both CMA and WGS. The WGS data was processed for large (> 10 kb) 
      SVs genome-wide and for exonic SVs and SNVs in a panel of 887 genes linked to 
      intellectual disability as well as genes matched to patient-specific Human 
      Phenotype Ontology (HPO) phenotypes. This yielded a total of 25 pathogenic 
      variants (SNVs or SVs), of which 12 were detected by CMA as well. We also applied 
      short tandem repeat (STR) expansion detection and discovered one pathologic 
      expansion in ATXN7. Finally, a case of Prader-Willi syndrome with uniparental 
      disomy (UPD) was validated in the WGS data. Important positional information was 
      obtained in all cohorts. Remarkably, 7% of the analyzed cases harbored complex 
      structural variants, as exemplified by a ring chromosome and two duplications 
      found to be an insertional translocation and part of a cryptic unbalanced 
      translocation, respectively. CONCLUSION: The overall diagnostic rate of 27% was 
      more than doubled compared to clinical microarray (12%). Using WGS, we detected a 
      wide range of SVs with high accuracy. Since the WGS data also allowed for 
      analysis of SNVs, UPD, and STRs, it represents a powerful comprehensive genetic 
      test in a clinical diagnostic laboratory setting.

AB  - Although the heritability of cognitive function in old age is substantial, 
      genome-wide association studies have had limited success in elucidating its 
      genetic basis, leaving a considerable amount of "missing heritability." Aside 
      from single nucleotide polymorphisms, genome-wide association studies are unable 
      to assess other large sources of genetic variation, such as tandem repeat 
      polymorphisms. Therefore, here, we studied the association of 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat variations in polyglutamine 
      disease-associated genes (PDAGs) with cognitive function in older adults. In a 
      large cohort consisting of 5786 participants, we found that the CAG repeat number 
      in 3 PDAGs (TBP, HTT, and AR) were significantly associated with the decline in 
      cognitive function, which together accounted for 0.49% of the variation. 
      Furthermore, in an magnetic resonance imaging substudy, we found that CAG repeat 
      polymorphisms in 4 PDAGs (ATXN2, CACNA1A, ATXN7, and AR) were associated with 
      different imaging characteristics, including brain stem, putamen, globus 
      pallidus, thalamus, and amygdala volumes. Our findings indicate that tandem 
      repeat polymorphisms are associated with cognitive function in older adults and 
      highlight the importance of PDAGs in elucidating its missing heritability.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 with RP1L1-negative occult macular dystrophy as 
      retinal manifestation.
PG  - 282-285
LID - 10.1080/13816810.2019.1633548 [doi]
AB  - Background: Spinocerebellar ataxia Type 7 (SCA7) is an autosomal dominant, 
      progressive neurodegenerative disorder, primarily characterized by cerebellar 
      ataxia. The disease is caused by the expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat 
      within the ataxin-7 gene when its CAG repeat sequences are extended beyond 38. 
      The degree of retinopathy can vary from pigment change in the fovea to foveal 
      atrophy and is correlated with the number of CAG repeats. The present study 
      describes a case of SCA7 with a retinal presentation similar to occult macular 
      dystrophy (OMD) which is an inherited macular dystrophy characterized by 
      presenting with a normal fundus and fluorescein angiography but with progressive 
      central visual loss. Materials and Methods: Report of a case. Results: In this 
      case, no specific abnormality was found on fundus examination, fluorescein 
      angiography, full-field electroretinography and infrared autofluorescence. 
      Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography showed foveal thinning, focal 
      disruption of the ellipsoid zone, and central loss of the outer segment-retinal 
      pigment epithelium interdigitation zone that were well matched with the 
      multifocal electroretinography finding. Thirty-nine CAG repeats in ataxin-7 gene 
      were identified through genetic testing. Conclusions: SCA7 can present with a 
      very mild form of retinal degeneration similar to the classic phenotype of 
      RP1L1-negative OMD in case of the lower number of CAG repeats.

TI  - (CAG)(n) loci as genetic modifiers of age at onset in patients with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 from mainland China.
PG  - 1130-1136
LID - 10.1111/ene.13954 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The expanded repeat length in ATXN1 negatively correlates 
      with age at onset (AAO) of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) but can explain 
      only part of it, indicating that other factors affect AAO. Some studies have 
      explored the influence of non-causative CAG repeats on the AAO of SCA patients. 
      However, studies on Chinese SCA1 patients regarding candidate modifier factors 
      involved in the variability in AAO are rare. METHODS: In all, 152 Chinese SCA1 
      patients who were genotyped for ATXN1 and nine other (CAG)(n) -containing genes 
      were enrolled. Regression analysis was performed to determine the effect of the 
      expanded allele of ATXN1 (linear and quadratic effects) on AAO. Then, different 
      models were used to explore the modulatory effect of nine other (CAG)(n) 
      -containing genes. RESULTS: Our results verified the negative effect of the 
      expanded allele in ATXN1 by regression analysis. Some (CAG)(n) -containing genes 
      including TBP, ATN1 and HTT modified AAO with variance ranging from 0.8% to 3.8% 
      and tended to decrease or delay AAO. However, no modifier effects of ATXN2, 
      ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, KCNN3, RAI1 and normal ATXN1 alleles in trans were 
      detected. CONCLUSION: By using interaction analyses, TBP, ATN1 and HTT were 
      determined to have modifying effects. Our study revealed that differences in 
      modulation may be due to ethnic and geographic diversity across different 
      populations. Furthermore, the variability of AAO was not completely explained by 
      the genetic modifiers examined here, suggesting that other genetic or 
      environmental factors are involved in these diseases.

LID - 10.1007/s12035-019-1480-y [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7), a neurodegenerative disease characterized 
      by cerebellar ataxia and retinal degeneration, is caused by a CAG repeat 
      expansion in the ATXN7 gene coding region. Disease onset and progression are 
      highly variable between patients, thus identification of specific/sensitive 
      biomarkers that can improve the monitoring of disease progression is an immediate 
      need. Because altered expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) has been shown 
      in various neurological diseases, they could be useful biomarkers for SCA7. In 
      this study, we showed, to our knowledge for the first time, the expression 
      profile of circulating miRNAs in SCA7. Using the TaqMan profiling low density 
      array (TLDA), we found 71 differentially expressed miRNAs in the plasma of SCA7 
      patients, compared with healthy controls. The reliability of TLDA data was 
      validated independently by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in an 
      independent cohort of patients and controls. We identified four validated miRNAs 
      that possesses the diagnostic value to discriminate between healthy controls and 
      patients (hsa-let-7a-5p, hsa-let7e-5p, hsa-miR-18a-5p, and hsa-miR-30b-5p). The 
      target genes of these four miRNAs were significantly enriched in cellular 
      processes that are relevant to central nervous system function, including 
      Fas-mediated cell-death, heparansulfate biosynthesis, and 
      soluble-N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor activating protein receptor pathways. 
      Finally, we identify a signature of four miRNAs associated with disease severity 
      that discriminate between early onset and adult onset, highlighting their 
      potential utility to surveillance disease progression. In summary, circulating 
      miRNAs might provide accessible biomarkers for disease stage and progression and 
      help to identify novel cellular processes involved in SCA7.

      Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 7 as a Mitochondrial Disease.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a retinal-cerebellar degenerative 
      disorder caused by CAG-polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansions in the ataxin-7 
      gene. As many SCA7 clinical phenotypes occur in mitochondrial disorders, and 
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy of patients revealed altered energy metabolism, 
      we considered a role for mitochondrial dysfunction. Studies of SCA7 mice 
      uncovered marked impairments in oxygen consumption and respiratory exchange. When 
      we examined cerebellar Purkinje cells in mice, we observed mitochondrial network 
      abnormalities, with enlarged mitochondria upon ultrastructural analysis. We 
      developed stem cell models from patients and created stem cell knockout rescue 
      systems, documenting mitochondrial morphology defects, impaired oxidative 
      metabolism, and reduced expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) 
      production enzymes in SCA7 models. We observed NAD(+) reductions in mitochondria 
      of SCA7 patient NPCs using ratiometric fluorescent sensors and documented 
      alterations in tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism in patients. Our results indicate 
      that mitochondrial dysfunction, stemming from decreased NAD(+), is a defining 
      feature of SCA7.

TI  - Large normal alleles of ATXN2 decrease age at onset in transthyretin familial 
      amyloid polyneuropathy Val30Met patients.
PG  - 251-258
LID - 10.1002/ana.25409 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Transthyretin (TTR)-related familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) is 
      an autosomal dominant neurological disease, caused most frequently by a Val30Met 
      (now classified as Val50Met) substitution in TTR. Age at onset (AO) ranges from 
      19 to 82 years, and variability exists mostly between generations. Unstable 
      oligonucleotide repeats in various genes are the mechanism behind several 
      neurological diseases, found also to act as modifiers for other disorders. Our 
      aim was to investigate whether large normal repeat alleles of 10 genes had a 
      possible modifier effect in AO in Portuguese TTR-FAP Val30Met families. METHODS: 
      We analyzed 329 Portuguese patients from 123 families. Repeat length (at ATXN1, 
      ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, TBP, ATN1, HTT, JPH3, AR, and DMPK) was assessed by single 
      and multiplex polymerase chain reaction, using fluorescently labeled primers, 
      followed by capillary electrophoresis. We used a family-centered approach, and 
      generalized estimating equations were used to account for AO correlation between 
      family members. RESULTS: For ATXN2, the presence of at least 1 allele longer than 
      22 CAGs was significantly associated with an earlier onset in TTR-FAP Val30Met, 
      decreasing mean AO by 6 years (95% confidence interval = -8.81 to -2.19, p = 
      0.001). No association was found for the remaining repeat loci. INTERPRETATION: 
      Length of normal repeats at ATXN2 may modify AO in TTR-FAP Val30Met and may 
      function as a risk factor. This can be due to the role of ATXN2 in RNA metabolism 
      and as a modulator of various cellular processes, including mitochondrial stress. 
      This may have relevant implications for prognosis and the follow-up of 
      presymptomatic carriers. ANN NEUROL 2019;85:251-258.

TI  - Antisense oligonucleotides targeting mutant Ataxin-7 restore visual function in a 
      mouse model of spinocerebellar ataxia type 7.
LID - 10.1126/scitranslmed.aap8677 [doi]
LID - eaap8677
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disorder characterized by cerebellar and retinal degeneration, and is caused by a 
      CAG-polyglutamine repeat expansion in the ATAXIN-7 gene. Patients with SCA7 
      develop progressive cone-rod dystrophy, typically resulting in blindness. 
      Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are single-stranded chemically modified nucleic 
      acids designed to mediate the destruction, prevent the translation, or modify the 
      processing of targeted RNAs. Here, we evaluated ASOs as treatments for SCA7 
      retinal degeneration in representative mouse models of the disease after 
      injection into the vitreous humor of the eye. Using Ataxin-7 aggregation, visual 
      function, retinal histopathology, gene expression, and epigenetic dysregulation 
      as outcome measures, we found that ASO-mediated Ataxin-7 knockdown yielded 
      improvements in treated SCA7 mice. In SCA7 mice with retinal disease, 
      intravitreal injection of Ataxin-7 ASOs also improved visual function despite 
      initiating treatment after symptom onset. Using color fundus photography and 
      autofluorescence imaging, we also determined the nature of retinal degeneration 
      in human SCA7 patients. We observed variable disease severity and cataloged 
      rapidly progressive retinal degeneration. Given the accessibility of neural 
      retina, availability of objective, quantitative readouts for monitoring 
      therapeutic response, and the rapid disease progression in SCA7, ASOs targeting 
      ATAXIN-7 might represent a viable treatment for SCA7 retinal degeneration.

AB  - Genomewide association studies (GWASs) have contributed greatly to unraveling the 
      genetic basis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, a large amount of "missing 
      heritability" remains. In this exploratory study, we investigated the effect of 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeats in polyglutamine disease-associated genes 
      (PDAGs) on the risk of AD and its expression. In a cohort of 959 patients 
      diagnosed with AD (Amsterdam Dementia cohort) and 4106 cognitively healthy 
      participants (Leiden 85-plus Study and the Prospective Study of Pravastatin in 
      the Elderly at Risk), we determined the CAG repeat sequences in ATXN1, ATXN2, 
      ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, HTT, ATN1, and AR. We did not find a significant 
      association between the risk of AD and variations in CAG repeat numbers of PDAGs. 
      However, we found that differences in CAG repeat numbers in ATXN1, ATXN2, and AR 
      were significantly associated with several clinical and imaging features in AD 
      patients. Specifically, the association between memory performance in patients 
      with AD and the CAG repeat size in the longer ATXN1 allele, and the association 
      between atrophy in the medial temporal lobes and the CAG repeat number in the 
      longer AR allele remained significant after correction for multiple testing. Our 
      findings suggest that repeat polymorphisms in ATXN1 and AR can act as important 
      genetic modifiers of AD, warranting further scrutiny of their role in its missing 
      heritability and pathogenesis.

TI  - Motor and cognitive impairments in spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 and its 
      correlations with cortical volumes.
PG  - 3199-3211
LID - 10.1111/ejn.14148 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 7 (SCA7) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat expansion. It is clinically characterized 
      by ataxia and visual loss. To date, little is known about SCA7 cognitive 
      impairments and its relationship with grey matter volume (GMV) changes. The aim 
      of this study was to explore SCA7 patients' performance in specific components of 
      auditory-verbal neuropsychological tests and to correlate their scores with 
      genetic mutation, severity of ataxia and GMV. We assessed verbal memory and 
      verbal fluency proficiencies in 31 genetically confirmed SCA7 patients, and 
      compared their results with 32 healthy matched volunteers; we also correlated CAG 
      repeats and severity of motor symptoms with performance in the auditory-verbal 
      tests. SCA7 patients exhibited deficiencies in several components of these 
      cognitive tasks, which were independent of motor impairments and showed no 
      relation to CAG repeats. Based on Resonance Images performed in 27 patients we 
      found association between ataxia severity and GMV in "sensoriomotor" cerebellum, 
      as well as correlations of impaired verbal memory and semantic fluency scores 
      with GMV in association cortices, including the right parahippocampal gyrus. To 
      our knowledge, this is the first report of deficits in the organization of 
      semantic information and in the evocation of verbal material, as well as greater 
      susceptibility to proactive interference in SCA7 patients. These findings bring 
      novel information about specific cognitive abilities in SCA7 patients, 
      particularly verbal memory and fluency, and their relation with GMV variations in 
      circumscribed brain regions, including association cortices known to have 
      functional relationships with the cerebellum.

      mass index.
PG  - 440-449
LID - 10.1038/s41366-018-0161-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The worldwide prevalence of obesity, a major risk factor for numerous 
      debilitating chronic disorders, is increasing rapidly. Although a substantial 
      amount of the variation in body mass index (BMI) is estimated to be heritable, 
      the largest meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to date 
      explained only ~2.7% of the variation. To tackle this 'missing heritability' 
      problem of obesity, here we focused on the contribution of DNA repeat length 
      polymorphisms which are not detectable by GWAS. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We 
      determined the cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat length in the nine known 
      polyglutamine disease-associated genes (ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, 
      HTT, ATN1 and AR) in two large cohorts consisting of 12,457 individuals and 
      analyzed their association with BMI, using generalized linear mixed-effect 
      models. RESULTS: We found a significant association between BMI and the length of 
      CAG repeats in seven polyglutamine disease-associated genes (including ATXN1, 
      ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP and AR). Importantly, these repeat variations 
      could account for 0.75% of the total BMI variation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings 
      incriminate repeat polymorphisms as an important novel class of genetic risk 
      factors of obesity and highlight the role of the brain in its pathophysiology.

AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, characterised 
      by a triad of movement disorder, emotional and behavioural disturbances and 
      cognitive impairment. The underlying cause is an expanded CAG repeat in the 
      huntingtin gene. For a small proportion of patients presenting with HD-like 
      symptoms, the mutation in this gene is not identified and they are said to have a 
      HD "phenocopy". South Africa has the highest number of recorded cases of an 
      African-specific phenocopy, Huntington disease-like 2 (HDL2), caused by a repeat 
      expansion in the junctophilin-3 gene. However, a significant proportion of black 
      patients with clinical symptoms suggestive of HD still test negative for HD and 
      HDL2. This study thus aimed to investigate five other loci associated with HD 
      phenocopy syndromes - ATN1, ATXN2, ATXN7, TBP and C9orf72. In a sample of 
      patients in whom HD and HDL2 had been excluded, a single expansion was identified 
      in the ATXN2 gene, confirming a diagnosis of Spinocerebellar ataxia 2. The 
      results indicate that common repeat expansion disorders do not contribute 
      significantly to the HD-like phenotype in black South African patients. 
      Importantly, allele sizing reveals unique distributions of normal repeat lengths 
      across the associated loci in the African population studied.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7, associated with a (CAG)(n) 
      repeat expansion in coding sequences, are the most prevalent autosomal dominant 
      ataxias worldwide (approximately 60% of the cases). In addition, the phenotype of 
      SCA2 expansions has been now extended to Parkinson disease and amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis. Their diagnosis is currently based on a PCR to identify small 
      expanded alleles, followed by a second-level test whenever a false normal 
      homozygous or a CAT interruption in SCA1 needs to be verified. Next-generation 
      sequencing still does not allow efficient detection of these repeats. Here, we 
      show the efficacy of a novel, rapid, and cost-effective method to identify and 
      size pathogenic expansions in SCA1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 and recognize large alleles or 
      interruptions without a second-level test. Twenty-five healthy controls and 33 
      expansion carriers were analyzed: alleles migrated consistently in different PCRs 
      and capillary runs, and homozygous individuals were always distinguishable from 
      heterozygous carriers of both common and large (>100 repeats) pathogenic CAG 
      expansions. Repeat number could be calculated counting the number of peaks, 
      except for the largest SCA2 and SCA7 alleles. Interruptions in SCA1 were always 
      visible. Overall, our method allows a simpler, cost-effective, and sensibly 
      faster SCA diagnostic protocol compared with the standard technique and to the 
      still unadapted next-generation sequencing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) subtypes are often caused by expansions 
      in non-coding regions of genes like SCA8, SCA10, SCA12 and SCA36. Other ataxias 
      are known to be associated with repeat expansions such as fragile X-associated 
      tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) or expansions in the C9orf72 gene. When no 
      mutation has been identified in the aforementioned genes next-generation 
      sequencing (NGS)-based diagnostics may also be applied. In order to define an 
      optimal diagnostic strategy, more information about the frequency and phenotypic 
      characteristics of rare repeat expansion disorders associated with ataxia should 
      be at hand. METHODS: We analyzed a consecutive cohort of 440 German unrelated 
      patients with symptoms of cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria and other unspecific 
      symptoms who were referred to our center for SCA diagnostics. They showed alleles 
      in the normal range for the most common SCA subtypes SCA1-3, SCA6, SCA7 and 
      SCA17. These patients were screened for expansions causing SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, 
      SCA36 and FXTAS as well as for the pathogenic hexanucleotide repeat in the 
      C9orf72 gene. RESULTS: Expanded repeats for SCA10, SCA12 or SCA36 were not 
      identified in the analyzed patients. Five patients showed expanded SCA8 CTA/CTG 
      alleles with 92-129 repeats. One 51-year-old male with unclear dementia symptoms 
      was diagnosed with a large GGGGCC repeat expansion in C9orf72. The analysis of 
      the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1) revealed one patient with a 
      premutation (>50 CGG repeats) and seven patients with alleles in the grey zone 
      (41 to 54 CGG repeats). CONCLUSIONS: Altogether five patients showed 92 or more 
      SCA8 CTA/CTG combined repeats. Our results support the assumption that smaller 
      FMR1 gene expansions could be associated with the risk of developing neurological 
      signs. The results do not support genetic testing for C9orf72 expansion in ataxia 
      patients.

AB  - Cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat expansions in the coding regions of nine 
      polyglutamine (polyQ) genes (HTT, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, ATN1, AR, 
      and TBP) are the cause of several neurodegenerative diseases including 
      Huntington's disease (HD), six different spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, and spinobulbar muscular atrophy. The 
      expanded CAG repeat length in the causative gene is negatively related to the 
      age-at-onset (AAO) of clinical symptoms. In addition to the expanded CAG repeat 
      length in the causative gene, the normal CAG repeats in the other polyQ genes can 
      affect the AAO, suggesting functional interactions between the polyQ genes. 
      However, there is no detailed assessment of the relationships among polyQ genes 
      in pathologically relevant brain regions. We used gene co-expression analysis to 
      study the functional relationships among polyQ genes in different brain regions 
      using the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA), a spatial map of gene expression in the 
      healthy brain. We constructed co-expression networks for seven anatomical brain 
      structures, as well as a region showing a specific pattern of atrophy in HD 
      patients detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. In this 
      HD-associated region, we found that ATN1 and ATXN2 were co-expressed and shared 
      co-expression partners which were enriched for DNA repair genes. We observed a 
      similar co-expression pattern in the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, and striatum in 
      which this relation was most pronounced. Given that the co-expression patterns 
      for these anatomical structures were similar to those for the HD-associated 
      region, our results suggest that their disruption is likely involved in HD 
      pathology. Moreover, ATN1 and ATXN2 also shared many co-expressed genes with HTT, 
      the causative gene of HD, across the brain. Although this triangular relationship 
      among these three polyQ genes may also be dysregulated in other polyQ diseases, 
      stronger co-expression patterns between ATN1 and ATXN2 observed in the 
      HD-associated region, especially in the striatum, may be more specific to HD.

AB  - Progressive cerebellar ataxias are well-known hereditary neurological disorders. 
      Among them, spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is inherited as an autosomal 
      dominant trait and is ascribed to the expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat 
      within the ATXN7 gene. An anticipation phenomenon can occur during paternal 
      transmission and sometimes is responsible for a severe infantile form. The 
      specificity of SCA7 is the retinal involvement with retinitis pigmentosa and cone 
      rod dystrophy. We describe a familial form with two siblings who died of a severe 
      infantile form. Diagnosis was made in their father, who had a recent history of 
      macular atrophy and presented with gait disturbance thereafter. Retrospectively, 
      substantial triplet repeat expansion was confirmed in the two affected infants. 
      These infantile forms are rare and difficult to diagnose in the absence of 
      suggestive family symptoms.

TI  - A Complete Association of an intronic SNP rs6798742 with Origin of 
      Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 7-CAG Expansion Loci in the Indian and Mexican 
      Population.
PG  - 197-204
LID - 10.1111/ahg.12200 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a rare neurogenetic disorder caused by 
      highly unstable CAG repeat expansion mutation in coding region of SCA7. We aimed 
      to understand the effect of diverse ATXN7 cis-element in correlation with CAG 
      expansion mutation of SCA7. We initially performed an analysis to identify the 
      haplotype background of CAG expanded alleles using eight bi-allelic single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) flanking an ATXN7-CAG expansion in 32 individuals 
      from nine unrelated Indian SCA7 families and 88 healthy controls. Subsequent 
      validation of the findings was performed in 89 ATXN7-CAG mutation carriers and in 
      119 unrelated healthy controls of Mexican ancestry. The haplotype analyses showed 
      a shared haplotype background and C allele of SNP rs6798742 (approximately 6 kb 
      from the 3'-end of CAG repeats) is in complete association with expanded, 
      premutation, intermediate, and the majority of large normal (>/=12) CAG allele. The 
      C allele (ancestral/chimp allele) association was validated in SCA7 subjects and 
      healthy controls from Mexico, suggesting its substantial association with CAG 
      expanded and expansion-prone chromosomes. Analysis of rs6798742 and other 
      neighboring functional SNPs within 6 kb in experimental datasets (Encyclopedia of 
      DNA Elements; ENCODE) shows functional marks that could affect transcription as 
      well as histone methylation. An allelic association of the CAG region to an 
      intronic SNP in two different ethnic and geographical populations suggests a -cis 
      factor-dependent mechanism in ATXN7 CAG-region expansion.

TI  - Large normal-range TBP and ATXN7 CAG repeat lengths are associated with increased 
      lifetime risk of depression.
PG  - e1143
LID - 10.1038/tp.2017.116 [doi]
AB  - Depression is one of the most prevalent and debilitating psychiatric disorders 
      worldwide. Recently, we showed that both relatively short and relatively long 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeats in the huntingtin gene (HTT) are 
      associated with an increased risk of lifetime depression. However, to what extent 
      the variations in CAG repeat length in the other eight polyglutamine 
      disease-associated genes (PDAGs) are associated with depression is still unknown. 
      We determined the CAG repeat sizes of ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, 
      ATN1 and AR in two well-characterized Dutch cohorts-the Netherlands Study of 
      Depression and Anxiety and the Netherlands Study of Depression in Older 
      Persons-including 2165 depressed and 1058 non-depressed individuals-aged 18-93 
      years. The association between PDAG CAG repeat size and the risk for depression 
      was assessed via binary logistic regression. We found that the odds ratio (OR) 
      for lifetime depression was significantly higher for individuals with >10, 
      compared with subjects with </=10, CAG repeats in both ATXN7 alleles (OR=1.90, 
      confidence interval (CI) 1.26-2.85). For TBP we found a similar association: A 
      CAG repeat length exceeding the median in both alleles was associated with an 
      increased risk for lifetime depression (OR=1.33, CI 1.00-1.76). In conclusion, we 
      observed that carriers of either ATXN7 or TBP alleles with relatively large CAG 
      repeat sizes in both alleles had a substantially increased risk of lifetime 
      depression. Our findings provide critical evidence for the notion that repeat 
      polymorphisms can act as complex genetic modifiers of depression.

TI  - The replicative lifespan-extending deletion of SGF73 results in altered ribosomal 
      gene expression in yeast.
PG  - 785-796
LID - 10.1111/acel.12611 [doi]
AB  - Sgf73, a core component of SAGA, is the yeast orthologue of ataxin-7, which 
      undergoes CAG-polyglutamine repeat expansion leading to the human 
      neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7). Deletion of SGF73 
      dramatically extends replicative lifespan (RLS) in yeast. To further define the 
      basis for Sgf73-mediated RLS extension, we performed ChIP-Seq, identified 388 
      unique genomic regions occupied by Sgf73, and noted enrichment in promoters of 
      ribosomal protein (RP)-encoding genes. Of 388 Sgf73 binding sites, 33 correspond 
      to 5' regions of genes implicated in RLS extension, including 20 genes encoding 
      RPs. Furthermore, half of Sgf73-occupied, RLS-linked RP genes displayed 
      significantly reduced expression in sgf73Delta mutants, and double null strains 
      lacking SGF73 and a Sgf73-regulated, RLS-linked RP gene exhibited no further 
      increase in replicative lifespan. We also found that sgf73Delta mutants display 
      altered acetylation of Ifh1, an important regulator of RP gene transcription. 
      These findings implicate altered ribosomal protein expression in sgf73Delta yeast RLS 
      and highlight altered acetylation as a pathway of relevance for SCA7 
      neurodegeneration.

TI  - A panel study on patients with dominant cerebellar ataxia highlights the 
      frequency of channelopathies.
PG  - 1579-1594
LID - 10.1093/brain/awx081 [doi]
AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias have a marked heterogeneous genetic 
      background, with mutations in 34 genes identified so far. This large amount of 
      implicated genes accounts for heterogeneous clinical presentations, making 
      genotype-phenotype correlations a major challenge in the field. While 
      polyglutamine ataxias, linked to CAG repeat expansions in genes such as ATXN1, 
      ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, CACNA1A and TBP, have been extensively characterized in 
      large cohorts, there is a need for comprehensive assessment of frequency and 
      phenotype of more 'conventional' ataxias. After exclusion of CAG/polyglutamine 
      expansions in spinocerebellar ataxia genes in 412 index cases with dominantly 
      inherited cerebellar ataxias, we aimed to establish the relative frequencies of 
      mutations in other genes, with an approach combining panel sequencing and TaqMan(R) 
      polymerase chain reaction assay. We found relevant genetic variants in 59 
      patients (14.3%). The most frequently mutated were channel genes [CACNA1A (n = 
      16), KCND3 (n = 4), KCNC3 (n = 2) and KCNA1 (n = 2)]. Deletions in ITPR1 (n = 11) 
      were followed by biallelic variants in SPG7 (n = 9). Variants in AFG3L2 (n = 7) 
      came next in frequency, and variants were rarely found in STBN2 (n = 2), ELOVL5, 
      FGF14, STUB1 and TTBK2 (n = 1 each). Interestingly, possible risk factor variants 
      were detected in SPG7 and POLG. Clinical comparisons showed that ataxias due to 
      channelopathies had a significantly earlier age at onset with an average of 24.6 
      years, versus 40.9 years for polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias and 
      37.8 years for SPG7-related forms (P = 0.001). In contrast, disease duration was 
      significantly longer in the former (20.5 years versus 9.3 and 13.7, P=0.001), 
      though for similar functional stages, indicating slower progression of the 
      disease. Of interest, intellectual deficiency was more frequent in channel 
      spinocerebellar ataxias, while cognitive impairment in adulthood was similar 
      among the three groups. Similar differences were found among a single gene group, 
      comparing 23 patients with CACNA1A expansions (spinocerebellar ataxia 6) to 22 
      patients with CACNA1A point mutations, which had lower average age at onset (25.2 
      versus 47.3 years) with longer disease duration (18.7 versus 10.9), but lower 
      severity indexes (0.39 versus 0.44), indicating slower progression of the 
      disease. In conclusion, we identified relevant genetic variations in up to 15% of 
      cases after exclusion of polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias, and 
      confirmed CACNA1A and SPG7 as major ataxia genes. We could delineate firm 
      genotype-phenotype correlations that are important for genetic counselling and of 
      possible prognostic value.

TI  - Mutant CAG Repeats Effectively Targeted by RNA Interference in SCA7 Cells.
LID - 10.3390/genes7120132 [doi]
LID - 132
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a human neurodegenerative polyglutamine 
      (polyQ) disease caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the open reading frame of the 
      ATXN7 gene. The allele-selective silencing of mutant transcripts using a 
      repeat-targeting strategy has previously been used for several polyQ diseases. 
      Herein, we demonstrate that the selective targeting of a repeat tract in a mutant 
      ATXN7 transcript by RNA interference is a feasible approach and results in an 
      efficient decrease of mutant ataxin-7 protein in patient-derived cells. 
      Oligonucleotides (ONs) containing specific base substitutions cause the 
      downregulation of the ATXN7 mutant allele together with the upregulation of its 
      normal allele. The A2 ON shows high allele selectivity at a broad range of 
      concentrations and also restores UCHL1 expression, which is downregulated in 
      SCA7.

TI  - Regulation of mRNA Translation by MID1: A Common Mechanism of Expanded CAG Repeat 
      RNAs.
PG  - 226
LID - 226
AB  - Expansion of CAG repeats, which code for the disease-causing polyglutamine 
      protein, is a common feature in polyglutamine diseases. RNA-mediated mechanisms 
      that contribute to neuropathology in polyglutamine diseases are important. 
      RNA-toxicity describes a phenomenon by which the mutant CAG repeat RNA recruits 
      RNA-binding proteins, thereby leading to aberrant function. For example the MID1 
      protein binds to mutant huntingtin (HTT) RNA, which is linked to Huntington's 
      disease (HD), at its CAG repeat region and induces protein synthesis of mutant 
      protein. But is this mechanism specific to HD or is it a common mechanism in CAG 
      repeat expansion disorders? To answer this question, we have analyzed the 
      interaction between MID1 and three other CAG repeat mRNAs, Ataxin2 (ATXN2), 
      Ataxin3 (ATXN3), and Ataxin7 (ATXN7), that all differ in the sequence flanking 
      the CAG repeat. We show that ATXN2, ATXN3, and ATXN7 bind to MID1 in a CAG repeat 
      length-dependent manner. Furthermore, we show that functionally, in line with 
      what we have previously observed for HTT, the binding of MID1 to ATXN2, ATXN3, 
      and ATXN7 mRNA induces protein synthesis in a repeat length-dependent manner. Our 
      data suggest that regulation of protein translation by the MID1 complex is a 
      common mechanism for CAG repeat containing mRNAs.

      GENERATIONS.

AB  - PURPOSE: To report a diagnosis of spinocerebellar ataxia Type 7 (SCA-7) first 
      diagnosed in the daughter followed by the father, with proven genetic testing and 
      display of progressive anticipation of disease penetrance. METHODS: A 5-year-old 
      African American female admitted for failure to thrive underwent full ocular 
      examination and fundus photography, with genetic confirmation of SCA-7. The 
      father carried a previous diagnosis of possible solar retinopathy; however, with 
      further genetic testing, he was also found to have SCA-7. RESULTS: The patient 
      was admitted for failure to thrive with suspicion of ataxia neurodegenerative 
      disorder. Visual acuity was hand motion. Fundus examination showed retinal 
      pigment epithelium pigmentary changes in the macula and peripheral retina. 
      Further genetic workup revealed 96 CAG repeat expansion compared with a normal of 
      <20 repeats. Ocular examination of patient's father displayed a milder form of 
      retinopathy with genetic testing showing 47 CAG repeat expansion. Diagnosis of 
      SCA-7 was made displaying genetic anticipation. CONCLUSION: Spinocerebellar 
      ataxia Type 7 is a disease of expanded CAG repeats showing genetic anticipation. 
      Patients display progressive cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria dysphagia, slow 
      saccadic eye movements, and cone photoreceptor loss leading to progressive vision 
      loss. CAG repeat length tends to expand with transmission resulting in dramatic 
      symptoms in offspring sometimes resulting in diagnosis before parents' diagnosis. 
      Awareness of this condition may help in earlier diagnosis and unnecessary testing 
      resulting in more effective counseling for the patient and their family.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The natural history of clinical symptoms in the spinocerebellar 
      ataxias (SCA)s has been well characterised. However there is little longitudinal 
      data comparing cognitive changes in the most common SCA subtypes over time. The 
      present study provides a preliminary longitudinal characterisation of the 
      clinical and cognitive profiles in patients with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 and SCA7, 
      with the aim of elucidating the role of the cerebellum in cognition. METHODS: 13 
      patients with different SCAs all caused by CAG repeat expansion (SCA1, n = 2; 
      SCA2, n = 2; SCA3, n = 2; SCA6, n = 4; and SCA7, n = 3) completed a comprehensive 
      battery of cognitive and mood assessments at two time points, a mean of 
      7.35 years apart. All patients were evaluated clinically using the Scale for the 
      Rating and Assessment of Ataxia (SARA) and the Inventory of Non-Ataxia Signs 
      (INAS). Patients underwent structural MRI imaging at follow-up. RESULTS: Clinical 
      scale scores increased in all patients over time, most prominently in the SCA1 
      (SARA) and SCA3 (INAS) groups. New impairments on neuropsychological tests were 
      most commonly observed with executive functions, speed, attention, visual memory 
      and Theory of Mind. Results suggest possible differences in cognitive decline in 
      SCA subtypes, with the most rapid cognitive decline observed in the SCA1 
      patients, and the least in the SCA6 patients, congruent with observed patterns of 
      motor deterioration. Minimal changes in mood were observed, and MRI measures of 
      atrophy did not correlate with cognitive decline. CONCLUSION: As well as 
      increasing physical impairment, cognitive decline over time appears to be a 
      distinct aspect of the SCA phenotype, in keeping with the cerebellar 
      cognitive-affective syndrome. Our data suggest a trend of cognitive decline that 
      is different for each SCA subtype, and for the majority is related to the 
      severity of cerebellar motor impairment.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type-7 (SCA7) is a cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat 
      polyglutamine disorder characterized by progressive degeneration of the 
      cerebellum, brainstem, spinal cord, and retina. Clinical features include 
      progressive ataxia, visual loss, pyramidal weakness, sensory impairment, and 
      dementia. Among the autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias, SCA7 is relatively 
      common in Scandinavia and South Africa but rare worldwide and is not previously 
      reported in Nigeria. In this study, we describe a family in Katsina State, 
      Northwest Nigeria, with nine individuals across three generations affected by the 
      SCA7 phenotype. Analysis of DNA from proband and two affected relatives revealed 
      39 CAG repeat expansions in one allele of ataxin-7 in each.

TI  - MULTIMODAL IMAGING OF A FAMILY WITH SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA TYPE 7 DEMONSTRATING 
      PHENOTYPIC VARIATION AND PROGRESSION OF RETINAL DEGENERATION.
PG  - 267-72
LID - 10.1097/ICB.0000000000000248 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To report the variability and progression of clinical presentation in 
      three family members with spinocerebellar ataxia Type 7 including early 
      recognizable features on retinal imaging and magnetic resonance imaging. METHODS: 
      Retrospective case series. RESULTS: The proband, Patient 1 (mother) presented at 
      age 26 with light perception vision. Initial examination was significant for 
      optic disc pallor, vascular attenuation, and central macular atrophy. Two years 
      later, her vision declined to no light perception, and fundus examination 
      demonstrated marked progression of macular atrophy and peripheral bone spicule 
      formation. Seven years after the onset of vision loss, neurologic examination 
      demonstrated ataxia, dysarthria, and slowed saccades. Genetic testing of ATXN7 
      identified heterozygous 61-CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion confirming the 
      diagnosis of spinocerebellar ataxia Type 7. Patient 2 (son) presented at age 11 
      with visual acuity of 20/300 bilaterally and decreased color vision. Funduscopic 
      examination was notable for disc pallor, vascular attenuation, and peripheral 
      pigmentary changes. Electroretinography demonstrated diminished rod and cone 
      function, and Goldmann visual field testing revealed paracentral scotoma. Patient 
      3 (daughter) presented at age 14 with visual acuity of 20/50 bilaterally and 
      minimal funduscopic changes. The only significant ophthalmic finding was retinal 
      thinning with atrophy of the outer nuclear layer and subfoveal ellipsoid zone on 
      optical coherence tomography. Early cerebellar volume loss was also noted on 
      magnetic resonance imaging. CONCLUSION: The clinical presentation of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia Type 7 can vary widely even within the same family. In 
      individuals with vision loss and normal fundus examination, careful evaluation of 
      optical coherence tomography and brain magnetic resonance imaging facilitates 
      early diagnosis and genetic testing.

      spinocerebellar ataxia: a Thai multicentre study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: About 50 % of Thai patients with adult-onset spinocerebellar ataxia 
      (SCA) was Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), SCA1, SCA2 and SCA6. The author 
      investigated further on less common SCAs in the patients without any known 
      mutations. METHODS: DNA samples of 82 index patients who were genetically 
      excluded MJD, SCA1, SCA2, SCA6, SCA7 and dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy 
      (DRPLA) were examined. Analysis of SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, SCA17 and SCA19 genes were 
      comprehensively performed. Normal range of trinucleotide repeat expansion sizes 
      of TATA-box-binding protein gene (TBP) were also determined in 374 control 
      subjects. RESULTS: Eight patients carried >/=42 CAG/CAA repeat allele in the TBP 
      consistent with SCA17. The pathological repeat alleles ranged from 42 to 57 
      repeats. All patients had significant degree of cognitive dysfunction. Other 
      non-ataxic phenotypes comprised of parkinsonism, chorea, dystonia and myoclonus. 
      A sporadic patient carried a heterozygous 41-repeat allele developed chronic 
      progressive cerebellar degeneration commenced at the age of 28 years. Whilst, 2 % 
      of the control subjects (8/374) carried the 41-repeat allele. Five of the 
      carriers were re-examined, and revealed that four of them had parkinsonism and/or 
      cognitive impairment without cerebellar signs. Analysis of other types of SCAs 
      was all negative. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study of SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, 
      SCA17 and SCA19 in Thais. SCA17 appears to be an important cause of ataxia in 
      Thailand. Although, the pathological cut-off point of the TBP repeat allele 
      remains unclear, the finding suggests that the 41-repeat may be a pathological 
      allele resulting late-onset or mild phenotype. Apart from ataxia, cognitive 
      impairment and parkinsonism may be clinical presentations in these carriers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the association of repeat expansion size in 10 common 
      degenerative hereditary ataxia genes with essential tremor. These genes were 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)-1 (ATXN1), SCA-2 (ATXN2), SCA-3 (ATXN3), SCA-6 
      (CACNA1A), SCA-7 (ATXN7), SCA-8 (ATXN8OS), SCA-10 (ATXN10), SCA-12 (PPP2R2B), 
      SCA-17 (TBP) and dentatorubral-pallidolysian atrophy (DRPLA) (ATN1). METHODS: 
      Genetic analysis of repeat size in 10 degenerative hereditary ataxia loci was 
      performed in 323 essential tremor patients and 299 controls enrolled at Columbia 
      University. To test for differences in the allele distribution between patients 
      and controls, a CLUMP analysis was performed. RESULTS: None of the essential 
      tremor patients had a repeat expansion in the intermediate or pathogenic range. 
      Significant differences in the distribution of repeats in the 'normal' range for 
      SCA2 and SCA8 (both p </= 0.02) were observed between essential tremor patients and 
      controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that pathogenic repeat expansions in 
      SCA loci are not associated with essential tremor.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 7 (SCA7) in Indian population: predilection of ATXN7-CAG 
      expansion mutation in an ethnic population.
PG  - 187-98
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Spinocerebellar ataxia 7 (SCA7) is a rare form of 
      neurodegenerative disorder with the clinical manifestation of cerebellar ataxia 
      and retinal degeneration. In this study we describe the clinico-genetic 
      characteristics of nine SCA7 families of Indian origin and cross compare these 
      with other available worldwide studies. METHODS: Thirty five individuals from 
      nine SCA7 families were clinico-genetically characterized and CAG repeat 
      distribution analysis was carried out in 382 control DNA samples from healthy 
      controls (derived from 21 diverse Indian populations based on ethnic and 
      linguistic and geographical location). RESULTS: Of the nine families studied, 22 
      affected individuals and one asymptomatic carrier were identified. The average 
      age at disease onset was 23.4+/-12.6 yr. The length of expanded CAG ranged from 
      40-94 with mean value of 53.2+/-13.9. The main clinical findings in affecteds 
      individuals included cerebellar ataxia, and retinal degeneration along with 
      hyper-reflexia (95%), slow saccades (85%) and spasticity (45%). Analysis of the 
      association of number of CAG repeats with disease onset revealed that <49 repeats 
      were associated with earlier age at onset in South East Asians compared to 
      European populations. Further analysis of CAG repeats from 21 diverse Indian 
      populations showed pre-mutable repeats (28-34) alleles in the IE-N-LP2 
      population. Six of the nine families identified in this study belonged to the 
      same ethnic population. INTERPRETATIONS & CONCLUSION: Our results show that 
      presenece of SCA7 is relatively rare and confined to one ethnic group from 
      Haryana region of India. We observed a homogeneous phenotypic expression of SCA7 
      mutation as described earlier and an earlier age of onset in our patients with 
      CAG <49. The identification of pre-mutable allele in IE-N-LP2 suggests this 
      population to be at the risk of SCA7.

TI  - Poly(Q) Expansions in ATXN7 Affect Solubility but Not Activity of the SAGA 
      Deubiquitinating Module.
PG  - 1777-87
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01454-14 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by expansion of a polyglutamine [poly(Q)] tract in ATXN7, a subunit of the 
      deubiquitinase (DUB) module (DUBm) in the SAGA complex. The effects of 
      ATXN7-poly(Q) on DUB activity are not known. To address this important question, 
      we reconstituted the DUBm in vitro with either wild-type ATXN7 or a pathogenic 
      form, ATXN7-92Q NT, with 92 Q residues at the N terminus (NT). We found that both 
      forms of ATXN7 greatly enhance DUB activity but that ATXN7-92Q NT is largely 
      insoluble unless it is incorporated into the DUBm. Cooverexpression of DUBm 
      components in human astrocytes also promoted the solubility of ATXN7-92Q, 
      inhibiting its aggregation into nuclear inclusions that sequester DUBm 
      components, leading to global increases in ubiquitinated H2B (H2Bub) levels. 
      Global H2Bub levels were also increased in the cerebellums of mice in a SCA7 
      mouse model. Our findings indicate that although ATXN7 poly(Q) expansions do not 
      change the enzymatic activity of the DUBm, they likely contribute to SCA7 by 
      initiating aggregates that sequester the DUBm away from its substrates.

TI  - Somatic instability of expanded CAG repeats of ATXN7 in Japanese patients with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 7.
PG  - 189-95
LID - 10.1007/s10633-015-9488-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a disease characterized by 
      progressive ataxia syndrome and retinal degeneration. SCA7 is caused by expansion 
      of CAG repeats in the ataxin 7 gene. The purpose of this study was to describe 
      the clinical and genetic features in a two-generation Japanese family with SCA7. 
      METHODS: The female proband underwent systemic examinations that included 
      neurological and ophthalmic examinations and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
      scans. We interviewed her affected mother about the clinical history at the 
      bedside. Genomic DNA was purified from peripheral blood lymphocytes. The number 
      of CAG repeats in the proband, and her affected mother was determined by a 
      polymerase chain reaction-based assay that used the GeneScan analysis software. 
      RESULTS: Neurological examinations showed limb ataxia, truncal ataxia, explosive 
      speech, and hyperactive deep tendon reflexes. The MRI scans showed atrophy of the 
      cerebellum and fundus of pons and tegmentum. Ophthalmologically, loss of visual 
      acuity, macular degenerations, and central scotomas were observed in both eyes. 
      Full-field electroretinography revealed reduced cone responses with preserved rod 
      responses. The mother had hand-motion vision. Genetic analysis revealed that 
      various expanded CAG repeat lengths (43-57) and the peak number of repeats (47 
      and 48) were the same in both patients. CONCLUSIONS: The proband exhibited a 
      typical phenotype of SCA7, which includes cone dystrophy and spinocerebellar 
      ataxia. Genetic analysis demonstrated somatic instability of the CAG repeats in 
      the blood lymphocytes and suggested that there was no genetic anticipation 
      through the maternal transmission.

AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are a group of neurodegenerative disorders 
      characterized by heterogeneous clinical presentation. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      7 (SCA7) is caused by an abnormal CAG repeat expansion and includes cerebellar 
      signs associated with visual loss and ophthalmoplegia. Marked anticipation and 
      dynamic mutation is observed in SCA7. Moreover, phenotype variability and very 
      early onset of symptoms may occur. In this article, a large series of Brazilian 
      patients with different SCA subtypes was evaluated, and we compared the age of 
      onset of SCA7 with other SCA. From the 26 patients with SCA7, 4 manifested their 
      symptoms before 10-year-old. Also, occasionally the parents may have the onset of 
      symptoms after their children. In conclusion, our study highlights the genetic 
      anticipation phenomenon that occurs in SCA7 families. Patients with very early 
      onset ataxia in the context of a remarkable family history, must be considered 
      and tested for SCA7.

      infantile spinocerebellar ataxia type 7.
PG  - 219-23
LID - 10.1001/jamaneurol.2014.1902 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: We report the first case to date of maternally transmitted infantile 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7), in which a tract of (CAG)45 expands to 
      lengths as large as (CAG)92-250. OBSERVATIONS: A 38-year-old woman with classic 
      SCA7 (and a son, who died at age 3 years) had pronounced cerebellar atrophy and a 
      renal biopsy specimen that showed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis with 
      abnormal podocytes containing cytoplasmic inclusions. Polymerase chain reaction 
      amplification across the SCA7 repeat tract assessed expansion levels in tissues 
      of the affected son. High levels of somatic CAG instability were observed in 
      blood, kidney, and skeletal muscle. This transmitted expansion is considerably 
      larger than previously reported maternal transmission expansions of 5 to 10 
      gained repeats. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We document the first intertissue CAG 
      instability reported to date in patients with SCA7, similar to SCA7 mouse models. 
      Infantile SCA7, which is often paternally transmitted, can rarely arise by 
      maternal transmission, which has implications for diagnosis and counseling among 
      families of patients with SCA7.

AB  - Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a clinical and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of debilitating neurodegenerative diseases that are related 
      to at least 36 different genetic loci; they are clinically characterized by 
      progressive cerebellar ataxia and are frequently accompanied by other 
      neurological and non-neurological manifestations. The relative frequency of SCA 
      varies greatly among different regions, presumably because of a founder effect or 
      local ethnicities. Between July 1998 and May 2012, we investigated 320 Brazilian 
      patients with an SCA phenotype who belonged to 150 unrelated families with an 
      autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and 23 sporadic patients from 13 Brazilian 
      states. A total of 265 patients (82.8%) belonging to 131 unrelated families 
      (87.3%) were found to have a definite mutation, and SCA3 accounted for most of 
      the familial cases (70.7%), followed by SCA7 (6%), SCA1 (5.3%), SCA2 (2.7%), SCA6 
      (1.3%), SCA8 (0.7%) and SCA10 (0.7%). In the Ribeirao Preto mesoregion, which is 
      located in the northeast part of Sao Paulo State, the prevalence of SCA3 was 
      approximately 5 per 100,000 inhabitants, which is the highest prevalence found in 
      Brazil. No mutation was found in the SCA12, SCA17 and DRPLA genes, and all the 
      sporadic cases remained without a molecular diagnosis. This study further 
      characterizes the spectrum of SCA mutations found in Brazilian patients, which 
      suggests the existence of regional differences and demonstrates the expansion of 
      the SCA8 locus in Brazilian families.

TI  - Cross-talking noncoding RNAs contribute to cell-specific neurodegeneration in

AB  - What causes the tissue-specific pathology of diseases resulting from mutations in 
      housekeeping genes? Specifically, in spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7), a 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG-repeat expansion in ATXN7 (which 
      encodes an essential component of the mammalian transcription coactivation 
      complex, STAGA), the factors underlying the characteristic progressive cerebellar 
      and retinal degeneration in patients were unknown. We found that STAGA is 
      required for the transcription initiation of miR-124, which in turn mediates the 
      post-transcriptional cross-talk between lnc-SCA7, a conserved long noncoding RNA, 
      and ATXN7 mRNA. In SCA7, mutations in ATXN7 disrupt these regulatory interactions 
      and result in a neuron-specific increase in ATXN7 expression. Strikingly, in mice 
      this increase is most prominent in the SCA7 disease-relevant tissues, namely the 
      retina and cerebellum. Our results illustrate how noncoding RNA-mediated feedback 
      regulation of a ubiquitously expressed housekeeping gene may contribute to 
      specific neurodegeneration.

TI  - Modulation of the age at onset in spinocerebellar ataxia by CAG tracts in various 
      genes.
PG  - 2444-55
LID - 10.1093/brain/awu174 [doi]
AB  - Polyglutamine-coding (CAG)n repeat expansions in seven different genes cause 
      spinocerebellar ataxias. Although the size of the expansion is negatively 
      correlated with age at onset, it accounts for only 50-70% of its variability. To 
      find other factors involved in this variability, we performed a regression 
      analysis in 1255 affected individuals with identified expansions (spinocerebellar 
      ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7), recruited through the European Consortium on 
      Spinocerebellar Ataxias, to determine whether age at onset is influenced by the 
      size of the normal allele in eight causal (CAG)n-containing genes (ATXN1-3, 6-7, 
      17, ATN1 and HTT). We confirmed the negative effect of the expanded allele and 
      detected threshold effects reflected by a quadratic association between age at 
      onset and CAG size in spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 3 and 6. We also evidenced 
      an interaction between the expanded and normal alleles in trans in individuals 
      with spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 6 and 7. Except for individuals with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, age at onset was also influenced by other 
      (CAG)n-containing genes: ATXN7 in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2; ATXN2, ATN1 and 
      HTT in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3; ATXN1 and ATXN3 in spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 6; and ATXN3 and TBP in spinocerebellar ataxia type 7. This suggests that 
      there are biological relationships among these genes. The results were partially 
      replicated in four independent populations representing 460 Caucasians and 216 
      Asian samples; the differences are possibly explained by ethnic or geographical 
      differences. As the variability in age at onset is not completely explained by 
      the effects of the causative and modifier sister genes, other genetic or 
      environmental factors must also play a role in these diseases.

TI  - Allele-specific silencing of mutant Ataxin-7 in SCA7 patient-derived fibroblasts.
PG  - 1369-75
LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2014.39 [doi]
AB  - Polyglutamine (polyQ) disorders are inherited neurodegenerative conditions 
      defined by a common pathogenic CAG repeat expansion leading to a toxic 
      gain-of-function of the mutant protein. Consequences of this toxicity include 
      activation of heat-shock proteins (HSPs), impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome 
      pathway and transcriptional dysregulation. Several studies in animal models have 
      shown that reducing levels of toxic protein using small RNAs would be an ideal 
      therapeutic approach for such disorders, including spinocerebellar ataxia-7 
      (SCA7). However, testing such RNA interference (RNAi) effectors in genetically 
      appropriate patient cell lines with a disease-relevant phenotype has yet to be 
      explored. Here, we have used primary adult dermal fibroblasts from SCA7 patients 
      and controls to assess the endogenous allele-specific silencing of ataxin-7 by 
      two distinct siRNAs. We further identified altered expression of two 
      disease-relevant transcripts in SCA7 patient cells: a twofold increase in levels 
      of the HSP DNAJA1 and a twofold decrease in levels of the de-ubiquitinating 
      enzyme, UCHL1. After siRNA treatment, the expression of both genes was restored 
      towards normal levels. To our knowledge, this is the first time that 
      allele-specific silencing of mutant ataxin-7, targeting a common SNP, has been 
      demonstrated in patient cells. These findings highlight the advantage of an 
      allele-specific RNAi-based therapeutic approach, and indicate the value of 
      primary patient-derived cells as useful models for mechanistic studies and for 
      measuring efficacy of RNAi effectors on a patient-to-patient basis in the polyQ 
      diseases.

AB  - We evaluated the contributions of various polyglutamine (polyQ) disease genes to 
      Parkinson's disease (PD). We compared the distributions of polyQ repeat lengths 
      in 8 common genes (ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, ATN1, and HTT) in 
      299 unrelated patients with autosomal dominant PD (ADPD) and 329 normal controls. 
      We also analyzed the possibility of genetic interactions between ATXN1 and ATXN2, 
      ATXN2 and ATXN3, and ATXN2 and CACNA1A. Intermediate-length polyQ expansions (>24 
      Qs) of ATXN2 were found in 7 ADPD patients and no controls (7/299 = 2.34% and 
      0/329 = 0%, respectively; p = 0.0053 < 0.05/8 after Bonferroni correction). These 
      patients showed typical L-DOPA-responsive PD phenotypes. Conversely, no 
      significant differences in polyQ repeat lengths were found between the ADPD 
      patients and the controls for the other 7 genes. Our results may support the 
      hypothesis that ATXN2 polyQ expansion is a specific predisposing factor for 
      multiple neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Limited data exist on the spectrum of heredoataxias in Greece, including the 
      prevalence and phenotype of Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) and the prevalence and 
      subtypes of dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). We analyzed clinically and 
      investigated genetically for FRDA and triplet-repeat expansion SCAs a consecutive 
      series of 186 patients with suspected heredoataxia referred to Athens over 18 
      years. For prevalence estimates we included patients with molecular diagnosis 
      from Cyprus that were absent from the Athens cohort. The minimum prevalence of 
      FRDA was ~0.9/100,000, with clusters of high prevalence in Aegean islands. FRDA 
      was diagnosed in 73 probands. The genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of FRDA was 
      similar to other populations, with one patient compound heterozygote for a known 
      point mutation in FXN (Asn146Lys). Undiagnosed recessive ataxias included 
      FRDA-like and spastic ataxias. The minimum prevalence of dominant SCAs was 
      ~0.7/100,000. SCA1 (4), SCA7 (4), SCA2, SCA6, and SCA17 (1 each) probands were 
      identified. A molecular diagnosis was reached in 31% of dominant cases. 
      Undiagnosed dominant patients included a majority of type III autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxias. FRDA is the commonest heredoataxia in the Greek population 
      with prevalence towards the lower end of other European populations. Dominant 
      SCAs are almost as prevalent. SCA1, SCA2, SCA6, SCA7 and SCA17 patients complete 
      the spectrum of cases with a specific molecular diagnosis.

TI  - Origin of the spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 gene mutation in Mexican population.
PG  - 902-5
LID - 10.1007/s12311-013-0505-8 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia associated with macular 
      degeneration that leads, in the majority of patients, to loss of autonomy and 
      blindness. The cause of the disease has been identified as (CAG) n repeat 
      expansion in the coding sequence of the ATXN7 gene on chromosome 3p21.1. SCA7 is 
      one of the least common genetically verified autosomal dominant cerebellar 
      ataxias found worldwide; however, we previously identified the Mexican population 
      showing high prevalence of SCA7, suggesting the occurrence of a common founder 
      effect. In this study, haplotype analysis using four SCA7 gene-linked markers 
      revealed that all 72 SCA7 carriers studied share a common haplotype, A-254-82-98, 
      for the intragenic marker 3145G/A and centromeric markers D3S1287, D3S1228, and 
      D3S3635, respectively. This multiloci combination is uncommon in healthy 
      relatives and Mexican general population, suggesting that a single ancestral 
      mutation is responsible for all SCA7 cases in this population. Furthermore, 
      genotyping using 17 short tandem repeat markers from the non-recombining region 
      of the Y chromosome and further phylogenetic relationship analysis revealed that 
      Mexican patients possess the Western European ancestry, which might trace the 
      SCA7 ancestral mutation to that world region.

TI  - Analysis of CAG repeats in five SCA loci in Mexican population: epidemiological 
      evidence of a SCA7 founder effect.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      disorders. CAG (cytosine-adenine-guanine) trinucleotide repeat expansions in the 
      causative genes have been identified as the cause of different SCA. In this 
      study, we simultaneously genotyped SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7 applying a 
      fluorescent multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay. We analyzed 10 families 
      with SCA (64 patients) from five different communities of Veracruz, a Mexican 
      southeastern state, and identified 55 patients for SCA7 and 9 for SCA2, but none 
      for SCA1, SCA3, or SCA6. To our knowledge, this sample represents one of the 
      largest series of SCA7 cases reported worldwide. Genotyping of 300 healthy 
      individuals from Mexican population and compiled data from different ethnicities 
      showed discordant results concerning the hypothesis that SCA disease alleles 
      arise by expansion of large normal alleles.

TI  - Reduction of mutant ataxin-7 expression restores motor function and prevents 
      cerebellar synaptic reorganization in a conditional mouse model of SCA7.
PG  - 890-903
LID - 10.1093/hmg/dds495 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by a CAG - polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansion in the ataxin-7 
      gene. In polyQ disorders, synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration may develop 
      prior to symptom onset. However, conditional expression studies of polyQ disease 
      models demonstrate that suppression of gene expression can yield complete 
      reversal of established behavioral abnormalities. To determine if SCA7 
      neurological and neurodegenerative phenotypes are reversible, we crossed 
      PrP-floxed-SCA7-92Q BAC transgenic mice with a tamoxifen-inducible Cre 
      recombinase transgenic line, CAGGS-Cre-ER. PrP-floxed-SCA7-92Q BAC;CAGGS-Cre-ER 
      bigenic mice were treated with a single dose of tamoxifen 1 month after the onset 
      of detectable ataxia, which resulted in ~50% reduction of polyQ-ataxin-7 
      expression. Tamoxifen treatment halted or reversed SCA7 motor symptoms, reduced 
      ataxin-7 aggregation in Purkinje cells (PCs), and prevented loss of climbing 
      fiber (CF)-PC synapses in comparison to vehicle-treated bigenic animals and 
      tamoxifen-treated PrP-floxed-SCA7-92Q BAC single transgenic mice. Despite this 
      phenotype rescue, reduced ataxin-7 expression did not result in full recovery of 
      cerebellar molecular layer thickness or prevent Bergmann glia degeneration. These 
      results demonstrate that suppression of mutant gene expression by only 50% in a 
      polyQ disease model can have a significant impact on disease phenotypes, even 
      when initiated after the onset of detectable behavioral deficits. The findings 
      reported here are consistent with the emerging view that therapies aimed at 
      reducing neurotoxic gene expression hold the potential to halt or reverse disease 
      progression in afflicted patients, even after the onset of neurological 
      disability.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7: report of a new Italian family.
PG  - 2953-5
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterized by degeneration of the cerebellum, brainstem and retina. We herein 
      describe a family from southern Italy whose proband was a 49-year-old man 
      presenting with ataxia with progressive gait disturbances, clumsiness and visual 
      impairment. A molecular analysis identified 38 cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) 
      repeat expansions within the SCA7 gene. Our study confirms the marked 
      anticipation previously observed in SCA7 and extends the small number of patients 
      studied thus far. In this family, the disease is most likely caused by a de novo 
      expansion of a premutated intermediate allele carried by one parent.

AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) encompass a heterogeneous group of 
      rare diseases that affect the cerebellum and its connections. The most common 
      forms have been associated with dynamic mutations while some rarer forms with 
      conventional mutations. Studies in different populations revealed differences in 
      their relative frequencies both within and between the studied populations, 
      showing that the frequencies are depended on ethnic and geographical factors. 
      Previous investigation of triplet repeat expansion SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, 
      SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, SCA17 and DRPLA) in the Cypriot population, revealed no 
      pathogenic expansion in the Cypriot SCA patients. We hereby present our recent 
      investigation of the SCA10 pentanucleotide repeat expansion. Forty-two 
      ascertained Cypriot sporadic ataxia patients, the index case from 1 ADCA and 14 
      ARCA families and a cohort of normal population individuals were included in the 
      study. All our patients have normal range ATXN10 gene ATTCT repeat numbers 
      (10-19). In the normal population group, repeat lengths ranged from 11 to 20 with 
      the 14 repeats allele being the most frequent. Therefore, all currently 
      established dynamic repeat SCA mutations are absent from the Cypriot population, 
      indicating distinct genetic causes.

TI  - Inherited polyglutamine spinocerebellar ataxias in South Africa.
PG  - 683-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency and distribution of polyglutamine 
      spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) from referrals over a 24-year period to the 
      National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) in South Africa (SA). METHODS: 
      Paper-based clinical reports in the University of Cape Town laboratory and the 
      NHLS electronic patient record database spanning a 24-year period were mined for 
      information regarding the molecular diagnosis, ethnicity and CAG repeat length 
      for individuals referred for molecular genetic testing for the polyglutamine 
      SCAs. RESULTS: SCA1 and 7 are the most frequent types of polyglutamine SCA in the 
      SA patient population, followed by SCA2, 3 and 6. SCA1 is the most common type in 
      the coloured, white and Indian populations, whereas the majority of indigenous 
      black African patients are affected with SCA7 and 2. Of individuals tested, 22% 
      were found to be positive for one of the polyglutamine SCAs. CONCLUSION: Although 
      trends in the frequency and distribution of the polyglutamine SCAs in SA have not 
      changed significantly since our previous study in 2003, they differ remarkably 
      from those reported elsewhere, and reflect the unique genetic and demographic 
      background of SA. The provision of accurate and complete patient information and 
      family history is crucial to the diagnostic process, to enable comprehensive 
      epidemiological studies and assist in developing therapeutic and patient 
      management strategies.

      patients with cerebellar ataxia.

LID - 10.1016/j.jns.2012.03.019 [doi]
AB  - The relative frequency of different autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias, 
      commonly referred to as spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), varies considerably among 
      populations of different ethnic origin. No data exist at present on the frequency 
      of different SCAs in the Greek population. In the present study we investigated 
      the presence of triplet repeat expansion SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, 
      SCA8, SCA12, SCA17 and DRPLA) in a cohort of 83 Greek patients with slowly 
      progressive cerebellar ataxia. Twenty patients came from autosomal dominant (AD) 
      pedigrees, seven displayed recessive or unclear inheritance and 56 were sporadic. 
      We found four patients with pathological SCA expansions, all from AD pedigrees. 
      Two patients had SCA1, one SCA2 and one SCA7 (10.0, 5.0 and 5.0% of the AD group, 
      respectively). The clinical features of these patients were within the expected 
      spectrum. In total, a pathological expansion was detected in 20% of patients from 
      AD pedigrees. Interestingly, no cases of SCA3 or SCA6 were detected in the AD 
      group. No expansions were found in other familial cases or in sporadic patients. 
      Overall, no cases of SCA3, SCA6, SCA12, SCA17 or DRPLA were identified in the 
      Greek population. In conclusion, SCA1, SCA2 and SCA7 are present in Greek 
      patients with AD cerebellar ataxia in frequencies similar to those observed in 
      other populations. SCA3 and SCA6 appear however to be rare in Greece. The genetic 
      cause for the majority of AD ataxias remains to be identified.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 cerebellar disease requires the coordinated action 
      of mutant ataxin-7 in neurons and glia, and displays non-cell-autonomous bergmann 
      glia degeneration.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a dominantly inherited disorder 
      characterized by cerebellum and brainstem neurodegeneration. SCA7 is caused by a 
      CAG/polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansion in the ataxin-7 gene. We previously 
      reported that directed expression of polyQ-ataxin-7 in Bergmann glia (BG) in 
      transgenic mice leads to ataxia and non-cell-autonomous Purkinje cell (PC) 
      degeneration. To further define the cellular basis of SCA7, we derived a 
      conditional inactivation mouse model by inserting a loxP-flanked ataxin-7 cDNA 
      with 92 repeats into the translational start site of the murine prion protein 
      (PrP) gene in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). The PrP-floxed-SCA7-92Q 
      BAC mice developed neurological disease, and exhibited cerebellar degeneration 
      and BG process loss. To inactivate polyQ-ataxin-7 expression in specific 
      cerebellar cell types, we crossed PrP-floxed-SCA7-92Q BAC mice with Gfa2-Cre 
      transgenic mice (to direct Cre to BG) or Pcp2-Cre transgenic mice (which yields 
      Cre in PCs and inferior olive). Excision of ataxin-7 from BG partially rescued 
      the behavioral phenotype, but did not prevent BG process loss or molecular layer 
      thinning, while excision of ataxin-7 from PCs and inferior olive provided 
      significantly greater rescue and prevented both pathological changes, revealing a 
      non-cell-autonomous basis for BG pathology. When we prevented expression of 
      mutant ataxin-7 in BG, PCs, and inferior olive by deriving 
      Gfa2-Cre;Pcp2-Cre;PrP-floxed-SCA7-92Q BAC triple transgenic mice, we noted a 
      dramatic improvement in SCA7 disease phenotypes. These findings indicate that 
      SCA7 disease pathogenesis involves a convergence of alterations in a variety of 
      different cell types to fully recapitulate the cerebellar degeneration.

TI  - Detection of large expansions in SCA8 using a fluorescent repeat-primed PCR 
      assay.
PG  - 63-6
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) is a neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterized by slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia. It is caused by 
      bidirectional expression of (CUG)n expansion in the ATXN80S/ATXN8 gene and (CAG)n 
      expansion transcripts in ATXN8. The diagnosis of SCA8 must be confirmed by the 
      presence of a (CTG)n trinucleotide repeat expansion in the ATXN8OS gene. On the 
      other hand, there are many human genetic diseases that are caused by expansion of 
      short tandem repeats. Since Werner et al proposed a repeat-primed fluorescent PCR 
      to detect large CTG-repeats in myotonic dystrophy, Friedreich ataxia, SCA2, SCA7, 
      SCA10 and SCA12 have been reported. In this study, we applied a fluorescent PCR 
      method for detection of expanded repeats in the ATXN8OS/ATXN8 gene. Although this 
      test cannot give a precise estimate of the size of the expansion, it proved 
      useful for confirming the presence of expansions in SCA8.

PG  - 1071-84
LID - 10.1016/j.neuron.2011.05.027 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by 
      CAG/polyglutamine repeat expansions in the ataxin-7 gene. Ataxin-7 is a component 
      of two different transcription coactivator complexes, and recent work indicates 
      that disease protein normal function is altered in polyglutamine 
      neurodegeneration. Given this, we studied how ataxin-7 gene expression is 
      regulated. The ataxin-7 repeat and translation start site are flanked by binding 
      sites for CTCF, a highly conserved multifunctional transcription regulator. When 
      we analyzed this region, we discovered an adjacent alternative promoter and a 
      convergently transcribed antisense noncoding RNA, SCAANT1. To understand how CTCF 
      regulates ataxin-7 gene expression, we introduced ataxin-7 mini-genes into mice, 
      and found that CTCF is required for SCAANT1 expression. Loss of SCAANT1 
      derepressed ataxin-7 sense transcription in a cis-dependent fashion and was 
      accompanied by chromatin remodeling. Discovery of this pathway underscores the 
      importance of altered epigenetic regulation for disease pathology at repeat loci 
      exhibiting bidirectional transcription.

TI  - Gray and white matter alterations in spinocerebellar ataxia type 7: an in vivo 
      DTI and VBM study.
PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.12.014 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterized by cerebellar ataxia and visual loss. It is caused by a CAG repeat 
      expansion in the gene encoding the ataxin 7 protein. Visual loss is due to a 
      progressive atrophy of photoreceptor cells that results in macular degeneration 
      in more advanced stages. Initial semiautomatic measures in magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI) studies on the brain stem have shown a diminished volume mainly in 
      the cerebellum and pons, while T2 images have shown hyperintensities in 
      transverse fibers at the pons. Neuropathological research, however, has shown 
      more widespread brain damage including loss of myelinated fibers. In this study 
      we decided to take advantage of recent MRI methodological advances to further 
      explore the gray and white matter changes that occur in SCA7 patients. We studied 
      nine genetically confirmed SCA7 patients and their matched controls using voxel 
      based morphometry and tract-based spatial statistics. As expected, we found 
      significant bilateral gray matter volume reductions (p<0.05, corrected for 
      multiple comparisons) in patients' cerebellar cortex. However, we also found 
      significant bilateral gray matter reductions in pre and postcentral gyrus, 
      inferior and medial frontal, parietal inferior, parahippocampal and occipital 
      cortices. The analysis also showed a decrement in fractional anisotropy (p<0.05, 
      corrected) of SCA7 patients in the cerebellum's white matter, brainstem, 
      cerebellar and cerebral peduncles, midbrain, anterior and posterior internal 
      capsule, external/extreme capsule, corpus callosum, corona radiata, optical 
      radiations, and the occipital, temporal and frontal lobe's white matter. These 
      results confirm previous evidence of widespread damage beyond the cerebellum and 
      the pons in SCA7 patients. They also confirmed previous results that had been 
      only detectable through neuropathological analyses and, more importantly, 
      identified new regions affected by the disease that previous methods could not 
      detect. These new results could help explain the symptom's spectrum that affects 
      these patients.

AB  - The diagnosis and incidence of spinocerebelar ataxias (SCA) is sometimes 
      difficult to analyze due the overlap of phenotypes subtypes and are disorders of 
      mutations caused by CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion. To investigate the 
      incidence of the SCA in Southern Brazil, we analyzed the trinucleotide repeats 
      (CAG)n at the SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 and SCA7 loci to identify allele size ranges 
      and frequencies. We examined blood sample from 154 asymptomatic blood donors and 
      115 individuals with progressive ataxias. PCR products were submitted to 
      capillary electrophoresis. In the blood donors, the ranges of the five loci were: 
      SCA1, 19 to 36 (CAG)n; SCA2, 6 to 28 (CAG)n; SCA3, 12 to 34 (CAG)n; SCA6, 2 to 13 
      (CAG)n; and SCA7, 2 to 10 (CAG)n. No deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium 
      were detected. In the ataxia group, we found (CAG)n above the range of the 
      asymptomatic blood donors in SCA3 (21.74%) followed by SCA2 (5.22%), SCA7 
      (2.61%), SCA6 (0.87%), and no cases of SCA1. The remaining 80 cases (69.56%) have 
      different diagnoses from the type here studied. These data defined the alleles 
      and their frequencies, as well as demonstrated their stability in the population 
      not affected. The molecular diagnosis test confirmed the clinical diagnosis in 
      28/45 cases and classified another 7/70 from the clinical unclassified ataxias 
      group.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is a physically devastating, genetically inherited 
      disorder characterized by abnormal brain function that results in the progressive 
      loss of the ability to coordinate movements. There are many types of SCAs as 
      there are various gene mutations that can cause this disease. SCA types 1-3, 
      6-10, 12, and 17 result from a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the DNA-coding 
      sequence. Intriguingly, recent work has demonstrated that increased trinucleotde 
      expansions in the SCA7 gene result in defect in the function of the SAGA histone 
      acetyltransferase complex. The SCA7 gene encodes a subunit of the SAGA complex. 
      This subunit is conserved in yeast as the SGF73 gene. We demonstrate that Sgf73 
      is required to recruit the histone deubiquitination module into both SAGA and the 
      related SliK(SALSA) complex, and to maintain levels of histone ubiquitination, 
      which is necessary for regulation of transcription at a number of genes.

TI  - CTCF cis-regulates trinucleotide repeat instability in an epigenetic manner: a 
      novel basis for mutational hot spot determination.

AB  - At least 25 inherited disorders in humans result from microsatellite repeat 
      expansion. Dramatic variation in repeat instability occurs at different disease 
      loci and between different tissues; however, cis-elements and trans-factors 
      regulating the instability process remain undefined. Genomic fragments from the 
      human spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) locus, containing a highly unstable 
      CAG tract, were previously introduced into mice to localize cis-acting 
      "instability elements," and revealed that genomic context is required for repeat 
      instability. The critical instability-inducing region contained binding sites for 
      CTCF -- a regulatory factor implicated in genomic imprinting, chromatin 
      remodeling, and DNA conformation change. To evaluate the role of CTCF in repeat 
      instability, we derived transgenic mice carrying SCA7 genomic fragments with CTCF 
      binding-site mutations. We found that CTCF binding-site mutation promotes triplet 
      repeat instability both in the germ line and in somatic tissues, and that CpG 
      methylation of CTCF binding sites can further destabilize triplet repeat 
      expansions. As CTCF binding sites are associated with a number of highly unstable 
      repeat loci, our findings suggest a novel basis for demarcation and regulation of 
      mutational hot spots and implicate CTCF in the modulation of genetic repeat 
      instability.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) comprise a clinically and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of autosomal dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorders 
      affecting the cerebellum and to variable degrees further parts of the nervous 
      system. Electrophysiology is a potent tool to prove impairment of multiple 
      neuronal systems and fibre tracts and even to decipher subclinical affection. 
      Electrooculography, evoked potentials, nerve conduction studies and 
      polysomnography are especially helpful in the setting of SCAs. Severely slowed 
      saccades are a hallmark of SCA2. Vertical nystagmus occurs most frequently in 
      SCA3 and SCA6. Visual potentials recede especially in SCA7. Substantially 
      prolonged central motor conduction times in motor-evoked potentials occur 
      frequently in SCA1 even in patients without clinical signs of pyramidal 
      affection. Thus, electrophysiological analyses may help to predict the SCA 
      genotype and direct molecular genetic diagnostics. Polysomnography is a helpful 
      tool in the analysis of sleep disorders and frequently helps to decipher 
      treatable causes like periodic leg movement in sleep and REM sleep behaviour 
      disorder in SCAs. Nerve conduction studies reveal sensory neuropathy in all 
      common SCA subtypes, but to variable degrees. Age rather than CAG repeat length 
      appears to be the most important determinant for neuropathy and makes sensory 
      nerve action potentials a potential progression marker in SCA.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 is a rare autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia 
      (ADCA). Herein, we describe the molecular and clinical findings in patients 
      within six generations of a large Chinese family with spinocerebellar ataxia. To 
      identify the genetic cause(s), 4 affected patients and 26 asymptomatic relatives 
      were recruited for the study. Molecular screening of the SCA1 and SCA7 genes was 
      carried out by subcloning and direct PCR-sequencing methods. Both neurological 
      and ophthalmic examinations were performed to investigate the clinical 
      characteristics of the disease. The patients had typical cerebellar ataxia, 
      achromatopsia and macular degeneration, and displayed a rare phenotype 
      manifesting as a combination of cerebellar ataxia and craniocervical dystonia. 
      Mutational analysis of the SCA7 genes demonstrated expanded CAG-repeats in the 
      four patients. In conclusion, we identified expanded CAG-repeats in the SCA7 gene 
      within members of a large Chinese family with spinocerebellar ataxia. The defined 
      phenotypic characteristics of the patients may be helpful for clinical diagnosis 
      and genetic typing of new patients.

TI  - Molecular analysis of CAG repeats at five different spinocerebellar ataxia loci: 
      correlation and alternative explanations for disease pathogenesis.
PG  - 338-42
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are caused by expansion of (CAG)n triplet repeats. 
      These repeats occur as polymorphic forms in general population; however, beyond a 
      threshold size they become pathogenic. The sizes and distributions of repeats at 
      the SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA7 and DRPLA loci were assessed by molecular analysis of 
      124 unrelated ataxia patients and 44 controls, and the association of larger 
      normal (LN) alleles with disease prevalence was evaluated. Triplet repeat 
      expansions in the disease range were detected in 8% (10/124) of the cases, with 
      the majority having expansion at the SCA1 locus. Normal allele ranges in the 
      cohort studied were similar to the Caucasian and North Indian populations but 
      differed from the Korean and Japanese populations at various loci. The percentage 
      of individuals with LN alleles at the SCA1 and SCA2 loci was higher than reported 
      in Indians, Japanese and Caucasians. LN alleles showed a good correlation with 
      the incidence of SCA1, indicating that SCA1 is the most prevalent ataxia in our 
      population. The majority of cases with clinical symptoms of SCA could not be 
      diagnosed by established CAG repeat criteria, suggesting that there may be an 
      alternative basis for disease pathogenesis: (i) Repeats lower than the normal 
      range may also result in abnormal phenotypes (ii) LN alleles at different loci in 
      the same individual may contribute to symptoms (iii) Exogenous factors may play a 
      role in triggering disease symptoms in individuals with LN alleles (iv) Triplet 
      repeats may reach the disease range in the brain but not in the blood.

TI  - Case control analysis of repeat expansion size in ataxia.
PG  - 28-32
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of clinically and genetically 
      heterogeneous neurological diseases. The expansion of unstable microsatellite 
      repeats has been identified as the underlying pathogenic cause of 10 subtypes of 
      autosomal dominant SCAs. The aetiology of sporadic SCA is unknown. The aim of 
      this study was to investigate the effect of large normal repeats in patients 
      presenting with sporadic or familial ataxia compared to a control population. The 
      size of the expansion was determined using a fluorescent PCR approach in 10 
      common SCA genes: SCA-1 (ATXN1), SCA-2 (ATXN2), SCA-3 (ATXN3), SCA-6 (CACNA1A), 
      SCA-7 (ATXN7), SCA-8 (ATXN8OS), SCA-10 (ATXN10), SCA-12 (PPP2R2B), SCA-17 (TBP) 
      and DRPLA (ATN1), in 165 ataxia patients and 307 controls of Welsh origin. There 
      was no difference between cases and controls in the distribution of the large 
      normal alleles, or in the distribution of the combined CAG repeats. The normal 
      allele distribution in the Welsh population was largely similar to that of other 
      Caucasian populations. Our study failed to demonstrate an effect of large normal 
      repeats on the susceptibility to develop ataxia.

TI  - Multiplex families with multiple system atrophy.
PG  - 545-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple system atrophy (MSA) has been considered a sporadic disease, 
      without patterns of inheritance. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical features of 
      4 multiplex families with MSA, including clinical genetic aspects. DESIGN: 
      Clinical and genetic study. SETTING: Four departments of neurology in Japan. 
      Patients Eight patients in 4 families with parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, and 
      autonomic failure with age at onset ranging from 58 to 72 years. Two siblings in 
      each family were affected with these conditions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical 
      evaluation was performed according to criteria by Gilman et al. Trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion in the responsible genes for the spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 
      series and for dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) was evaluated by 
      polymerase chain reaction. Direct sequence analysis of coding regions in the 
      alpha-synuclein gene was performed. RESULTS: Consanguineous marriage was observed 
      in 1 of 4 families. Among 8 patients, 1 had definite MSA, 5 had probable MSA, and 
      2 had possible MSA. The most frequent phenotype was MSA with predominant 
      parkinsonism, observed in 5 patients. Six patients showed pontine atrophy with 
      cross sign or slitlike signal change at the posterolateral putaminal margin or 
      both on brain magnetic resonance imaging. Possibilities of hereditary ataxias, 
      including SCA1 (ataxin 1, ATXN1), SCA2 (ATXN2), Machado-Joseph disease/SCA3 
      (ATXN1), SCA6 (ATXN1), SCA7 (ATXN7), SCA12 (protein phosphatase 2, regulatory 
      subunit B, beta isoform; PP2R2B), SCA17 (TATA box binding protein, TBP) and DRPLA 
      (atrophin 1; ATN1), were excluded, and no mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene 
      were found. CONCLUSIONS: Findings in these multiplex families suggest the 
      presence of familial MSA with autosomal recessive inheritance and a genetic 
      predisposition to MSA. Molecular genetic approaches focusing on familial MSA are 
      expected to provide clues to the pathogenesis of MSA.

TI  - Massive SCA7 expansion detected in a 7-month-old male with hypotonia, 
      cardiomegaly, and renal compromise.
PG  - 140-3
AB  - Infantile spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is phenotypically different from 
      the child-onset and adult-onset cases, presenting as a multisystem disorder 
      associated with pathologically large CAG trinucleotide repeat sequences. We 
      describe a case study of a male who presented at 5 months of age with marked 
      motor delay, failure to thrive, and a patent ductus arteriosus. He later 
      developed renal failure of uncertain aetiology. The infant became progressively 
      hypotonic, and cardiac and renal function deteriorated further; he died at the 
      age of 11 months of multisystem failure. Family history revealed a diagnosis of 
      SCA7 in the infant's father, paternal grandfather, and aunt. DNA analysis 
      confirmed an expanded trinucleotide repeat in the SCA7 locus of about 240 
      repeats, suggesting a diagnosis of infantile SCA7. Striking anticipation is seen 
      in SCA7, particularly with paternal transmission. The underlying 
      pathophysiological processes seem to involve alteration in transcriptional 
      regulation and a selective neuronal vulnerability to the widely distributed 
      abnormal protein product. This case report reviews the current literature 
      relating to infantile SCA7 and raises awareness of this rare but important 
      phenotype.

TI  - Both normal and polyglutamine- expanded ataxin-7 are components of TFTC-type GCN5 
      histone acetyltransferase- containing complexes.
PG  - 155-63
AB  - SCA7 (spinocerebellar ataxia type 7) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      CAG repeat expansion in the SCA7 gene that leads to elongation of a polyglutamine 
      tract in ataxin-7, a protein of unknown function. Sgf73, a putative yeast 
      orthologue of ataxin-7, has been identified as a new component of the yeast SAGA 
      (Spt/Ada/Gcn5 acetyltransferase) multisubunit complex, a co-activator required 
      for the transcription of a subset of RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. We show 
      here that ataxin-7 is an integral component of mammalian SAGA-like complexes, 
      i.e. the TFTC [TBP (TATA-binding protein)-free TAF (TBP-associated factor) 
      complex] and the STAGA (SPT3/TAF9/GCN5 acetyltransferase) complex. In agreement 
      with this, immunoprecipitation of ataxin-7 retained a histone acetyltransferase 
      activity characteristic of TFTC-like complexes. Moreover, polyglutamine expansion 
      in ataxin-7 did not affect its incorporation into TFTCs/STAGA complexes purified 
      from cells from a SCA7 patient. We demonstrate here that ataxin-7 is the human 
      orthologue of a the yeast SAGA Sgf73 subunit, and is a bona fide subunit of human 
      TFTC-like transcriptional complexes.

TI  - Large pathogenic expansions in the SCA2 and SCA7 genes can be detected by 
      fluorescent repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction assay.
PG  - 128-32
AB  - Large expansions in the SCA2 and SCA7 genes (>100 CAG repeats) have been 
      associated with juvenile and infantile forms of cerebellar ataxias that cannot be 
      detected using standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Here, we describe a 
      successful application of the fluorescent short tandem repeat-primed PCR method 
      for accurate identification of these expanded repeats. The test is robust, 
      reliable, and inexpensive and can be used to screen large series of patients, 
      although it cannot give a precise evaluation of the size of the expansion. This 
      test may be of practical value in prenatal diagnoses offered to affected or 
      pre-symptomatic at-risk parents, in which a very large expansion inherited from 
      one of the parents can be missed in the fetus by standard PCR.

TI  - Polyglutamine expansion causes neurodegeneration by altering the neuronal 
      differentiation program.
PG  - 691-703
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) and spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) belong to a 
      group of inherited neurodegenerative diseases caused by polyglutamine (polyQ) 
      expansion in corresponding proteins. Transcriptional alteration is a unifying 
      feature of polyQ disorders; however, the relationship between polyQ-induced gene 
      expression deregulation and degenerative processes remains unclear. R6/2 and R7E 
      mouse models of HD and SCA7, respectively, present a comparable retinal 
      degeneration characterized by progressive reduction of electroretinograph 
      activity and important morphological changes of rod photoreceptors. The retina, 
      which is a simple central nervous system tissue, allows correlating functional, 
      morphological and molecular defects. Taking advantage of comparing polyQ-induced 
      degeneration in two retina models, we combined gene expression profiling and 
      molecular biology techniques to decipher the molecular pathways underlying polyQ 
      expansion toxicity. We show that R7E and R6/2 retinal phenotype strongly 
      correlates with loss of expression of a large cohort of genes specifically 
      involved in phototransduction function and morphogenesis of differentiated rod 
      photoreceptors. Accordingly, three key transcription factors (Nrl, Crx and Nr2e3) 
      controlling rod differentiation genes, hence expression of photoreceptor specific 
      traits, are down-regulated. Interestingly, other transcription factors known to 
      cause inhibitory effects on photoreceptor differentiation when mis-expressed, 
      such as Stat3, are aberrantly re-activated. Thus, our results suggest that 
      independently from the protein context, polyQ expansion overrides the control of 
      neuronal differentiation and maintenance, thereby causing dysfunction and 
      degeneration.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7): first report of a systematic 
      neuropathological study of the brain of a patient with a very short expanded 
      CAG-repeat.
PG  - 287-95
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) represents a very rare and severe autosomal 
      dominantly inherited cerebellar ataxia (ADCA). It belongs to the group of 
      CAG-repeat or polyglutamine diseases with its underlying molecular genetical 
      defect on chromosome 3p12-p21.1. Here, we performed a systematic study of the 
      neuropathology on unconventional thick serial sections of the first available 
      brain tissue of a genetically confirmed late-onset SCA7 patient with a very short 
      CAG-repeat expansion. Along with myelin pallor of a variety of central nervous 
      fiber tracts, we observed i) neurodegeneration in select areas of the cerebral 
      cortex, and ii) widespread nerve cell loss in the cerebellum, thalamus, nuclei of 
      the basal ganglia, and brainstem. In addition, upon immunocytochemical analysis 
      using the anti-polyglutamine antibody 1C2, immunopositive neuronal intranuclear 
      inclusions bodies (NI) were observed in all cerebellar regions, in all parts of 
      the cerebral cortex, and in telencephalic and brainstem nuclei, irrespective of 
      whether they underwent neurodegeneration. These novel findings provide 
      explanations for a variety of clinical symptoms and paraclinical findings of both 
      our and other SCA7 patients. Finally, our immunocytochemical analysis confirms 
      previous studies which described the presence of NI in obviously degenerated 
      brain and retinal regions as well as in apparently well-preserved brain regions 
      and retina of SCA7 patients.

TI  - CAG repeats in Restless Legs syndrome.
PG  - 173-6
AB  - Recent reports established an association of restless legs syndrome (RLS) and 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 1, 2, and 3. To evaluate the contribution of 
      SCA alleles to idiopathic RLS we investigated the CAG repeat length at the SCA1, 
      SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, and SCA17 loci in 215 patients who fulfilled the clinical 
      criteria of RLS and presented periodic leg movements in sleep (PLMS) in 
      polysomnographic recording. Fifty percent of patients had a positive family 
      history of RLS. We found one intermediate (CAG)(43) allele for SCA17 in a 
      44-year-old female with RLS starting at the age of 43. Neurologic examination and 
      family history were unremarkable in this patient. Otherwise, allele distribution 
      did not differ between RLS patients and healthy controls. Stratification for age, 
      age of onset, sex, peripheral neuropathy, and sporadic or familial RLS revealed 
      no effect. Thus, CAG repeat length in the investigated genes is not a major 
      determinant of idiopathic or familial RLS.

TI  - Polyglutamine and polyalanine expansions in ataxin7 result in different types of 
      aggregation and levels of toxicity.
PG  - 438-45
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is caused by expansion of a (CAG)n repeat in 
      the ataxin7 gene, resulting in an abnormally long polyglutamine polyQ tract in 
      the translated protein that aggregates in the form of neuronal intranuclear 
      inclusions. Polyalanine (polyA) stretches, implicated in several genetic 
      disorders, also appear to aggregate. To investigate the role of the aggregates in 
      the pathologies, we compared the effects of ataxin7 containing a polyA (ataxin7 - 
      90A) or polyQ (ataxin7 - 100Q) expansion in HEK 293 cells and in primary cultures 
      of rat mesencephalon. Both proteins formed nuclear and perinuclear aggregates 
      that contained molecular chaperones and components of the ubiquitin-proteasome 
      system, suggesting that they were abnormally folded. Ataxin-90A aggregates 
      differed morphologically from ataxin7 - 100Q aggregates, consisted of small and 
      amorphous rather than fibrillar inclusions and were more toxic to mesencephalic 
      neurons, suggesting that toxicity was determined by the type of aggregate rather 
      than the cellular misfolding response.

TI  - Post-zygotic de novo trinucleotide repeat expansion at spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 7 locus: evidence from an Indian family.
PG  - 155-157
LID - 10.1007/s10038-005-0233-0 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is an autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia 
      caused by CAG repeat expansion. We found expansion at SCA7 locus in only two out 
      of 235 Indian families clinically diagnosed for ataxia. In one of the families, a 
      de novo mutation was observed wherein a paternal allele in intermediate range of 
      31 CAG repeats expanded to 59 in the offspring leading to the disease. No 
      expanded alleles were observed in the sperm of the transmitting parent by small 
      pool PCR. This suggests that de novo expansion by a pre-zygotic event is unlikely 
      and could be post-zygotic. SCA7 expanded alleles from the two families were 
      present on different genetic backgrounds, indicating multiple origins of the 
      mutation.

TI  - A SCA7 CAG/CTG repeat expansion is stable in Drosophila melanogaster despite 
      modulation of genomic context and gene dosage.
PG  - 35-41
AB  - CAG and CTG repeat expansions are the cause of at least a dozen inherited 
      neurological disorders. In these so-called "dynamic mutation" diseases, the 
      expanded repeats display dramatic genetic instability, changing in size when 
      transmitted through the germline and within somatic tissues. As the molecular 
      basis of the repeat instability process remains poorly understood, modeling of 
      repeat instability in model organisms has provided some insights into potentially 
      involved factors, implicating especially replication and repair pathways. Studies 
      in mice have also shown that the genomic context of the repeat sequence is 
      required for CAG/CTG repeat instability in the case of spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 7 (SCA7), one of the most unstable of all CAG/CTG repeat disease loci. While 
      most studies of repeat instability have taken a candidate gene approach, unbiased 
      screens for factors involved in trinucleotide repeat instability have been 
      lacking. We therefore attempted to use Drosophila melanogaster to model expanded 
      CAG repeat instability by creating transgenic flies carrying trinucleotide repeat 
      expansions, deriving flies with SCA7 CAG90 repeats in cDNA and genomic context. 
      We found that SCA7 CAG90 repeats are stable in Drosophila, regardless of context. 
      To screen for genes whose reduced function might destabilize expanded CAG repeat 
      tracts in Drosophila, we crossed the SCA7 CAG90 repeat flies with various 
      deficiency stocks, including lines lacking genes encoding the orthologues of flap 
      endonuclease-1, PCNA, and MutS. In all cases, perfect repeat stability was 
      preserved, suggesting that Drosophila may not be a suitable system for 
      determining the molecular basis of SCA7 CAG repeat instability.

TI  - Trinucleotide repeat analysis of spinocerebellar ataxia patients in Oman.
PG  - 61-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the profile of cytosine/adenine/guanine (CAG) repeat 
      expansion in Omani spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) patients. METHODS: Ten SCA 
      patients attending the Sultan Qaboos University Hospital Neurologic clinics, 
      Al-Khoud, Oman in the 3 years starting from January 2000 were recruited for this 
      study. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples and CAG repeat 
      expansion analysis was carried out by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing, 
      when required. RESULTS: The CAG triplet repeats leading to polyglutamine 
      expansion and neurodegeneration are seen in spinocerebellar ataxias 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 
      and 17. By using primers for SCA 1, 2, 3 and 7, we found the repeats were in the 
      normal range and triplet repeats do not seem to be a common cause for ataxia in 
      Oman. CONCLUSION: Spinocerebellar ataxia in Oman has the normal range of CAG 
      repeats for the commonly found SCA1, SCA2, SCA3 and SCA7.

TI  - Ataxin-7 aggregation and ubiquitination in infantile SCA7 with 180 CAG repeats.
PG  - 448-52
AB  - Extremely long (>150) CAG repeats are often used to create models of 
      polyglutamine diseases yet are very rare in humans where they manifest as 
      pediatric multisystem syndromes of little specificity. Here, we describe an 
      infant with 180 CAG repeats in the spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 gene and focus 
      on systemic ataxin-7 aggregation. This was found in many organs, including the 
      cardiovascular system. In the brain, the hippocampus emerged as a principal site 
      of ataxin-7 aggregation without cell loss. We note differential ubiquitination of 
      aggregates and discuss how this may relate to selective vulnerability.

TI  - Molecular genetics of hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia: mutation analysis of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia genes and CAG/CTG repeat expansion detection in 225 
      Italian families.
PG  - 727-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias are a clinical and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of progressive neurodegenerative diseases, at present 
      associated with 22 loci (spinocerebellar ataxia [SCA] 1-SCA8, SCA10-SCA19, SCA21, 
      SCA22, fibroblast growth factor 14 [FGF14]-SCA, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy [DRPLA]). The relevant gene has been identified in 12 cases (SCA1-3, 
      SCA6-8, SCA10, SCA12, FGF14, and DRPLA), and in all but the recently identified 
      SCA14, SCA17, PRKCG and FGF14 genes, the defect consists of the expansion of a 
      short nucleotide repeat. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relative prevalence of 
      SCA1-3, SCA6-8, SCA10, SCA12, and SCA17 gene expansions in Italian families with 
      hereditary ataxia, specifically to verify the occurrence of SCA10, SCA12, and 
      SCA17 in Italy; and to analyze samples from probands with negative test results 
      at the initial screening by means of the repeat expansion detection technique to 
      identify CAG/CTG expansions in novel loci.Patients Two hundred twenty-five 
      unrelated Italian index cases with hereditary ataxia, most (n = 183) of whom 
      presented with a clear dominantly transmitted trait. RESULTS: We found that SCA1 
      and SCA2 gene mutations accounted for most cases (21% and 24%, respectively). We 
      found SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, and SCA17 to be very rare (approximately 1% each), 
      and no case of SCA10 or SCA12 was identified. Half of the index cases (113/225) 
      were negative for expansions in the known SCA genes. Repeat expansion detection 
      analysis performed on 111 of these cases showed a CAG/CTG repeat expansion of at 
      least 50 triplets in 22 (20%). Twenty-one of 22 expansions could be attributed to 
      length variation at 2 polymorphic loci (expanded repeat domain CAG/CTG 1 [ERDA1] 
      or CTG repeat on chromosome 18q21.1 [CTG18.1]). In 1 patient, the expansion was 
      assigned to the DRPLA gene. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of SCA1-3 and SCA6-7 
      gene mutations is peculiar in Italy. We found a relatively high frequency of SCA1 
      and SCA2 gene expansions; SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7 mutations were rare, compared with 
      other European countries. No SCA10 or SCA12 and only a few SCA8 (2/225) and SCA17 
      (2/225) families were detected. In patients negative for defects in known SCA 
      genes, repeat expansion detection data strongly suggest that, at least in our 
      population, CAG/CTG expansions in novel genes should be considered an unlikely 
      cause of the SCA phenotype.

TI  - Ataxin-7 is a subunit of GCN5 histone acetyltransferase-containing complexes.
PG  - 1257-65
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      CAG repeat expansion in the SCA7 gene leading to elongation of a polyglutamine 
      tract in ataxin-7, a protein of unknown function. A putative ataxin-7 yeast 
      orthologue (SGF73) has been identified recently as a new component of the SAGA 
      (Spt/Ada/Gcn5 acetylase) multisubunit complex, a coactivator required for 
      transcription of a subset of RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. We show here that 
      ataxin-7 is an integral component of the mammalian SAGA-like complexes, the 
      TATA-binding protein-free TAF-containing complex (TFTC) and the SPT3/TAF9/GCN5 
      acetyltransferase complex (STAGA). In agreement, immunoprecipitation of ataxin-7 
      retained a histone acetyltransferase activity, characteristic for TFTC-like 
      complexes. We further identified a minimal domain in ataxin-7 that is required 
      for interaction with TFTC/STAGA subunits and is conserved highly through 
      evolution, allowing the identification of a SCA7 gene family. We showed that this 
      domain contains a conserved Cys(3)His motif that binds zinc, forming a new 
      zinc-binding domain. Finally, polyglutamine expansion in ataxin-7 did not affect 
      its incorporation into TFTC/STAGA complexes purified from SCA7 patient cells. We 
      demonstrate here that ataxin-7 is the human orthologue of the yeast SAGA SGF73 
      subunit and is a bona fide subunit of the human TFTC-like transcriptional 
      complexes.

TI  - Analysis of trinucleotide repeats in different SCA loci in spinocerebellar ataxia 
      patients and in normal population of Taiwan.
PG  - 355-60
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify various subtypes of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) among 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) patients referred to our research 
      center, SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD (Machado-Joseph disease), SCA6, SCA7, SCA8 and SCA12 
      loci were assessed for expansion of trinucleotide repeats. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      A total of 211 ADCA patients, including 202 patients with dominantly inherited 
      ataxia from 81 Taiwanese families and nine patients with sporadic ataxia, were 
      included in this study and subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. 
      The amplified products of all loci were analyzed on both 3% agarose gels and 6% 
      denaturing urea-polyacrylamide gels. PCR-based Southern blots were also applied 
      for the detection of SCA7 locus. RESULTS: The SCA1 mutation was detected in six 
      affected individuals from one family (1.2%) with expanded alleles of 50-53 CAG 
      repeats. Fourteen individuals from nine families (11%) had a CAG trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion at the SCA2 locus, while affected SCA2 alleles have 34-49 CAG 
      repeats. The SCA3/MJD CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in 60 affected 
      individuals from 26 families (32%) was expanded to 71-85 CAG repeats. As for the 
      SCA7 locus, there were two affected individuals from one family (1.2%) possessed 
      41 and 100 CAG repeats, respectively. However, we did not detect expansion in the 
      SCA6, SCA8 and SCA12 loci in any patient. CONCLUSIONS: The SCA3/MJD CAG expansion 
      was the most frequent mutation among the SCA patients. The relative prevalence of 
      SCA3/MJD in Taiwan was higher than that of SCA2, SCA1 and SCA7.

TI  - Possible reduced penetrance of expansion of 44 to 47 CAG/CAA repeats in the 
      TATA-binding protein gene in spinocerebellar ataxia type 17.
PG  - 209-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17) is an autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxia caused by expansion of CAG/CAA trinucleotide repeats in the 
      TATA-binding protein (TBP) gene. Because the number of triplets in patients with 
      SCA17 in previous studies ranged from 43 to 63, the normal number of 
      trinucleotide units has been considered to be 42 or less. However, some healthy 
      subjects in SCA17 pedigrees carry alleles with the same number of expanded 
      repeats as patients with SCA17. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the minimum number of 
      CAG/CAA repeats in the TBP gene that causes SCA17. DESIGN: We amplified the 
      region of the TBP gene containing the CAG/CAA repeat by means of polymerase chain 
      reaction and performed fragment and sequence analyses. PATIENTS: The subjects 
      included 734 patients with SCA (480 patients with sporadic SCA and 254 patients 
      with familial SCA) without CAG repeat expansions at the SCA1, SCA2, 
      Machado-Joseph disease, SCA6, SCA7, or dentatorubral-pallidolluysian atrophy 
      loci, with 162 healthy subjects, 216 patients with Parkinson disease, and 195 
      with Alzheimer disease as control subjects. RESULTS: Eight patients with SCA 
      possessed an allele with more than 43 CAG/CAA repeats. Among the non-SCA groups, 
      alleles with 43 to 45 repeats were seen in 3 healthy subjects and 2 with 
      Parkinson disease. In 1 SCA pedigree, a patient with possible SCA17 and her 
      healthy sister had alleles with 45 repeats. A 34-year-old man carrying alleles 
      with 47 and 44 repeats (47/44) had developed progressive cerebellar ataxia and 
      myoclonus at 25 years of age, and he exhibited dementia and pyramidal signs. He 
      was the only affected person in his pedigree, although his father and mother 
      carried alleles with mildly expanded repeats (44/36 and 47/36, respectively). In 
      another pedigree, 1 patient carried a 43-repeat allele, whereas another patient 
      had 2 normal alleles, indicating that the 43-repeat allele may not be pathologic 
      in this family. CONCLUSIONS: We estimate that 44 CAG/CAA repeats is the minimum 
      number required to cause SCA17. However, the existence of unaffected subjects 
      with mildly expanded triplets suggests that the TBP gene mutation may not 
      penetrate fully. Homozygosity of alleles with mildly expanded triplet repeats in 
      the TBP gene might contribute to the pathologic phenotype.

TI  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia: SCA2 is the most frequent mutation in 
      eastern India.
PG  - 448-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) has been reported as the 
      commonest dominant hereditary ataxia in India. However, India is an ethnically 
      and religiously diverse population. Previous studies have not clearly indicated 
      exact ethnic and religious origins, and must therefore be interpreted with 
      caution. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of different 
      SCA mutations in a relatively homogeneous population from eastern India. METHODS: 
      We identified 28 families with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia from eastern 
      India. Each underwent full clinical evaluation and were analysed for the presence 
      of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, and SCA17 mutations. In addition, 
      haplotype analysis was carried out in seven of the 16 families with SCA2. 
      RESULTS: Seven patients from four (14%) families were positive for an expansion 
      in SCA1 and 26 patients from 16 (57%) families were positive for an expansion in 
      SCA2. No mutations were detected in the remaining eight families (29%). Most of 
      the SCA1 and SCA2 families were Hindu from the state of Bihar. Five out of 26 
      SCA2 patients in this study did not have slow saccades. In addition, four of 
      seven SCA1 patients had slow saccades. We found an association between the SCA2 
      CAG repeat expansion and the 285 base pair (bp) allele of microsatellite marker 
      D12S1672, and also data supportive of the association between the expansion and 
      the 225 bp allele of D12S1333, which has been previously described. CONCLUSIONS: 
      We conclude that (1) although slow ocular saccades are highly suggestive of SCA2, 
      that they are not universal, nor are they exclusive to this disorder and (2) SCA2 
      is likely to be the commonest dominant ataxia in eastern India, with further 
      evidence for a founder effect.

TI  - Frequency analysis and clinical characterization of spinocerebellar ataxia types 
      1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 in Korean patients.
PG  - 858-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: By genetic analysis, the CAG repeat expansion has been established in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7. Despite the genetic 
      differentiation of SCA, the characterization of the phenotypes of various SCAs 
      has been challenging for better clinical diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the 
      frequencies and the clinical manifestations of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7 
      in Korean patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed genetic analysis in 253 
      unrelated Korean patients with progressive cerebellar ataxia. We compared the 
      frequencies, inheritance patterns, and various clinical manifestations of 
      patients with genetically confirmed SCA. RESULTS: Among the 52 patients with 
      expanded CAG repeat, the most frequent SCA type was SCA2, followed by SCA3, SCA6, 
      SCA1, and SCA7. Nine patients (17%) had a negative family history of ataxia, 
      mostly in SCA6. There were characteristic clinical features such as hypotonia and 
      optic atrophy for SCA1; hyporeflexia for SCA2; nystagmus, bulging eye, and 
      dystonia for SCA3; and macular degeneration for SCA7. Interestingly, 4 patients 
      (1 with SCA2, 1 with SCA3, and 2 with SCA6) were misdiagnosed as having 
      multiple-system atrophy because of the absence of family history and the presence 
      of parkinsonism and urinary incontinence. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a 
      detailed analysis of the clinical characteristics of the genetically defined 
      CAG-repeat SCAs in Korean patients. Although phenotypes were heterogeneous, some 
      clinical features may be helpful for clinical diagnosis. However, genetic studies 
      for SCA are needed despite uncertain family history or the presence of atypical 
      clinical features causing misdiagnosis as atypical parkinsonism.

TI  - A novel autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA22) linked to chromosome 
      1p21-q23.
PG  - 1293-9
AB  - The autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) are a clinically, pathologically 
      and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders. Ten responsible genes have been 
      identified for spinocerebellar ataxia types SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, 
      SCA10, SCA12 and SCA17, and dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). The 
      mutation is caused by an expansion of a CAG, CTG or ATTCT repeat sequence of 
      these genes. Six additional loci, SCA4, SCA5, SCA11, SCA13, SCA14 and SCA16 have 
      also been mapped. The growing heterogeneity of the autosomal dominant forms of 
      these diseases shows that the genetic aetiologies of at least 20% of ADCA have 
      yet to be elucidated. We ascertained and clinically characterized a 
      four-generation Chinese pedigree segregating an autosomal dominant phenotype for 
      cerebellar ataxia. Direct mutation analysis, linkage analysis for all known SCA 
      loci and a genome-wide linkage study were performed. Direct mutation analysis 
      excluded SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 17 and DRPLA, and genetic linkage analysis 
      excluded SCA4, 5, 11, 13, 14 and 16. The genome-wide linkage study suggested 
      linkage to a locus on chromosome 1p21-q23, with the highest two-point LOD score 
      at D1S1167 (Zmax = 3.46 at theta = 0.00). Multipoint analysis and haplotype 
      reconstruction traced this novel SCA locus (SCA22) to a 43.7-cM interval flanked 
      by D1S206 and D1S2878 (Zmax = 3.78 under four liability classes, and 2.67 using 
      affected-only method). The age at onset ranged from 10 to 46 years. All affected 
      members had gait ataxia with variable features of dysarthria and hyporeflexia. 
      Head MRI showed homogeneous atrophy of the cerebellum without involvement of the 
      brainstem. In six parent-child pairs, median onset occurred 10 years earlier in 
      offspring than in their parents, suggesting anticipation. This family is distinct 
      from other families with SCA and is characterized by a slowly progressive, pure 
      cerebellar ataxia.

TI  - Genomic context drives SCA7 CAG repeat instability, while expressed SCA7 cDNAs 
      are intergenerationally and somatically stable in transgenic mice.
PG  - 41-50
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is an autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the ataxin-7 gene. In humans, SCA7 is 
      characterized by marked anticipation due to intergenerational repeat instability 
      with a bias toward expansion, and is thus regarded as the most unstable of the 
      polyglutamine diseases. To study the molecular basis of CAG/CTG repeat 
      instability and its pathological significance, we generated lines of transgenic 
      mice carrying either a SCA7 cDNA construct or a 13.5 kb SCA7 genomic fragment 
      with 92 CAG repeats. While the cDNA transgenic mice showed little 
      intergenerational repeat instability, the genomic fragment transgenic mice 
      displayed marked intergenerational instability with an obvious expansion bias. We 
      then went on to generate additional lines of genomic fragment transgenic mice, 
      and observed that deletion of the 3' genomic region significantly stabilized 
      intergenerational transmission of the SCA7 CAG92 repeat. These results suggest 
      that cis-information present on the genomic fragment is driving the instability 
      process. As the SCA7 genomic fragment contains a large number of 
      replication-associated motifs, the presence of such sequence elements may make 
      the SCA7 CAG repeat region more susceptible to instability. Small-pool and 
      standard PCR analysis of tissues from genomic fragment mice revealed large repeat 
      expansions in their brains and livers, but no such changes were found in any 
      tissues from cDNA transgenic mice that have been shown to undergo 
      neurodegeneration. As large somatic repeat expansions are absent from the brains 
      of SCA7 cDNA mice, our results indicate that neurodegeneration can occur without 
      marked somatic mosaicism, at least in these mice.

TI  - Trinucleotide repeats in 202 families with ataxia: a small expanded (CAG)n allele 
      at the SCA17 locus.
PG  - 623-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ten neurodegenerative disorders characterized by spinocerebellar 
      ataxia (SCA) are known to be caused by trinucleotide repeat (TNR) expansions. 
      However, in some instances the molecular diagnosis is considered indeterminate 
      because of the overlap between normal and affected allele ranges. In addition, 
      the mechanism that generates expanded alleles is not completely understood. 
      OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical and molecular characteristics of a large group 
      of Portuguese and Brazilian families with ataxia to improve knowledge of the 
      molecular diagnosis of SCA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have (1) assessed repeat 
      sizes at all known TNR loci implicated in SCA; (2) determined frequency 
      distributions of normal alleles and expansions; and (3) looked at 
      genotype-phenotype correlations in 202 unrelated Portuguese and Brazilian 
      patients with SCA. Molecular analysis of TNR expansions was performed using 
      polymerase chain reaction amplification. RESULTS: Patients from 110 unrelated 
      families with SCA showed TNR expansions at 1 of the loci studied. Dominantly 
      transmitted cases had (CAG)(n) expansions at the Machado-Joseph disease gene 
      (MJD1) (63%), at SCA2 (3%), the gene for dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy 
      (DRPLA) (2%), SCA6 (1%), or SCA7 (1%) loci, or (CTG)(n) expansions at the SCA8 
      (2%) gene, whereas (GAA)(n) expansions in the Freidreich ataxia gene (FRDA) were 
      found in 64% of families with recessive ataxia. Isolated patients also had TNR 
      expansions at the MJD1 (6%), SCA8 (6%), or FRDA (8%) genes; in addition, an 
      expanded allele at the TATA-binding protein gene (TBP), with 43 CAGs, was present 
      in a patient with ataxia and mental deterioration. Associations between 
      frequencies of SCA2 and SCA6 and a frequency of large normal alleles were found 
      in Portuguese and Brazilian individuals, respectively. Interestingly, no 
      association between the frequencies of DRPLA and large normal alleles was found 
      in the Portuguese group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that (1) a significant 
      number of isolated cases of ataxia are due to TNR expansions; (2) expanded DRPLA 
      alleles in Portuguese families may have evolved from an ancestral haplotype; and 
      (3) small (CAG)(n) expansions at the TBP gene may cause SCA17.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxias in the Netherlands: prevalence and age at onset variance 
      analysis.
PG  - 702-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: International prevalence estimates of autosomal dominant cerebellar 
      ataxias (ADCA) vary from 0.3 to 2.0 per 100,000. The prevalence of ADCA in the 
      Netherlands is unknown. Fifteen genetic loci have been identified (SCA-1-8, 
      SCA-10-14, SCA-16, and SCA-17) and nine of the corresponding genes have been 
      cloned. In SCA-1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA-12 and SCA-17 the mutation has been 
      shown to be an expanded CAG repeat. Previously, the length of the CAG repeat was 
      found to account for 50 to 80% of variance in age at onset. Because of 
      heterogeneity in encoded proteins, different pathophysiologic mechanisms leading 
      to neurodegeneration could be involved. The relationship between CAG repeat 
      length and age at onset would then differ accordingly. METHOD: Based on the 
      results of SCA mutation analysis in the three DNA diagnostic laboratories that 
      serve the entire Dutch population, the authors surveyed the number of families 
      and affected individuals per SCA gene, as well as individual repeat length and 
      age at onset. Regression analysis was applied to study the relationship between 
      CAG repeat length and age at onset per SCA gene. The slopes of the different 
      regression curves were compared. RESULTS: On November 1, 2000, mutations were 
      found in 145 ADCA families and 391 affected individuals were identified. The 
      authors extrapolated a minimal prevalence of 3.0 per 100,000 (range 2.8 to 
      3.8/100,000). SCA3 was the most frequent mutation. CAG repeat length contributed 
      to 52 to 76% of age at onset variance. Regression curve slopes for SCA-1, SCA2, 
      SCA3, and SCA7 did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated minimal 
      prevalence of ADCA in the Netherlands is 3.0 per 100,000 inhabitants. Except for 
      SCA6, the relationship between age at onset and CAG repeat expansion does not 
      differ significantly between SCA-1, SCA2, SCA3, and SCA7 patient groups in our 
      population, indicating that these SCA subtypes share similar mechanisms of 
      polyglutamine-induced neurotoxicity, despite heterogeneity in gene products.

TI  - Spastic paraplegia, ataxia, mental retardation (SPAR): a novel genetic disorder.
PG  - 411-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a kindred with a dominantly inherited neurologic disorder 
      manifested either as uncomplicated spastic paraplegia or ataxia, spastic 
      paraplegia, and mental retardation. METHODS: Neurologic examinations and 
      molecular genetic analysis (exclusion of known SCA and HSP genes and loci; and 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion detection [RED]) were performed in six affected 
      and four unaffected subjects in this family. MRI, electromyography (EMG), and 
      nerve conduction studies were performed in three affected subjects. RESULTS: The 
      phenotype of this dominantly inherited syndrome varied in succeeding generations. 
      Pure spastic paraplegia was present in the earliest generation; subsequent 
      generations had ataxia and mental retardation. MRI showed marked atrophy of the 
      spinal cord in all patients and cerebellar atrophy in those with ataxia. 
      Laboratory analysis showed that the disorder was not caused by mutations in genes 
      that cause SCA-1, SCA-2, SCA-3, SCA-6, SCA-7, SCA-8, and SCA-12; not linked to 
      other known loci for autosomal dominant ataxia (SCA-4, SCA-5, SCA-10, SCA-11, 
      SCA-13, SCA-14, and SCA-16); and not linked to known loci for autosomal dominant 
      hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) (SPG-3, SPG-4, SPG-6, SPG-8, SPG-9, SPG-10, 
      SPG-12, and SPG-13) or autosomal recessive HSP SPG-7. Analysis of 
      intergenerational differences in age at onset of symptoms suggests genetic 
      anticipation. Using RED, the authors did not detect expanded CAG, CCT, TGG, or 
      CGT repeats that segregate with the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The authors describe an 
      unusual, dominantly inherited neurologic disorder in which the phenotype (pure 
      spastic paraplegia or spastic ataxia with variable mental retardation) differed 
      in subsequent generations. The molecular explanation for apparent genetic 
      anticipation does not appear to involve trinucleotide repeat expansion.

TI  - Molecular analysis of Spinocerebellar ataxias in Koreans: frequencies and 
      reference ranges of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7.
PG  - 336-41
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      disorders. CAG repeat expansions in the causative genes have been identified as 
      the basic cause of several types of SCAs, and have been used for the diagnoses 
      and classifications of patients with ataxia. In order to assess the frequency and 
      CAG repeat size ranges of SCAs, and to establish an effective strategy for 
      molecular diagnosis, we performed a molecular analysis of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, 
      and SCA7 in 76 patients. These patients were as follows: 32 with dominant 
      inheritance, 39 sporadic cases, and 5 with unknown family histories. The normal 
      and affected CAG repeat size ranges were established at five SCA loci in Koreans, 
      which was consistent with previous reports. The total prevalence of the five 
      types of SCAs was 39.5% in the 76 patients with ataxia, regardless of their 
      family history. It was 75.0% in the 32 families with a dominant inheritance. The 
      most frequent type was SCA3 (15.8%), followed by SCA2 (14.5%). Both types 
      combined formed 76.7% of the 30 patients with CAG expansions. SCA1, SCA6, and 
      SCA7 were less frequent, affecting 3.9%, 2.6%, and 2.6% of the cases, 
      respectively. This mutation spectrum is quite different from a previous report 
      concerning Koreans, but is similar to the distributions that are seen in several 
      ethnic populations worldwide. For a correct and effective diagnosis of SCAs, we 
      suggest that a molecular diagnosis be undertaken, even in patients without a 
      family history, as well as those with a family history. A stepwise approach is 
      also recommended. Patients with ataxia should be tested for SCA2 and SCA3. 
      Individuals testing negative should be tested for SCA1, SCA6, and SCA7.

TI  - Linkage analysis suggests a region of importance for multiple sclerosis in 
      3p14-13.
PG  - 451-4
AB  - Four genomic screens for linkage in multiple sclerosis (MS) have been reported. 
      They confirmed the established role of the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) complex 
      genes in MS and, in addition, suggested the importance of a few other chromosomal 
      segments. Here we report evidence for the importance of 3p14-13 region identified 
      by suggestive linkage in genomic screens from Canada and the United Kingdom. When 
      studying 146 Nordic MS multiplex families, mostly affected sib-pairs, with eight 
      microsatellite markers, spanning a 36-cM region, we observed a two-point 
      non-parametric linkage (NPL) score of 2.39 (P = 0.007) by the GENEHUNTER package 
      for marker D3S1285 and a multipoint NPL score of 1.20 in the same region. 
      Association studies in Swedish MS patients revealed modest allelic associations 
      of uncertain significance not supported by transmission analysis. Analysis of the 
      trinucleotide repeat sequence of the SCA7 gene in Swedish index cases did not 
      reveal expansions. We conclude that support was obtained for the location of a 
      gene or genes with importance for MS susceptibility in 3p14-13 region.

TI  - Polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-7 antagonizes CRX function and induces cone-rod 
      dystrophy in a mouse model of SCA7.
PG  - 913-27
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by 
      a CAG repeat expansion. To determine the mechanism of neurotoxicity, we produced 
      transgenic mice and observed a cone-rod dystrophy. Nuclear inclusions were 
      present, suggesting that the disease pathway involves the nucleus. When yeast 
      two-hybrid assays indicated that cone-rod homeobox protein (CRX) interacts with 
      ataxin-7, we performed further studies to assess this interaction. We found that 
      ataxin-7 and CRX colocalize and coimmunoprecipitate. We observed that 
      polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-7 can dramatically suppress CRX transactivation. In 
      SCA7 transgenic mice, electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated reduced CRX 
      binding activity, while RT-PCR analysis detected reductions in CRX-regulated 
      genes. Our results suggest that CRX transcription interference accounts for the 
      retinal degeneration in SCA7 and thus may provide an explanation for how 
      cell-type specificity is achieved in this polyglutamine repeat disease.

TI  - Frequency analysis of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias in Taiwanese patients 
      and clinical and molecular characterization of spinocerebellar ataxia type 6.
PG  - 1105-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is a heterogeneous group of 
      neurodegenerative disorders. The mutational basis for most of these disorders is 
      an expanded CAG repeat sequence within the coding regions of the genes involved. 
      The prevalence of SCA in the ethnic Chinese on Taiwan remains unclear. Moreover, 
      there has been no report of SCA type 6 (SCA6) among Chinese people. OBJECTIVES: 
      To characterize the prevalence of SCA in the ethnic Chinese on Taiwan, and to 
      specifically characterize Chinese patients with SCA6 in terms of clinical and 
      molecular features. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using a molecular approach, we 
      investigated SCA in 74 Taiwanese families with dominantly inherited ataxias and 
      in 49 Taiwanese patients with sporadic ataxias. Clinical and molecular features 
      of SCA6 were further characterized in 12 patients from 8 families and in 2 
      sporadic cases. Furthermore, the intragenic polymorphic marker D19S1150 was 
      amplified by polymerase chain reaction to analyze for linkage disequilibrium. 
      RESULTS: Machado-Joseph disease-SCA3 was the most common type of autosomal 
      dominant SCA in the Taiwanese cohort, accounting for 35 cases (47.3%), followed 
      by SCA6 (8 [10.8%]), SCA2 (8 [10.8%]), SCA1 (4 [5.4%]), SCA7 (2 [2.7%]), 
      dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (1 [1.4%]), and SCA8 (0%). The genes 
      responsible for 16 (21.6%) of Taiwanese dominantly inherited SCA cases remain to 
      be determined. Among the 49 patients with sporadic ataxias in the present series, 
      2 (4.1%) were found to harbor SCA6 mutations. In the families with SCA6, we found 
      significant anticipation in the absence of genetic instability on transmission, 
      indicating that some other mechanism might account for the anticipation. The same 
      frequent allele of the intragenic DNA marker (D19S1150) was shared by 7 of 10 
      Taiwanese families with SCA6. CONCLUSIONS: Although SCA6 has, so far, not been 
      reported in mainland Chinese, we found a geographic cluster of families with SCA6 
      on Taiwan. Genotyping studies suggest a founder effect in the Taiwanese patients 
      with SCA6.

TI  - Clinical features and genetic analysis of a new form of spinocerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 234-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) are a clinically 
      heterogeneous group of disorders. The mutations for SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, 
      SCA8, and SCA-12 are identified and caused by an expansion of a CAG or a CTG 
      repeat sequence of these genes. Six additional loci for SCA4, SCA5, SCA-10, 
      SCA-11, SCA-13, and SCA-14 are mapped. The growing heterogeneity of the autosomal 
      dominant forms of these diseases shows that the genetic etiologies of at least 
      20% of ADCA have yet to be elucidated. METHODS: The authors ascertained and 
      clinically characterized a four-generation pedigree segregating an autosomal 
      dominant phenotype for SCA. Direct mutation analysis, repeat expansion detection 
      analysis, and linkage analysis for all known SCA loci were performed. RESULTS: 
      Direct mutational analysis excluded SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 12; genetic linkage 
      analysis excluded SCA4, 5,10, 11, 13, and 14, giving significant negative lod 
      scores. Examination of the family showed that all affected members had gait 
      ataxia and akinesia with variable features of dysarthria, hyporeflexia, and mild 
      intellectual impairment. Eye movements were normal. Head MRI showed atrophy of 
      the cerebellum without involvement of the brainstem. In 10 parent-child pairs, 
      median onset occurred 10.5 years earlier in offspring than in their parents, 
      suggesting anticipation. CONCLUSION: This family is distinct from other families 
      with SCA and is characterized by cerebellar ataxia and extrapyramidal signs.

TI  - Evidence that allelic variants of the spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 gene 
      influence susceptibility to multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 91-6
AB  - Expanded CAG trinucleotide repeats are known to be responsible for five of the 
      autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7). We 
      have typed each of these repeats in 226 multiple sclerosis sibling pair families. 
      No expanded repeats were seen, indicating an absence of SCA phenocopies in 
      clinically defined familial multiple sclerosis. However, transmission 
      disequilibrium testing for these repeats demonstrated significant excess 
      transmission of the 22 repeat length allele of the SCA2 gene (P=4. 4E-06) in 
      multiple sclerosis patients. This observation is consistent with pleiotropic 
      effects of the SCA2 gene, with a non-dynamic mutation/polymorphism contributing 
      epistatically to susceptibility in multiple sclerosis.

TI  - Macular degeneration associated with aberrant expansion of trinucleotide repeat 
      of the SCA7 gene in 2 Japanese families.
PG  - 1415-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the macular function of Japanese patients with a 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion in the spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) gene. 
      METHODS: Ophthalmic findings in patients whose DNA analysis revealed expanded 
      alleles of the trinucleotide repeat in the SCA7 gene were evaluated. RESULTS: 
      Trinucleotide repeat was expanded from 40 to 48 in affected patients (control 
      subjects, 12 repeats). Affected patients were characterized by different degrees 
      of visual acuity decrease (0.09-0.9), a tritan axis color vision, a coarse 
      granular appearance of the macular region on scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, 
      depression of multifocal electroretinograms, and macular degeneration. However, 
      pigmentary changes were not observed in the retina. The trinucleotide repeat was 
      longer and the onset of macular dysfunction was earlier in the younger 
      generation. One patient in a family manifested decreased visual acuity 10 years 
      preceding other neurologic signs. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Patients 
      with SCA7 mutations showed macular dysfunction or degeneration with expansion of 
      CAG repeat in the SCA7 gene. However, the lesions were less pigmented than those 
      previously reported. Patients also showed ophthalmologic anticipation, which has 
      not been reported for the ocular changes in other patients who have trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion of the responsible genes.

TI  - Molecular and clinical study of spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 in Chinese 
      kindreds.
PG  - 1513-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical and molecular characteristics of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) in Chinese kindreds. BACKGROUND: 
      Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 is caused by the expansion of an unstable CAG 
      repeat in the first exon of the SCA7 gene. METHODS: Clinical and related 
      examinations were performed in all affected or at-risk individuals from 4 Chinese 
      families presenting with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia and decreased 
      visual acuity. The size of the (CAG)(n) array of the SCA7 gene was detected by 
      polymerase chain reaction, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and related 
      techniques in the 4 families and 67 healthy controls. The relationship between 
      expanded repeat number and age of onset was statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The 
      SCA7 mutation was identified in 2 families. Clinical study revealed that great 
      variation occurred in the age of onset, initial symptoms, and associated signs. 
      Meanwhile, the analysis of 11 parent-child couples demonstrated the existence of 
      marked anticipation. Some distinct retinal changes were noted in 2 affected 
      patients. All SCA7 patients in our series exhibited expanded CAG repeats, ranging 
      from 44 to 85 repeats, with a strong negative correlation between repeat size and 
      age of onset. Repeat lengths of expanded alleles showed somatic mosaicism in 
      leukocyte DNA. There were some subtle clinical differences between the 
      SCA7-positive and -negative cases. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical variation occurred not 
      only among the SCA7 families but also within the same kindred. Meiotic and 
      mitotic instability of the CAG repeat in the SCA7 gene were demonstrated, and 
      intergenerational instability of the array was associated with the clinical 
      phenomenon of anticipation. Arch Neurol. 2000;57:1513-1518

TI  - Genetic background of apparently idiopathic sporadic cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 132-7
AB  - Disease-causing mutations have been identified in various entities of autosomal 
      dominant ataxia and in Friedreich's ataxia. However, no molecular pathogenic 
      factor is known to cause idiopathic cerebellar ataxias. We investigated the 
      CAG/CTG trinucleotide repeats causing spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 
      8 and 12, and the GAA repeat of the frataxin gene in 124 patients apparently 
      suffering from idiopathic sporadic ataxia, including 20 patients with the 
      clinical diagnosis of multiple system atrophy. Patients with a positive family 
      history, a typical Friedreich phenotype, or symptomatic ataxia were excluded. 
      Genetic analyses uncovered the most common Friedreich mutation in 10 patients 
      with an age at onset between 13 and 36 years. The SCA6 mutation was present in 
      nine patients with disease onset between 47 and 68 years of age. The CTG repeat 
      associated with SCA8 was expanded in three patients. One patient had SCA2 
      attributable to a de novo mutation from a paternally transmitted, intermediate 
      allele. We did not identify the SCA1, SCA3, SCA7 or SCA12 mutation in idiopathic 
      sporadic ataxia patients. No trinucleotide repeat expansion was detected in the 
      MSA subgroup. This study has revealed the genetic basis in 19% of apparently 
      idiopathic ataxia patients. SCA6 is the most frequent mutation in late onset 
      cerebellar ataxia. The frataxin trinucleotide expansion should be investigated in 
      all sporadic ataxia patients with onset before age 40, even when the phenotype is 
      atypical for Friedreich's ataxia.

TI  - Analysis of CAG repeats in SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7 and DRPLA loci in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia patients and distribution of CAG repeats at the SCA1, SCA2 
      and SCA6 loci in nine ethnic populations of eastern India.
PG  - 597-604
AB  - To identify various subtypes of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) among 57 unrelated 
      individuals clinically diagnosed as ataxia patients we analysed the SCA1, SCA2, 
      SCA3, SCA6, SCA7 and DRPLA loci for expansion of CAG repeats. We detected CAG 
      repeat expansion in 6 patients (10.5%) at the SCA1 locus. Ten of the 57 patients 
      (17.5%) had CAG repeat expansion at the SCA2 locus, while four had CAG expansion 
      at the SCA3/MJD locus (7%). At the SCA6 locus there was a single patient (1.8%) 
      with 21 CAG repeats. We have not detected any patient with expansion in the SCA7 
      and DRPLA loci. To test whether the frequencies of the large normal alleles in 
      SCA1, SCA2 and SCA6 loci can reflect some light on prevalence of the subtypes of 
      SCAs we studied the CAG repeat variation in these loci in nine ethnic 
      sub-populations of eastern India from which the patients originated. We report 
      here that the frequency of large normal alleles (>31 CAG repeats) in SCA1 locus 
      to be 0.211 of 394 chromosomes studied. We also report that the frequency of 
      large normal alleles (>22 CAG repeats) at the SCA2 locus is 0.038 while at the 
      SCA6 locus frequency of large normal alleles (>13 repeats) is 0.032. We discussed 
      our data in light of the distribution of normal alleles and prevalence of SCAs in 
      the Japanese and white populations.

PG  - 31-6
AB  - Two hundred and forty-eight patients from 116 Italian families with dominant 
      ataxia were studied for CAG expansion within SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7 (spinocerebellar 
      ataxia) and DRPLA (dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy) genes. Fifty-six percent 
      of the families originated from Southern, 19% from Central and 25% from Northern 
      Italy. SCA2 was the commonest mutation, accounting for 47% of the families, 
      followed by SCA1 (24%), SCA6 (2%), SCA7 (2%) and DRPLA (1%). No SCA3 family was 
      found. Twenty-four percent of the families carried a still unidentified mutation. 
      When occurrence of mutations was evaluated according to the geographic origin, 
      SCA1 was the commonest in Northern (72%), whereas SCA2 was prevalent (63%) in 
      Southern Italy. The number of CAG repeats in SCA1 normal alleles was higher in 
      Northern than in Central-Southern Italy.

      gene mutated in the disease (SCA7) has been mapped to chromosome 3p12-13.5, and 
      positional cloning identified the cause of the disease as CAG repeat expansion in 
      this gene. The SCA7 gene product, ataxin-7, is an 897 amino acid protein with an 
      expandable polyglutamine tract close to its N-terminus. No clues to ataxin-7 
      function have been obtained from sequence database searches. Here we report that 
      ataxin-7 has a motif of ca. 50 amino acids, related to the phosphate-binding site 
      of arrestins. To test the relevance of this sequence similarity, we introduced 
      the putative ataxin-7 phosphate-binding site into visual arrestin and 
      beta-arrestin. Both chimeric arrestins retain receptor-binding affinity and show 
      characteristic high selectivity for phosphorylated activated forms of rhodopsin 
      and beta-adrenergic receptor, respectively. Although the insertion of a Gly 
      residue (absent in arrestins but present in the putative phosphate-binding site 
      of ataxin-7) disrupts the function of visual arrestin-ataxin-7 chimera, it 
      enhances the function of beta-arrestin-ataxin-7 chimera. Taken together, our data 
      suggest that the arrestin-like site in the ataxin-7 sequence is a functional 
      phosphate-binding site. The presence of the phosphate-binding site in ataxin-7 
      suggests that this protein may be involved in phosphorylation-dependent binding 
      to its protein partner(s) in the cell.

TI  - Prevalence of triplet repeat expansion in ataxia patients from Hokkaido, the 
      northernmost island of Japan.
PG  - 45-51
AB  - Approximately 44% of cases of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) in Hokkaido, the 
      northernmost island of Japan, were estimated to be inherited. To determine the 
      prevalence of triplet repeat expansion in hereditary SCA patients, we genotyped 
      seven genetically defined dominant SCAs in 349 patients, including 266 patients 
      from 77 families, 78 probands from unrelated families with hereditary late-onset 
      SCA, and five patients in whom a family history of SCA was not demonstrated. The 
      frequency of each disorder in a total of 155 unrelated families was 23.9% for 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), 29.0% for SCA6, 9.7% for SCA1, 7.7% for SCA2, and 
      2.6% for dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy. Abnormal expansion of triplet 
      repeats for SCA7 and SCA8 was not detected. A total of 27.1% of the patients had 
      still unknown SCA mutations. In addition, the GAA repeat in the frataxin gene was 
      not abnormally expanded in 13 early-onset SCA patients with clinical features 
      similar to those of Friedreich ataxia. Comparison of our results with those from 
      other centers handling SCA showed that MJD is prevalent throughout Japan, but the 
      frequencies of other dominant SCAs differ considerably even within Japan.

TI  - Frequency of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, SCA6, SCA7, and DRPLA CAG trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion in patients with hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia from Chinese 
      kindreds.
PG  - 540-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency of SCA1 (spinocerebellar ataxia type 1), SCA2, 
      SCA3/MJD (spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado-Joseph disease), SCA6, SCA7, and 
      DRPLA (dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy) CAG trinucleotide repeat expansions 
      [(CAG)n] among persons diagnosed with hereditary SCA from Chinese families. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, SCA6, SCA7, 
      and DRPLA (CAG)n mutation were detected with the polymerase chain reaction, 
      highly denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and silver staining 
      technique in 167 patients with autosomal dominant SCA from 85 Chinese families 
      and 37 patients with sporadic SCA. RESULTS: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (CAG)n 
      mutation in 7 patients from 4 kindreds (4.70%) was expanded to 53 to 62 repeats. 
      Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (CAG)n mutation in 12 patients from 5 kindreds 
      (5.88%) was expanded to 42 to 47 repeats. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      3/Machado-Joseph disease (CAG)n mutation in 83 patients from 41 kindreds (48.23%) 
      was expanded to 68 to 83 repeats. Sixty-five patients from 35 kindreds (41.19%) 
      and 37 patients with sporadic SCA did not test positive for SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, 
      SCA6, SCA7, or DRPLA. There was a predictable inverse relationship between the 
      number of CAG repeats and the age at onset for SCA3/MJD and SCA2. Clinically, 
      dementia and hyporeflexia were more frequent in patients with SCA2, while 
      spasticity, hyperreflexia, and Babinski signs were more frequent in patients with 
      SCA3/ MJD, and those might be helpful in clinical work to primarily distinguish 
      patients with SCA3/MJD and SCA2 from others with different types of SCA. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of SCA3/MJD is substantially higher than that of SCA1 
      and SCA2 in patients with autosomal dominant SCA from Chinese kindreds, who are 
      non-Portuguese. Clinical expressions of the various types of SCAs overlap one 
      another; therefore, for clinical study it is important to make a gene diagnosis 
      and genetic classification for patients with SCA.

TI  - Absence of unidentified CAG repeat expansion in patients with Huntington's 
      disease-like phenotype.
PG  - 672-5
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by an expanded (CAG)n repeat on the huntingtin gene. It is characterised 
      by motor, psychiatric and cognitive disturbances. Diagnosis can be confirmed by 
      direct genetic testing, which is highly sensitive and specific and is now 
      considered definitive. This study focused on 21 patients presenting with a 
      clinical phenotype showing strong similarity to HD, but who do not have an 
      expanded CAG in the huntingtin gene. However, other possible diagnoses could be 
      evoked for most of them. Seven patients (3.5% of our cohort) could be considered 
      as phenocopies of HD with no alternative diagnosis. Samples were screened for 
      other triplet repeat diseases with similar presentation (DRPLA, SCA-1, SCA-2, 
      SCA-3, SCA-6, and SCA-7) and were all negative. The repeat expansion detection 
      technique (RED) was used to detect uncloned CAG repeat expansions and samples 
      were also analysed by polymerase chain reaction for expansions of the polymorphic 
      CAG-ERDA-1 and CTG18.1 trinucleotide repeats. RED expansion (>40 repeats) was 
      detected in only one patient. The results suggest that unstable CAG/CTG repeat 
      expansions corresponding to known or unknown sequences are not involved in the 
      aetiology of HD-like disorders. It is hypothesised that some of these phenocopies 
      could correspond to mutations in other unidentified genes with other unstable 
      repeats (different from CAG) or in unknown genes with other mutations.

TI  - Multiple origins of the spinocerebellar ataxia 7 (SCA7) mutation revealed by 
      linkage disequilibrium studies with closely flanking markers, including an 
      intragenic polymorphism (G3145TG/A3145TG).
PG  - 889-96
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 7 (SCA7) is a neurodegenerative disease characterised by 
      the association of cerebellar ataxia and, in most patients, progressive macular 
      degeneration leading to loss of autonomy and blindness. The patients die after 
      5-30 years of evolution. The cause of the disease has been identified as a (CAG)n 
      repeat expansion in the coding sequence of the SCA7 gene on chromosome 3p. De 
      novo mutations occur on intermediate-sized alleles carrying from 28 to 35 CAG 
      repeats. Neomutations explain the persistence of the disease in spite of the 
      great instability of the repeat sequence which results in the appearance of 
      juvenile onset patients and the extinction of the disease within families. This 
      rare disorder has been reported in a wide variety of countries and ethnic groups. 
      In a large number of SCA7 families (n = 41) of different origins, we have 
      determined the haplotypes segregating with the mutation of several microsatellite 
      markers close to the SCA7 gene and of a new intragenic polymorphism 
      (G3145TG/A3145TG). Four different haplotypes were found for centromeric markers 
      (G3145TG/A3145TG-D3S1287-D3S3635) in the majority of the kindreds from four 
      different geographic regions: A-2-4 in Korea; A-3-6 in North Africa, B-3-6 in 
      continental Europe and A-4-6 in the UK and USA. The haplotypes in the Jamaican, 
      Filipino, Brazilian and German families were different, suggesting that 
      independent regional founders are at the origin of the SCA7 mutation in each 
      population. Two different haplotypes were observed, however, in two families from 
      the same rural area in central Italy in which de novo SCA7 mutations on 
      intermediate alleles have been observed, suggesting the existence of different 
      pools of at-risk chromosomes in this population.

TI  - Very large (CAG)(n) DNA repeat expansions in the sperm of two spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 7 males.
PG  - 2473-8
AB  - Genetic anticipation, i.e. increasing disease severity and decreasing age of 
      onset from one generation to the next, is observed in a number of diseases, 
      including myotonic dystrophy type 1, Huntington's disease and several of the 
      spinocerebellar ataxias. All of these disorders are associated with the expansion 
      of a trinucleotide repeat and array length is positively correlated with disease 
      severity and inversely correlated with the age of onset. The expanded repeat is 
      highly unstable and continues to expand from one generation to the next, 
      providing a molecular explanation for anticipation. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 
      (SCA7) is one of the latest additions to the list of triplet repeat diseases and 
      is distinct from the other SCAs in that it is accompanied by retinal 
      degeneration. Pedigree analyses have previously revealed that the SCA7 repeat is 
      highly unstable and liable to expand, in particular when transmitted by a male. 
      Surprisingly, though, an under-representation of male transmission has also been 
      reported. We now demonstrate directly by single molecule analyses that the 
      expanded repeat is extraordinarily unstable in the male germline and biased 
      toward massive increases. Nearly all of the mutant sperm of two SCA7 males 
      contain alleles that are so large that most of the affected offspring would at 
      best have a severe infantile form of the disease. Indeed, the gross 
      under-representation of such very large expanded alleles in patients suggests 
      that a significant proportion of such alleles might be associated with embryonic 
      lethality or dysfunctional sperm.

      individuals from 17 SCA7 kindreds and compared them with repeat lengths of 180 
      unaffected individuals. Subjects with abnormal expansions comprise 59 clinically 
      affected individuals and 14 at-risk currently unaffected individuals predicted to 
      carry the mutation by haplotype analysis. For expanded alleles, CAG repeat length 
      correlates with disease progression and severity and correlates inversely with 
      age of onset. Increased repeat lengths are seen in generational transmission of 
      the disease allele, consistent with the pattern of clinical anticipation seen in 
      these kindreds. Repeat lengths in expanded alleles show somatic mosaicism in 
      leukocyte DNA, suggesting that these alleles are unstable within individuals as 
      well as between generations. Although dynamic repeat expansions from paternal 
      transmissions are greater than those from maternal transmissions, maternal 
      transmission of disease is more common, suggesting germline or embryonic effects 
      of the repeat expansion.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) - correlations between phenotype and 
      genotype in one large Belgian family.
PG  - 37-46
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7), in which the degenerative process also 
      affect the retina, belongs to the category of the autosomal dominant cerebellar 
      ataxia type II (ADCA II). We have described the neuropathology of this condition 
      [Martin JJ, Van Regemorter N, Krols L, Brucher JM, de Barsy T, Szliwowski H, et 
      al. On an autosomal dominant form of retino-cerebellar degeneration: an autopsy 
      study of five patients in one family. Acta Neuropathol (Berl) 1994;88:277-286] in 
      a very large Belgian family (CA-1). We have observed anticipation in the age of 
      onset with increasing severity of the symptoms in consecutive generations. The 
      SCA7 gene was mapped to chromosome 3p12-13 [David G, Abbas N, Stevanin G, Durr A, 
      Yvert G, Cancel G, et al. Cloning of the SCA7 gene reveals a highly unstable CAG 
      repeat expansion. Nat Genet 1997;17:65-70; Del-Favero J, Krols L, Michalik A, 
      Theuns J, Lofgren A, Goossens D, et al. Molecular genetic analysis of autosomal 
      dominant cerebellar ataxia with retinal degeneration (ADCA type II) caused by CAG 
      triplet repeat expansion. Hum Mol Genet 1998;7:177-186], and the gene identified. 
      SCA7 is a new gene of unknown function that contains an expansion of CAG repeats 
      in SCA7 patients. During the procedure of positional cloning, we examined 26 
      patients belonging to the CA-1 family and realized, in some of them, an 
      ophthalmologic examination and neuro-imaging of the brain. This allowed us to 
      differentiate four groups: (1) asymptomatic young carriers with 38 to 43 CAG 
      repeats; (2) mildly symptomatic, older patients with 38-41 CAG repeats; (3) 
      patients with the full-blown picture of SCA7 and age of onset during adolescence, 
      with 54-55 CAG repeats; (4) children with early onset and rapid fatal course of 
      the disease who had over 55 CAG repeats. We were able to draw correlations 
      between clinical phenotype, age at onset and CAG repeat number and to make 
      predictions, to some extent, as to the clinical course of the disease in new 
      patients.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxias in Spanish patients: genetic analysis of familial and 
      sporadic cases. The Ataxia Study Group.
PG  - 516-22
AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) are a clinically heterogeneous group 
      of neurodegenerative disorders caused by unstable CAG repeat expansions encoding 
      polyglutamine tracts. Five spinocerebellar ataxia genes (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 
      and SCA7) and another related dominant ataxia gene (DRPLA) have been cloned, 
      allowing the genetic classification of these disorders. We present here the 
      molecular analysis of 87 unrelated familial and 60 sporadic Spanish cases of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia. For ADCA cases 15% were SCA2, 15% SCA3, 6% SCA1, 3% SCA7, 
      1% SCA6 and 1% DRPLA, an extremely rare mutation in Caucasoid populations. About 
      58% of ADCA cases remained genetically unclassified. All the SCA1 cases belong to 
      the same geographical area and share a common haplotype for the SCA1 mutation. 
      The expanded alleles ranged from 41 to 59 repeats for SCA1, 35 to 46 [corrected] 
      for SCA2, 67 to 77 for SCA3, and 38 to 113 for SCA7. One SCA6 case had 25 repeats 
      and one DRPLA case had 63 repeats. The highest CAG repeat variation in meiotic 
      transmission of expanded alleles was detected in SCA7, this being of +67 units in 
      one paternal transmission and giving rise to a 113 CAG repeat allele in a patient 
      who died at 3 years of age. Meiotic transmissions have also shown a tendency to 
      more frequent paternal transmission of expanded alleles in SCA1 and maternal in 
      SCA7. All SCA1 and SCA2 expanded alleles analyzed consisted of pure CAG repeats, 
      whereas normal alleles were interrupted by 1-2 CAT trinucleotides in SCA1, except 
      for three alleles of 6, 14 and 21 CAG repeats, and by 1-3 CAA trinucleotides in 
      SCA2. No SCA or DRPLA mutations were detected in the 60 sporadic cases of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia, but one late onset patient was identified as a recessive 
      form due to GAA-repeat expansions in the Friedreich's ataxia gene.

PG  - 1657-64
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) belongs to a group of neurological disorders 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the coding region of the associated gene. To 
      gain insight into the pathogenesis of SCA7 and possible functions of ataxin-7, we 
      examined the subcellular localization of ataxin-7 in transfected COS-1 cells 
      using SCA7 cDNA clones with different CAG repeat tract lengths. In addition to a 
      diffuse distribution throughout the nucleus, ataxin-7 associated with the nuclear 
      matrix and the nucleolus. The location of the putative SCA7 nuclear localization 
      sequence (NLS) was confirmed by fusing an ataxin-7 fragment with the normally 
      cytoplasmic protein chicken muscle pyruvate kinase. Mutation of this NLS 
      prevented protein from entering the nucleus. Thus, expanded ataxin-7 may carry 
      out its pathogenic effects in the nucleus by altering a matrix-associated nuclear 
      structure and/or by disrupting nucleolar function.

TI  - Mapping of a new autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia to chromosome 22.
PG  - 594-9
AB  - The autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) are a clinically and 
      genetically heterogeneous group of disorders. The clinical symptoms include 
      cerebellar dysfunction and associated signs from dysfunction in other parts of 
      the nervous system. So far, five spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) genes have been 
      identified: SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7. Loci for SCA4 and SCA5 have been 
      mapped. However, approximately one-third of SCAs have remained unassigned. We 
      have identified a Mexican American pedigree that segregates a new form of ataxia 
      clinically characterized by gait and limb ataxia, dysarthria, and nystagmus. Two 
      individuals have seizures. After excluding all known genetic loci for linkage, we 
      performed a genomewide search and identified linkage to a 15-cM region on 
      chromosome 22q13. A maximum LOD score of 4.3 (recombination fraction 0) was 
      obtained for D22S928 and D22S1161. This distinct form of ataxia has been 
      designated "SCA10." Anticipation was observed in the available parent-child 
      pairs, suggesting that trinucleotide-repeat expansion may be the mutagenic 
      mechanism.

TI  - Incidence of dominant spinocerebellar and Friedreich triplet repeats among 361 
      ataxia families.
PG  - 1666-71
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1, 2, 
      3, 6, and 7 and Friedreich's ataxia (FA) among a large panel of ataxia families. 
      BACKGROUND: The ataxias are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of 
      neurodegenerative diseases that variably affect the cerebellum, brainstem, and 
      spinocerebellar tracts. Trinucleotide repeat expansions have been shown to be the 
      mutational mechanism for five dominantly inherited SCAs as well as FA. METHODS: 
      We collected DNA samples and clinical data from patients representing 361 
      families with adult-onset ataxia of unknown etiology. Patients with a clinical 
      diagnosis of FA were specifically excluded from our collection. RESULTS: Among 
      the 178 dominant kindreds, we found SCA1 expansion at a frequency of 5.6%, SCA2 
      expansion at a frequency of 15.2%, SCA3 expansion at a frequency of 20.8%, SCA6 
      expansion at a frequency of 15.2%, and SCA7 expansion at a frequency of 4.5%. FA 
      alleles were found in 11.4% of apparently recessive and 5.2% of apparently 
      sporadic patients. Among these patients the repeat sizes for one or both FA 
      alleles were relatively small, with sizes for the smaller allele ranging from 90 
      to 600 GAA repeats. The clinical presentation for these patients is atypical for 
      FA, with one or more of the following characteristics: adult onset of disease, 
      retained tendon reflexes, normal plantar response, and intact or partially intact 
      sensory perceptions. CONCLUSIONS: Pathogenic trinucleotide repeat expansions were 
      found among 61% of the dominant kindreds. Among patients with apparently 
      recessive or negative family histories of ataxia, 6.8% and 4.4% tested positive 
      for a CAG expansion at one of the dominant loci, and 11.4 and 5.2% of patients 
      with apparently recessive or sporadic forms of ataxia had FA expansions. Because 
      of the significant implications that a dominant versus recessive inheritance 
      pattern has for future generations, it is important to screen patients who do not 
      have a clearly dominant inheritance pattern for expansions at both the FA and the 
      dominant ataxia loci.

TI  - De novo expansion of intermediate alleles in spinocerebellar ataxia 7.
PG  - 1809-13
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 7 (SCA7) is the eighth neurodegenerative disorder caused 
      by a translated CAG repeat expansion. Normal SCA7 alleles carry from four to 35 
      CAG repeats, whereas pathological alleles carry from 37 to approximately 200. 
      Intermediate alleles (IAs), with 28-35 repeats in the SCA7 gene are exceedingly 
      rare in the general population and are not associated with the SCA7 phenotype, 
      although they have been found among relatives of four SCA7 families. In two of 
      these families, IAs bearing 35 and 28 CAG repeats gave rise, during paternal 
      transmission, to SCA7 expansions of 57 and 47 repeats, respectively, that were 
      confirmed by haplotype reconstructions in one case and by inference in the other. 
      Furthermore, the four haplotypes segregating with IAs were identical to the 
      expanded alleles in each kindred, but differed among the families, indicating 
      multiple origins of the SCA7 mutation in these families with different 
      geographical origins. Our results provide the first evidence of de novo SCA7 
      expansions from IAs that are not associated with the phenotype but can expand to 
      the pathological range during some paternal transmissions. IAs that segregate in 
      unaffected branches of the pedigrees might, therefore, constitute a reservoir for 
      future de novo mutations that occur in a recurrent but random manner. This would 
      explain the persistence of the disease in spite of the great anticipation 
      (approximately 20 years/generation) characteristic of SCA7. So far, de novo 
      expansions among the disorders caused by polyglutamine repeats have only been 
      demonstrated in Huntington's disease.

TI  - Analysis of SCA1, DRPLA, MJD, SCA2, and SCA6 CAG repeats in 48 Portuguese ataxia 
      families.
PG  - 134-8
AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are clinically and genetically a heterogeneous 
      group of neurodegenerative disorders. To date, eight different loci causing SCA 
      have been identified: SCA1, SCA2, Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)/SCA3, SCA4, SCA5, 
      SCA6, SCA7, and dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). Expansion of a CAG 
      repeat in the disease genes has been found in five of these disorders. To 
      estimate the relative frequencies of the SCA1, DRPLA, MJD, SCA2, and SCA6 
      mutations among Portuguese ataxia patients, we collected DNA samples from 48 
      ataxia families and performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of 
      the CAG repeat mutations on chromosomes 6p, 12p, 14q, 12q, and 19p, respectively. 
      Fifty-five individuals belonging to 34 dominant families (74%) had an expanded 
      CAG repeat at the MJD gene. In five individuals from two kindreds with a dominant 
      pattern of inheritance (4%), an expanded CAG repeat at the SCA2 gene was found. 
      In MJD patients, the normal allele size ranged from 13 to 41, whereas the mutant 
      alleles contained 65 to 80 repeats. For the SCA2 patients, normal alleles had 22 
      or 23, while expanded alleles had between 36 and 47 CAG units. We did not find 
      the SCA1, DRPLA, or SCA6 mutations in our group of families. The MJD mutation 
      remains the most common cause of SCA in Portugal, while a small number of cases 
      are caused by mutations at the SCA2 gene, and 22% are due to still unidentified 
      genes.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7): a neurodegenerative disorder with neuronal 
      intranuclear inclusions.
PG  - 913-8
AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia with progressive macular degeneration is 
      caused by a CAG/glutamine repeat expansion in the SCA7 gene/protein. Neuronal 
      intranuclear inclusions were detected in the brain of an early onset SCA7 case 
      with the 1C2 antibody directed against an expanded polyglutamine domain. Nuclear 
      inclusions were most frequent in the inferior olivary complex, a site of severe 
      neuronal loss in SCA7. They were also observed in other brain regions, including 
      the cerebral cortex, not considered to be affected in the disease. Using confocal 
      microscopy we showed that some inclusions were ubiquitinated, but to varying 
      degrees, ranging from <1% in the cerebral cortex to 60% in the inferior olive. In 
      addition, we also observed cytoplasmic staining using the 1C2 antibody, 
      particularly in the supramarginal gyrus, the hippocampus, the thalamus, the 
      lateral geniculate body and the pontine nuclei. These data confirm that the 
      presence of intranuclear inclusions in neurons is a common characteristic of 
      disorders caused by CAG/polyglutamine expansions, but unlike what has been 
      reported for Huntington's disease, SCA1 and SCA3/MJD, in SCA7 the inclusions were 
      not restricted to the sites of severe neuronal loss.

TI  - Molecular genetic analysis of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia with retinal 
      degeneration (ADCA type II) caused by CAG triplet repeat expansion.
PG  - 177-86
AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia with retinal degeneration (ADCAII) was 
      previously mapped by linkage analysis studies to chromosome 3p12-p21.1 (SCA7). 
      Positional cloning efforts have recently identified a novel gene, SCA7 , 
      containing a translated CAG repeat, expanded in SCA7 patients. We cloned the SCA7 
      gene from a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clone contig spanning the SCA7 
      candidate region. Using a combination of genomic sequencing and cosmid-based exon 
      trapping, two expressed sequence tags were identified. Sequencing of the 
      corresponding cDNA clones and RT-PCR analysis identified the full-length SCA7 
      cDNA. Together, our sequence data defined the intron/exon boundaries of the first 
      two coding exons of the SCA7 gene, with the first exon containing the expanded 
      CAG repeat. Further, sequence comparison with the published SCA7 cDNA identified 
      one additional putative exon in the 5'-UTR region of the SCA7 gene. The SCA7 gene 
      was mapped on the YAC contig in the 2.5 cM interval between D3S1600 and D3S1287. 
      In one extended Belgian SCA7 pedigree the expanded alleles ranged from 38 to at 
      least 55 repeats with allele lengths being inversely correlated with onset age of 
      ADCAII symptoms. The SCA7 repeats increased in length in successive generations. 
      Normal alleles had from four to 18 repeats, with 10 repeats being the most common 
      allele.

TI  - Expanded CAG repeats in Swedish spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) patients: 
      effect of CAG repeat length on the clinical manifestation.
PG  - 171-6
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 7 (SCA7) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by 
      degeneration of the cerebellum, brainstem and retina. The gene responsible for 
      SCA7, located on chromosome 3p, recently was cloned and shown to contain a CAG 
      repeat in the coding region of the gene, that is expanded in SCA7 patients of 
      French origin. We examined the SCA7 repeat region in four Swedish SCA7 families 
      as well as in 57 healthy controls. All Swedish SCA7 patients exhibited expanded 
      CAG repeats with a strong negative correlation between repeat size and age of 
      onset. The repeat length in SCA7 patients ranged from 40 to >200 repeats. The 
      largest expansion was observed in a juvenile case with an age of onset of 3 
      months, and represents the longest polyglutamine stretch ever reported. In 
      patients with 59 repeats or more, visual impairment was the most common initial 
      symptom observed, while ataxia predominates in patients with <59 repeats. Two of 
      the Swedish SCA7 families analysed in this study were shown to be related 
      genealogically. The other two SCA7 families could not be traced back to a common 
      ancestor. All four families shared the same allele on the disease chromosome at a 
      locus closely linked to SCA7, suggesting the possibility of a founder effect in 
      the Swedish population.

TI  - Molecular and clinical correlations in autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia with 
      progressive macular dystrophy (SCA7).
PG  - 165-70
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 7 (SCA7) is caused by the expansion of an unstable CAG 
      repeat in the first exon of the SCA7 gene. We have analyzed the SCA7 mutation in 
      19 families and one isolated case of various geographical origins, presenting 
      with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia with progressive macular dystrophy. The 
      SCA7 CAG repeat was expanded in 77 patients and in 11 at-risk individuals, with 
      alleles containing from 37 to 130 repeats, demonstrating that SCA7 is genetically 
      homogeneous. Repeats on normal alleles contained from 7 to 35 CAGs. There was a 
      strong negative correlation (r = -0.84) between the age at onset and the size of 
      the CAG repeat expansion in SCA7 patients. Larger expansions were associated with 
      earlier onset, a more severe and rapid clinical course, and a higher frequency of 
      decreased vision, ophthalmoplegia, extensor plantar response and scoliosis. The 
      frequency of other clinical signs such as dysphagia and sphincter disturbances 
      increased with disease duration. The mutation was highly unstable during 
      transmission, with a mean increase of 10 +/- 16 CAG repeats, which was 
      significantly greater in paternal (15 +/- 20) than in maternal (5 +/- 5) 
      transmissions. This correlated well with the marked anticipation (19 +/- 13 
      years) observed in the families. Gonadal mosaicism, observed in the sperm of a 
      patient, was particularly important, with expanded alleles ranging from 42 to 
      >155 CAG repeats. The degree of instability during transmission, resulting mostly 
      in expansions, is greater than in the seven other neurodegenerative disorders 
      caused by polyglutamine expansions.

TI  - Rapid cloning of expanded trinucleotide repeat sequences from genomic DNA.
PG  - 72-5
AB  - Trinucleotide repeat expansions have been shown to cause a number of 
      neurodegenerative diseases. A hallmark of most of these diseases is the presence 
      of anticipation, a decrease in the age at onset in consecutive generations due to 
      the tendency of the unstable trinucleotide repeat to lengthen when passed from 
      one generation to the next. The involvement of trinucleotide repeat expansions in 
      a number of other diseases--including familial spastic paraplegia, schizophrenia, 
      bipolar affective disorder and spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7; ref. 10)--is 
      suggested both by the presence of anticipation and by repeat expansion detection 
      (RED) analysis of genomic DNA samples. The involvement of trinucleotide 
      expansions in these diseases, however, can be conclusively confirmed only by the 
      isolation of the expansions present in these populations and detailed analysis to 
      assess each expansion as a possible pathogenic mutation. We describe a novel 
      procedure for quick isolation of expanded trinucleotide repeats and the 
      corresponding flanking nucleotide sequence directly from small amounts of genomic 
      DNA by a process of Repeat Analysis, Pooled Isolation and Detection of individual 
      clones containing expanded trinucleotide repeats (RAPID cloning). We have used 
      this technique to clone the pathogenic SCA7 CAG expansion from an archived DNA 
      sample of an individual affected with ataxia and retinal degeneration.

TI  - Polymorphisms at 13 expressed human sequences containing CAG/CTG repeats and 
      analysis in autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) patients.
PG  - 18-21
AB  - Genetic anticipation--increasing severity and a decrease in the age of onset with 
      successive generations of a pedigree--is clearly present in autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxia (ADCA). Anticipation is correlated with expansion of the 
      CAG/CTG repeat sequence to sizes above those in the normal range through the 
      generations of a pedigree. Genetic heterogeneity has been demonstrated for ADCA, 
      with four cloned genes (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, and SCA6) and three mapped loci 
      (SCA4, SCA5 and SCA7). Another related dominant ataxia, 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), presents anticipation with CAG/CTG 
      repeat expansions. We had previously analysed ADCA patients who had not shown 
      repeat expansions in cloned genes for CAG/CTG repeat expansions by the repeat 
      expansion detection method (RED) and had detected expansions of between 48 and 88 
      units in 17 unrelated familial cases. We present here an analysis of 13 genes and 
      expressed sequence tags (ESTs) containing 10 or more CAG/CTG repeat sequences 
      selected from public databases in the 17 unrelated ADCA patients. Of the 13 
      selected genes and ESTs, 9 were found to be polymorphic with heterozygosities 
      ranging between 0.09 and 0.80 and 2 to 17 alleles. In ADCA patients none of the 
      loci showed expansions above the normal range of the CAG/CTG repeat sequences, 
      excluding them as the mutation causing ADCA.

TI  - Cloning of the SCA7 gene reveals a highly unstable CAG repeat expansion.
PG  - 65-70
AB  - The gene for spinocerebellar ataxia 7 (SCA7) has been mapped to chromosome 
      3p12-13. By positional cloning, we have identified a new gene of unknown function 
      containing a CAG repeat that is expanded in SCA7 patients. On mutated alleles, 
      CAG repeat size is highly variable, ranging from 38 to 130 repeats, whereas on 
      normal alleles it ranges from 7 to 17 repeats. Gonadal instability in SCA7 is 
      greater than that observed in any of the seven known neuro-degenerative diseases 
      caused by translated CAG repeat expansions, and is markedly associated with 
      paternal transmissions. SCA7 is the first such disorder in which the degenerative 
      process also affects the retina.

TI  - Estimated contribution of known ataxia genes in ataxia patients undergoing DNA 
      testing.
PG  - 275-8
AB  - We estimated the relative contributions of known ataxia genes (SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7 
      and X25) in the patient population sent to our DNA diagnostic laboratory for 
      diagnostic testing. Approximately 28% of these patients had an abnormal triplet 
      repeat expansion in one of these ataxia genes (3% for SCA1, 8% for SCA2, 11% for 
      SCA3/MJD, 2% for SCA6, 3% for SCA7, and 1.5% for X25). The lack of abnormal 
      repeat expansions in the majority of ataxis patients tested suggests that the 
      molecular defects associated with most ataxia cases are currently undetermined 
      and that this population includes both familial and sporadic cases. In contrast, 
      of the patients submitted for genetic testing for Friedrich's ataxia (FRDA), 44% 
      (69/157) showed at least one expansion in the X25 gene, indicating that FRDA 
      accounts for a significant proportion of the recessively inherited ataxias and 
      appears to have a high rate of accurate clinical diagnosis. On the basis of our 
      DNA studies, we propose a comprehensive and efficient approach for molecular 
      analysis of ataxia patients.

TI  - An expanded CAG repeat sequence in spinocerebellar ataxia type 7.
PG  - 965-71
AB  - Expanded CAG repeat sequences have been identified in the coding region of genes 
      mutated in several neurodegenerative disorders, including spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 1 and Machado-Joseph disease. In all disorders described to date the CAG 
      expansion codes for an elongated polyglutamine chain. An increased polyglutamine 
      chain size leads to a more severe disease, thus correlating with the genetic 
      anticipation seen in repeat expansion disorders. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 
      (SCA7) is an autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia with anticipation and a 
      progressive degeneration of the cerebellar cortex. Using repeat expansion 
      detection (RED), a method in which a thermostable ligase is used to detect repeat 
      expansions directly from genomic DNA, we have analyzed 8 SCA7 families for the 
      presence of CAG repeat expansions. RED products of 150-240 bp were found in all 
      affected individuals and found to cosegregate with the disease (P < 0.000001, n = 
      66), indicating strongly that a CAG expansion is the cause of SCA7. On the basis 
      of a previously established correlation between RED product sizes and actual 
      repeat sizes in Machado-Joseph disease, we were able to estimate the average 
      expansion size in SCA7 to be 64 CAG copies.
