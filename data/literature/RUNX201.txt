AB  - BACKGROUND: Periodontitis is a chronic infectious disease of periodontal support 
      tissue caused by microorganisms in dental plaque, which causes alveolar bone 
      resorption and tooth loss. Periodontitis treatment goals include prevention of 
      alveolar bone resorption and promotion of periodontal regeneration. We previously 
      found that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was involved in 
      periodontitis-related alveolar bone resorption through induction of an immune 
      response and subsequent destruction of periodontal tissue. However, the 
      mechanisms underlying the effects of G-CSF on abnormal bone remodeling have not 
      yet been fully elucidated. Human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs) are 
      major modulators of osteogenic differentiation in periodontal tissues. Thus, the 
      aim of this study was to investigated whether G-CSF acts effects on hPDLSC 
      proliferation and osteogenic differentiation, as well as periodontal tissue 
      repair. METHODS: hPDLSCs were cultured and identified by short tandem repeat 
      analysis. The expression patterns and locations of G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR) on 
      hPDLSCs were detected by immunofluorescence analysis. The effects of G-CSF on 
      hPDLSCs in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory microenvironment were 
      investigated. Specifically, Cell-Counting Kit 8 (CCK8) and Alizarin red staining 
      were used to examine hPDLSC proliferation and osteogenic differentiation; reverse 
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect the expression 
      patterns of osteogenesis-related genes (alkaline phosphatase [ALP], runt-related 
      transcription factor 2 [Runx2], and osteocalcin [OCN]) in hPDLSCs; and Western 
      blotting was used to detect the expression patterns of phosphatidylinositol 
      3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (Akt) of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. 
      RESULTS: hPDLSCs exhibited a typical spindle-shaped morphology and good 
      clonogenic ability. G-CSFR was mostly localized on the cell surface membrane. 
      Analyses showed that G-CSF inhibited hPDLSC proliferation. Also, in the 
      LPS-induced inflammatory microenvironment, G-CSF inhibited hPDLSC osteogenic 
      differentiation and reduced the expression levels of osteogenesis-related genes. 
      G-CSF increased the protein expression levels of hPDLSC pathway components p-PI3K 
      and p-Akt. CONCLUSIONS: We found that G-CSFR was expressed on hPDLSCs. 
      Furthermore, G-CSF inhibited hPDLSC osteogenic differentiation in vitro in the 
      LPS-induced inflammatory microenvironment.

TI  - Osmolarity modulates the de-differentiation of horse articular chondrocytes 
      during cell expansion in vitro: implications for tissue engineering in cartilage 
      repair.
PG  - 2285-2292

AB  - Due to the importance of joint disease and ostearthritis (OA) in equine athletes, 
      new regenerative treatments to improve articular cartilage repair after damage 
      are gaining relevance. Chondrocyte de-differentiation, an important pathogenetic 
      mechanism in OA, is a limiting factor when differentiated articular chondrocytes 
      are used for cell-based therapies. Current research focuses on the prevention of 
      this de-differentiation and/or on the re-differentiation of chondrocytes by 
      employing different strategies in vitro and in vivo. Articular chondrocytes 
      normally live in a condition of higher osmolarity (350-450 mOsm/L) compared to 
      normal physiological fluids (~ 300 mOsm/L) and some studies have demonstrated 
      that osmolarity has a chondroprotective effect in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, 
      the response of horse articular chondrocytes to osmolarity changes (280, 380, and 
      480 mOsm/L) was studied both in proliferating, de-differentiated chondrocytes 
      grown in adhesion, and in differentiated chondrocytes grown in a 3D culture 
      system. To this aim, cell proliferation (cell counting), morphology (optical 
      microscopy), and differentiation (gene expression of specific markers) were 
      monitored along with the expression of osmolyte transporters involved in volume 
      regulation [betaine-GABA transporter (BGT-1), taurine transporter (SLC6A6), and 
      neutral amino acid transporter (SNAT)] real-time qPCR. Proliferating chondrocytes 
      cultured under hyperosmolar conditions showed low proliferation, spheroidal 
      morphology, a significant reduction of de-differentiation markers [collagen type 
      I (Col1) and RUNX2] and an increase of differentiation markers [collagen type II 
      (Col2) and aggrecan]. Notably, a persistently high level of BGT-1 gene expression 
      was maintained in chondrocyte cultures at 380 mOsm/L, and particularly at 480 
      mOsm/L both in proliferating and differentiated chondrocytes. These preliminary 
      data encourage the study of osmolarity as a microenvironmental co-factor to 
      promote/maintain chondrocyte differentiation in both 2D and 3D in vitro culture 
      systems.

AB  - Expansions of amino acid repeats occur in >20 inherited human disorders, and many 
      occur in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of transcription factors (TFs). 
      Such diseases are associated with protein aggregation, but the contribution of 
      aggregates to pathology has been controversial. Here, we report that alanine 
      repeat expansions in the HOXD13 TF, which cause hereditary synpolydactyly in 
      humans, alter its phase separation capacity and its capacity to co-condense with 
      transcriptional co-activators. HOXD13 repeat expansions perturb the composition 
      of HOXD13-containing condensates in vitro and in vivo and alter the 
      transcriptional program in a cell-specific manner in a mouse model of 
      synpolydactyly. Disease-associated repeat expansions in other TFs (HOXA13, RUNX2, 
      and TBP) were similarly found to alter their phase separation. These results 
      suggest that unblending of transcriptional condensates may underlie human 
      pathologies. We present a molecular classification of TF IDRs, which provides a 
      framework to dissect TF function in diseases associated with transcriptional 
      dysregulation.

TI  - Characterisation of novel RUNX2 mutation with alanine tract expansion from 
      Japanese cleidocranial dysplasia patient.
PG  - 61-7
LID - 10.1093/mutage/gev057 [doi]
AB  - Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD; MIM 119600) is an autosomal dominant skeletal 
      dysplasia characterised by hypopalstic and/or aplastic clavicles, midface 
      hypoplasia, absent or delayed closure of cranial sutures, moderately short 
      stature, delayed eruption of permanent dentition and supernumerary teeth. The 
      molecular pathogenesis can be explained in about two-thirds of CCD patients by 
      haploinsufficiency of the RUNX2 gene. In our current study, we identified a novel 
      and rare variant of the RUNX2 gene (c.181_189dupGCGGCGGCT) in a Japanese patient 
      with phenotypic features of CCD. The insertion led an alanine tripeptide 
      expansion (+3Ala) in the polyalanine tract. To date, a RUNX2 variant with alanine 
      decapeptide expansion (+10Ala) is the only example of a causative variant of 
      RUNX2 with polyalanine tract expansion to be reported, whilst RUNX2 (+1Ala) has 
      been isolated from the healthy population. Thus, precise analyses of the RUNX2 
      (+3Ala) variant were needed to clarify whether the tripeptide expanded RUNX2 is a 
      second disease-causing mutant with alanine tract expansion. We therefore 
      investigated the biochemical properties of the mutant RUNX2 (+3Ala), which 
      contains 20 alanine residues in the polyalanine tract. When transfected in COS7 
      cells, RUNX2 (+3Ala) formed intracellular ubiquitinated aggregates after 24h, and 
      exerted a dominant negative effect in vitro. At 24h after gene transfection, 
      whereas slight reduction was observed in RUNX2 (+10Ala), all of these mutants 
      significantly activated osteoblast-specific element-2, a cis-acting sequence in 
      the promoter of the RUNX2 target gene osteocalcin. The aggregation growth of 
      RUNX2 (+3Ala) was clearly lower and slower than that of RUNX2 (+10Ala). 
      Furthermore, we investigated several other RUNX2 variants with various alanine 
      tract lengths, and found that the threshold for aggregation may be RUNX2 (+3Ala). 
      We conclude that RUNX2 (+3Ala) is the cause of CCD in our current case, and that 
      the accumulation of intracellular aggregates in vitro is related to the length of 
      the alanine tract.

AB  - The expansion of homopolymeric glutamine (polyQ) or alanine (polyA) repeats in 
      certain proteins owing to genetic mutations induces protein aggregation and 
      toxicity, causing at least 18 human diseases. PolyQ and polyA repeats can also 
      associate in the same proteins, but the general extent of their association in 
      proteomes is unknown. Furthermore, the structural mechanisms by which their 
      expansion causes disease are not well understood, and these repeats are generally 
      thought to misfold upon expansion into aggregation-prone beta-sheet structures like 
      amyloids. However, recent evidence indicates a critical role for coiled-coil (CC) 
      structures in triggering aggregation and toxicity of polyQ-expanded proteins, 
      raising the possibility that polyA repeats may as well form these structures, by 
      themselves or in association with polyQ. We found through bioinformatics 
      screenings that polyA, polyQ and polyQA repeats have a phylogenetically graded 
      association in human and non-human proteomes and associate/overlap with CC 
      domains. Circular dichroism and cross-linking experiments revealed that polyA 
      repeats can form--alone or with polyQ and polyQA--CC structures that increase in 
      stability with polyA length, forming higher-order multimers and polymers in 
      vitro. Using structure-guided mutagenesis, we studied the relevance of polyA CCs 
      to the in vivo aggregation and toxicity of RUNX2--a polyQ/polyA protein 
      associated with cleidocranial dysplasia upon polyA expansion--and found that the 
      stability of its polyQ/polyA CC controls its aggregation, localization and 
      toxicity. These findings indicate that, like polyQ, polyA repeats form CC 
      structures that can trigger protein aggregation and toxicity upon expansion in 
      human genetic diseases.

AB  - RUNX2 is an essential transcription factor required for skeletal development and 
      cartilage formation. Haploinsufficiency of RUNX2 leads to cleidocranial 
      displaysia (CCD) a skeletal disorder characterised by gross dysgenesis of bones 
      particularly those derived from intramembranous bone formation. A notable feature 
      of the RUNX2 protein is the polyglutamine and polyalanine (23Q/17A) domain coded 
      by a repeat sequence. Since none of the known mutations causing CCD characterised 
      to date map in the glutamine repeat region, we hypothesised that Q-repeat 
      mutations may be related to a more subtle bone phenotype. We screened subjects 
      derived from four normal populations for Q-repeat variants. A total of 22 
      subjects were identified who were heterozygous for a wild type allele and a 
      Q-repeat variant allele: (15Q, 16Q, 18Q and 30Q). Although not every subject had 
      data for all measures, Q-repeat variants had a significant deficit in BMD with an 
      average decrease of 0.7SD measured over 12 BMD-related parameters (p = 0.005). 
      Femoral neck BMD was measured in all subjects (-0.6SD, p = 0.0007). The 
      transactivation function of RUNX2 was determined for 16Q and 30Q alleles using a 
      reporter gene assay. 16Q and 30Q alleles displayed significantly lower 
      transactivation function compared to wild type (23Q). Our analysis has identified 
      novel Q-repeat mutations that occur at a collective frequency of about 0.4%. 
      These mutations significantly alter BMD and display impaired transactivation 
      function, introducing a new class of functionally relevant RUNX2 mutants.

TI  - Runx2 contributes to murine Col10a1 gene regulation through direct interaction 
      with its cis-enhancer.
PG  - 2899-910
LID - 10.1002/jbmr.504 [doi]
AB  - We have recently shown that a 150-bp Col10a1 distal promoter (-4296 to -4147 bp) 
      is sufficient to direct hypertrophic chondrocyte-specific reporter (LacZ) 
      expression in vivo. More recently, through detailed sequence analysis we 
      identified two putative tandem-repeat Runx2 binding sites within the 3'-end of 
      this 150-bp region (TGTGGG-TGTGGC, -4187 to -4176 bp). Candidate electrophoretic 
      mobility shift assay (EMSA), chromatin immunoprecipitation, and transfection 
      studies demonstrate that these putative Runx2 sites bind Runx2 and mediate 
      upregulated Col10a1/reporter activity in vitro. Transgenic studies using the 
      5'-sequence without Runx2 sites were not able to drive the cell-specific LacZ 
      reporter activity, suggesting the in vivo requirement of the Runx2 sites located 
      in the 3'-end in mediating Col10a1/reporter expression. Indeed, mutating the 
      Runx2 sites in the context of the 150-bp promoter abolishes its capacity to drive 
      hypertrophic chondrocyte-specific reporter expression in transgenic mice. We have 
      also generated multiple transgenic mouse lines using only the 3'-sequence 
      containing the Runx2 sites to drive the LacZ gene. Interestingly, no hypertrophic 
      chondrocyte-specific blue staining was observed in these transgenic mice. 
      Together, our data support that Runx2 directly interacts with murine Col10a1 
      cis-enhancer. This interaction is required but not sufficient for cell-specific 
      Col10a1 promoter activity in vivo. Additional cooperative/repressive elements 
      within the 5'- or 3'-sequences of this 150-bp promoter are needed to work with 
      Runx2 together to mediate cell-specific Col10a1 expression. Further delineation 
      of these elements/factors has the potential to identify novel therapeutic targets 
      for multiple skeletal disorders, including osteoarthritis, that show abnormal 
      Col10a1 expression and altered chondrocyte maturation.

AB  - Mechanical stress is known to modulate postnatal skeletal growth and development. 
      However, the mechanisms underlying the mechanotransduction are not fully 
      understood. Polycystin-1 (PC1) is a promising candidate among proteins that may 
      play a role in the process as it has been shown to function as a flow sensor in 
      renal epithelium and it is known to be important for skeletal development. To 
      investigate whether PC1 is involved in mechanotransduction in skeletal tissues, 
      mice with a conditional deficiency for PC1 in neural crest cells, osteoblasts or 
      chondrocytes were subjected to midpalatal suture expansion. Dynamic bone labeling 
      revealed that new bone formation in response to expansion was significantly 
      reduced in Wnt1Cre;Pkd1 mice, as the suture area containing new bone was 
      14.0+/-3.4% in mutant mice versus 65.0+/-3.8% in control mice at 2 weeks 
      (p<0.001). In contrast, stress-induced new bone formation was not affected in 
      OsxCre;Pkd1 mice. The increase in cell proliferation and differentiation into 
      osteoblasts, seen in wild-type mice 1 day after force delivery, was not observed 
      until 14 days in Wnt1Cre;Pkd1 mice. TUNEL labeling showed a significant increase 
      in apoptotic suture cells at days 1 and 3 (from 7.0+/-0.5% to 13.5+/-1.4% at day 
      1 and from 4.6+/-1.1% to 10.5+/-1.7% at day 3, p<0.05). Abnormal ossification of 
      nasal cartilage of Wnt1Cre;Pkd1 mice was accelerated upon suture expansion. Such 
      ossification was also observed, but to a lesser extent in Col2a1-ERCre;Pkd1 mice. 
      Transcript levels of Runx2 and MMP13 were significantly increased in the nasal 
      cartilage of Wnt1Cre;Pkd1 mice compared to controls (p<0.05 and p<0.001, 
      respectively), and in mutant mice with expansion versus without expansion (p<0.05 
      and p<0.001, respectively). Lack of PC1 in chondroprogenitor cells also resulted 
      in increased cell apoptosis and an altered arrangement of chondrocytes in nasal 
      cartilage. These results indicate that PC1 plays a critical role in the response 
      of osteochondroprogenitor cells to the mechanical tissue stress induced by 
      midpalatal suture expansion. They also suggest that the combination of an in vivo 
      mechanical model, such as midpalatal suture expansion, with conditional 
      deficiency for proteins that play a role in mechanotransduction, represents a 
      powerful experimental strategy to explore underlying mechanisms.
