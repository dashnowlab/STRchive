AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study was designed to evaluate and contrast the volumetric 
      changes occurring within the nasal cavity (NC) and maxillary sinuses (MS) in 
      patients during growth periods with Class III malocclusion, treated with either 
      face mask (FM) or FM with rapid maxillary expansion (RME) treatment, utilizing 
      cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pre-treatment (T0) 
      and post-treatment (T1) cone beam computed tomography scans of 38 growing Class 
      III patients (21 females, 17 males) treated with FM and FM/RME were determined 
      and allocated into two groups: The FM/RME (11 females, 8 males; mean age, 
      11.71 +/- 1.145 years) and the FM group (10 females, 9 males; mean age, 
      11.75 +/- 1.021 years). The volumes of NC, right maxillary sinus (R-MS), left 
      maxillary sinus (L-MS) and total maxillary sinus (T-MS) were measured at two time 
      points: T0 and T1. RESULTS: At the beginning of treatment(T0), there was no 
      difference in the volumes of NC, R-MS, L-MS, T-MS in both FM and FM/RME groups. 
      Both groups (FM/RME and FM) showed statistically significant increases in all 
      volumetric measurements (NC, R-MS, L-MS, T-MS). In the comparison between the 
      groups, a statistically significant difference was observed only in the NC 
      measurement, while no significant differences were found in the other 
      measurements (MS, L-MS, T-MS). CONCLUSIONS: Both FM and FM/RME are effective 
      treatment modalities for increasing NC and MS volumes. FM/RME is a more effective 
      treatment protocol for increasing NC volume.

TI  - Long-read sequencing identifies ATXN3 repeat expansions, and transcriptomics 
      reveals disease progression biomarkers and druggable targets for spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 3.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hereditary ataxias (HAs) are neurodegenerative disorders 
      characterized by progressive cerebellar degeneration, with autosomal dominant 
      spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) representing the most prevalent subtype. SCA3, the 
      most common form worldwide, is caused by CAG repeat expansions in ATXN3, 
      resulting in pathogenic ataxin-3 aggregation. However, the underlying molecular 
      mechanisms driving disease progression remain incompletely understood. METHODS: 
      We utilized an integrated multi-omics strategy to investigate a five-generation 
      Chinese HA pedigree. Genetic analyses included targeted ataxia panel sequencing 
      (TS), whole-exome sequencing (WES), and long-read whole-genome sequencing 
      (LR-WGS) of blood-derived DNA to identify causal variants and confirm diagnosis. 
      Transcriptomic profiling revealed disease-associated gene expression signatures, 
      followed by functional annotation and cross-species validation. To ensure 
      analytical rigor, we further validated our bioinformatic pipeline using an 
      independent ulcerative colitis (UC) dataset. RESULTS: Genetic analysis identified 
      pathogenic ATXN3-CAG repeat expansions that co-segregated with clinical symptoms 
      in affected family members. Transcriptomic profiling showed significant 
      enrichment in ECM-receptor interaction and focal adhesion pathways, along with 
      immune dysregulation and RNA splicing defects associated with disease 
      progression. Cross-species analysis discovered conserved blood biomarkers 
      (C3/ALS2/SLC35A2 downward arrow and THBS1/CAMTA1 upward arrow), strongly correlated with clinical 
      progression. Protein-protein interaction network emphasized AKT1 as a central 
      regulator, along with other key hubs (e.g., TGFB1, MAPK3, CALM3, APP), while 
      brain-specific analyses highlighted Mobp, Mal, Gja1 and Klk6 as potential 
      therapeutic targets. CONCLUSIONS: This study genetically confirms SCA3 in a 
      Chinese pedigree using LR-WGS, overcoming the diagnostic limitations of 
      short-read sequencing. Comprehensive analyses revealed conserved SCA3 progression 
      signatures with potential biomarkers for future non-invasive monitoring. 
      Mechanistically, this study identified dysregulation in ECM-receptor 
      interaction/focal adhesion, immune response, and RNA splicing as key pathogenic 
      contributors. These findings provide both actionable therapeutic targets and 
      demonstrate the clinical utility of integrated multi-omics approaches for SCA3 
      diagnosis and patient stratification, with broader implications for repeat 
      expansion disorders. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Not Applicable.

      congenital progressive universal melanosis.

AB  - Hyperpigmentation presents a diverse clinical spectrum, largely influenced by 
      genetic factors that remain incompletely understood. The present study describes 
      a case of monozygotic twin girls aged 15 years with congenital progressive 
      universal melanosis (CPUM) born to non-consanguineous unaffected parents. CPUM 
      represents a novel clinical entity characterized by progressive widespread 
      hyperpigmentation beginning at birth, without other accompanying symptoms. Skin 
      biopsy and histopathological analysis were performed, followed by long-read 
      whole-genome sequencing and short tandem repeat analysis. Gene expression was 
      evaluated using reverse transcription-PCR, and protein levels were assessed by 
      western blotting in cultured skin fibroblasts from the twins and unaffected 
      controls. Long-read genome sequencing revealed a biallelic GATGGT repeat 
      expansion of 210-259 repeat units within the third intron of the thymidylate 
      synthase (TYMS) gene in both twins, whereas their parents were heterozygous. 
      Controls (n=236), derived from the in-house long-read sequencing database at 
      Excellence Center for Genomics and Precision Medicine, King Chulalongkorn 
      Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, carried the GATGGT repeat in the 42-172 
      range. No single nucleotide or structural variants or copy number variations were 
      present in both affected individuals and absent in the unaffected parents. RNA 
      and protein levels of TYMS using cultured skin fibroblasts from both twins showed 
      no discernible differences compared with controls. Fibroblasts were used due to 
      their accessibility via skin biopsy and their role in skin pigmentation through 
      paracrine signaling to melanocytes. More relevant cells, such as melanocytes or 
      keratinocytes, may be required to exhibit such changes, as these cells are 
      directly involved in melanin production and skin pigmentation. TYMS is implicated 
      in skin pigmentation in normal physiological process and in disorders manifesting 
      abnormal skin pigmentation, such as dyskeratosis congenita. The present findings 
      imply a connection between the identified repeat expansion in TYMS and CPUM, 
      underscoring the need for further investigations to elucidate its causal 
      association.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The present research was designed to study the associations between 
      genetic variants of TYMS and ENOSF1 genes with TYMS and ENOSF1 gene expression in 
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy response among patients with gastric cancer. METHODS: 
      Formalin-embedded and paraffin-fixed matched tumor and normal gastric cancer 
      tissue samples from patients who received neoadjuvant 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 
      treatment were obtained. DNA and RNA were extracted for all samples. A 28-bp 
      variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) at the 5' untranslated region of TYMS gene 
      and rs2612091 and rs2741171 variants in the ENOSF1 gene were genotyped for normal 
      tissue samples. The real-time polymerase chain reaction method was used to study 
      the expression of ENOSF1 and TYMS genes in both normal and tumor tissues. Data 
      were analyzed using REST 2000 and SPSS ver. 26.0 software programs. RESULTS: A 
      significant association between TYMS 2R3R VNTR genotypes and 5-FU therapy was 
      found (p = .032). The 3R3R and 2R2R genotypes were significantly associated with 
      increased and decreased survival time, respectively (p = .003). The 3R3R genotype 
      was significantly associated with TYMS overexpression (p < .001). Moreover, a 
      significant association was found between the rs2612091 genotype and treatment 
      outcome (p = .017). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the impact of TYMS and 
      ENOSF1 genes as predictive indicators for survival and response to 5-FU-based 
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy in gastric cancer patients.

AB  - With investigators looking to expand engineered T cell therapies such as CAR-T to 
      new tumor targets and patient populations, a variety of cell manufacturing 
      platforms have been developed to scale manufacturing capacity using closed and/or 
      automated systems. Such platforms are particularly useful for solid tumor 
      targets, which typically require higher CAR-T cell doses. Although T cell 
      phenotype and function are key attributes that often correlate with therapeutic 
      efficacy, how manufacturing platforms influence the final CAR-T cell product is 
      currently unknown. We compared 4 commonly used T cell manufacturing platforms 
      (CliniMACS Prodigy, Xuri W25 rocking platform, G-Rex gas-permeable bioreactor, 
      static bag culture) using identical media, stimulation, culture length, and donor 
      starting material. Selected CD4(+)CD8(+) cells were transduced with lentiviral 
      vector incorporating a CAR targeting FGFR4, a promising target for pediatric 
      sarcoma. We observed significant differences in overall expansion over the 14-day 
      culture; bag cultures had the highest capacity for expansion while the Prodigy 
      had the lowest (481-fold versus 84-fold, respectively). Strikingly, we also 
      observed considerable differences in the phenotype of the final product, with the 
      Prodigy significantly enriched for CCR7(+)CD45RA(+) naive/stem central memory 
      (T(n/scm))-like cells at 46% compared to bag and G-Rex with 16% and 13%, 
      respectively. Gene expression analysis also showed that Prodigy CAR-Ts are more 
      naive, less cytotoxic and less exhausted than bag, G-Rex, and Xuri CAR-Ts, and 
      pointed to differences in cell metabolism that were confirmed via metabolic 
      assays. We hypothesized that dissolved oxygen level, which decreased 
      substantially during the final 3 days of the Prodigy culture, may contribute to 
      the observed differences in T cell phenotype. By culturing bag and G-Rex cultures 
      in 1% O(2) from day 5 onward, we could generate >60% T(n/scm)-like cells, with 
      longer time in hypoxia correlating with a higher percentage of T(n/scm)-like 
      cells. Intriguingly, our results suggest that oxygenation is responsible, at 
      least in part, for observed differences in T cell phenotype among bioreactors and 
      suggest hypoxic culture as a potential strategy prevent T cell differentiation 
      during expansion. Ultimately, our study demonstrates that selection of bioreactor 
      system may have profound effects not only on the capacity for expansion, but also 
      on the differentiation state of the resulting CAR-T cells.

      using a two-color DNA tetrahedron nanoprobe combined with molecular beacons.

AB  - A biosensor that can detect biomarkers accurately, quickly, and conveniently is 
      important for the diagnosis of various diseases. However, most of the existing 
      detection methods require sample extraction, which makes it difficult to detect 
      and image intracellular molecules or to detect two different types of biomarkers 
      simultaneously. In this study, we constructed a DNA tetrahedral nanoprobe (DTP) 
      capable of detecting both miR378 and telomerase, both of which are tumor markers. 
      In the presence of miR378, FAM on the molecular beacon of DTP fluoresced via 
      Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET), and the limit of detection was 476 pM 
      with excellent specificity. When present, telomerase binds to telomerase 
      substrate (TS) primers, extending the repeat sequence (TTAGGG)(n) to trigger Cy3 
      fluorescence. A strong linear relationship existed between the fluorescence 
      intensity of Cy3 and the number of HeLa cells. The limit of detection was 800 
      HeLa cells. In addition, DTP was less cytotoxic to and biocompatible with HeLa 
      cells and fluoresced only in cancer cells, which can help to sensitively 
      distinguish between normal and cancer cells. In conclusion, DTP can 
      simultaneously detect the content of miR378 and activity of telomerase and 
      realize intracellular imaging, which has broad application prospects in early 
      cancer diagnosis and treatment.

TI  - High Levels of Mutant Huntingtin Protein in Tear Fluid From Huntington's Disease 
      Gene Expansion Carriers.
PG  - 181-188
LID - 10.14802/jmd.24014 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant, fully penetrant, 
      neurodegenerative disease that most commonly affects middle-aged adults. HD is 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene, resulting in the expression of 
      mutant huntingtin (mHTT). Our aim was to detect and quantify mHTT in tear fluid, 
      which, to our knowledge, has never been measured before. METHODS: We recruited 20 
      manifest and 13 premanifest HD gene expansion carriers, and 20 age-matched 
      controls. All patients underwent detailed assessments, including the Unified 
      Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) total motor score (TMS) and total 
      functional capacity (TFC) score. Tear fluid was collected using paper Schirmer's 
      strips. The level of tear mHTT was determined using single-molecule counting 
      SMCxPRO technology. RESULTS: The average tear mHTT levels in manifest (67,223 +/- 
      80,360 fM) and premanifest patients (55,561 +/- 45,931 fM) were significantly 
      higher than those in controls (1,622 +/- 2,179 fM). We noted significant 
      correlations between tear mHTT levels and CAG repeat length, "estimated years to 
      diagnosis," disease burden score and UHDRS TMS and TFC. The receiver operating 
      curve demonstrated an almost perfect score (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.9975) 
      when comparing controls to manifest patients. Similarly, the AUC between controls 
      and premanifest patients was 0.9846. The optimal cutoff value for distinguishing 
      between controls and manifest patients was 4,544 fM, whereas it was 6,596 fM for 
      distinguishing between controls and premanifest patients. CONCLUSION: Tear mHTT 
      has potential for early and noninvasive detection of alterations in HD patients 
      and could be integrated into both clinical trials and clinical diagnostics.

TI  - The impact of folate pathway variants on the outcome of methotrexate therapy in 
      rheumatoid arthritis patients.
PG  - 971-983
LID - 10.1007/s10067-024-06892-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are currently no validated criteria that entirely explain or 
      predict response to methotrexate (MTX) treatment in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We 
      tried to identify the connection between three variants (RFC1 G80A (rs1051266), 
      TYMS 2R/3R (rs34743033), and ATIC C347G (rs2372536)) in the folate pathway of MTX 
      metabolism and the response to MTX monotherapy in a cohort of RA cases. METHODS: 
      A prospective study on 100 RA patients on MTX monotherapy was performed. Disease 
      activity was measured at the start of treatment and 6 months after treatment with 
      MTX. The patients were then split into two groups: those who responded to the 
      treatment and those who did not. The molecular genetic study for the RFC1 (G80A) 
      variant was employed via the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism 
      (PCR-RFLP) technique, the ATIC (C347G) variant was performed using TaqMan allelic 
      discrimination real-time PCR, and the tandem repeat sequences of TYMS (2R/3R) 
      were amplified by conventional PCR and detected by agarose gel electrophoresis. 
      RESULTS: The genotype distribution of RFC-1 (G80A) showed significant variations 
      among non-responders and responders in the recessive genetic model. A significant 
      difference was found in TYMS (2R/3R) in the dominant and heterozygous genetic 
      models. However, ATIC (C347G) genotype frequency did not exhibit substantial link 
      with drug response in all genetic models. Furthermore, the genotype and allele 
      rates of the analyzed variants did not show any significant association with 
      adverse events in all genetic models. CONCLUSION: The 80AA genotype of RFC-1 G80A 
      and the 2R/3R or 3R/3R genotypes of TYMS 2R/3R are more vulnerable to the good 
      consequences of MTX therapy. Key Points * Current recommendations support the 
      gold standard role of MTX as a first-line monotherapy for RA patients. However, 
      up to 40% of RA patients do not respond or exhibit partial response to MTX. * 
      Persistent disease activity due to treatment unresponsiveness will affect the 
      long-term outcomes in RA patients. * We aimed, through molecular genetic study, 
      to identify the connection between three variants in the folate pathway of MTX 
      metabolism and the response to methotrexate monotherapy in a cohort of RA 
      patients.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of laquinimod for Huntington's disease (LEGATO-HD): a 
      multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Laquinimod modulates CNS inflammatory pathways thought to be involved 
      in the pathology of Huntington's disease. Studies with laquinimod in transgenic 
      rodent models of Huntington's disease suggested improvements in motor function, 
      reduction of brain volume loss, and prolonged survival. We aimed to evaluate the 
      safety and efficacy of laquinimod in improving motor function and reducing 
      caudate volume loss in patients with Huntington's disease. METHODS: LEGATO-HD was 
      a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study done at 48 sites 
      across ten countries (Canada, Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, 
      Portugal, Russia, Spain, UK, and USA). Patients aged 21-55 years with a 
      cytosine-adenosine-guanine (CAG) repeat length of between 36 and 49 who had 
      symptomatic Huntington's disease with a Unified Huntington's Disease Rating 
      Scale-Total Motor Score (UHDRS-TMS) of higher than 5 and a Total Functional 
      Capacity score of 8 or higher were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) by centralised 
      interactive response technology to laquinimod 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, or 1.5 mg, or to 
      matching placebo, administered orally once daily over 52 weeks; people involved 
      in the randomisation had no other role in the study. Participants, investigators, 
      and study personnel were masked to treatment assignment. The 1.5 mg group was 
      discontinued before recruitment was finished because of cardiovascular safety 
      concerns in multiple sclerosis studies. The primary endpoint was change from 
      baseline in the UHDRS-TMS and the secondary endpoint was percent change in 
      caudate volume, both comparing the 1.0 mg group with the placebo group at week 
      52. Primary and secondary endpoints were assessed in the full analysis set (ie, 
      all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had at 
      least one post-baseline UHDRS-TMS assessment). Safety measures included adverse 
      event frequency and severity, and clinical and laboratory examinations, and were 
      assessed in the safety analysis set (ie, all randomised patients who received at 
      least one dose of study drug). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
      NCT02215616, and EudraCT, 2014-000418-75, and is now complete. FINDINGS: Between 
      Oct 28, 2014, and June 19, 2018, 352 adults with Huntington's disease (179 [51%] 
      men and 173 [49%] women; mean age 43.9 [SD 7.6] years and 340 [97%] White) were 
      randomly assigned: 107 to laquinimod 0.5 mg, 107 to laquinimod 1.0 mg, 30 to 
      laquinimod 1.5 mg, and 108 to matching placebo. Least squares mean change from 
      baseline in UHDRS-TMS at week 52 was 1.98 (SE 0.83) in the laquinimod 1.0 mg 
      group and 1.2 (0.82) in the placebo group (least squares mean difference 0.78 
      [95% CI -1.42 to 2.98], p=0.4853). Least squares mean change in caudate volume 
      was 3.10% (SE 0.38) in the 1.0 mg group and 4.86% (0.38) in the placebo group 
      (least squares mean difference -1.76% [95% CI -2.67 to -0.85]; p=0.0002). 
      Laquinimod was well tolerated and there were no new safety findings. Serious 
      adverse events were reported by eight (7%) patients on placebo, seven (7%) on 
      laquinimod 0.5 mg, five (5%) on laquinimod 1.0 mg, and one (3%) on laquinimod 1.5 
      mg. There was one death, which occurred in the placebo group and was unrelated to 
      treatment. The most frequent adverse events in all laquinimod dosed groups (0.5 
      mg, 1.0 mg, and 1.5 mg) were headache (38 [16%]), diarrhoea (24 [10%]), fall (18 
      [7%]), nasopharyngitis (20 [8%]), influenza (15 [6%]), vomiting (13 [5%]), 
      arthralgia (11 [5%]), irritability (ten [4%]), fatigue (eight [3%]), and insomnia 
      (eight [3%]). INTERPRETATION: Laquinimod did not show a significant effect on 
      motor symptoms assessed by the UHDRS-TMS, but significantly reduced caudate 
      volume loss compared with placebo at week 52. Huntington's disease has a chronic 
      and slowly progressive course, and this study does not address whether a longer 
      duration of laquinimod treatment could have produced detectable and meaningful 
      changes in the clinical assessments. FUNDING: Teva Pharmaceutical Industries.

AB  - Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-Ts) have remarkable efficacy in liquid 
      tumors, but limited responses in solid tumors. We conducted a Phase I trial 
      (NCT02107963) of GD2 CAR-Ts (GD2-CAR.OX40.28.z.iC9), demonstrating feasibility 
      and safety of administration in children and young adults with osteosarcoma and 
      neuroblastoma. Since CAR-T efficacy requires adequate CAR-T expansion, patients 
      were grouped into good or poor expanders across dose levels. Patient samples were 
      evaluated by multi-dimensional proteomic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic 
      analyses. T cell assessments identified naive T cells in pre-treatment apheresis 
      associated with good expansion, and exhausted T cells in CAR-T products with poor 
      expansion. Myeloid cell assessment identified CXCR3(+) monocytes in pre-treatment 
      apheresis associated with good expansion. Longitudinal analysis of post-treatment 
      samples identified increased CXCR3(-) classical monocytes in all groups as CAR-T 
      numbers waned. Together, our data uncover mediators of CAR-T biology and 
      correlates of expansion that could be utilized to advance immunotherapies for 
      solid tumor patients.

TI  - Short- and long-interval intracortical inhibition in EPM1 is related to genotype.
PG  - 208-217
LID - 10.1111/epi.17466 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Progressive myoclonic epilepsy type 1 (EPM1) is caused by biallelic 
      alterations in the CSTB gene, most commonly dodecamer repeat expansions. Although 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-induced long-interval intracortical 
      inhibition (LICI) was previously reported to be normal in EPM1, short-interval 
      intracortical inhibition (SICI) was reduced. We explored the association between 
      these measures and the clinical and genetic features in a separate group of 
      patients with EPM1. METHODS: TMS combined with electromyography was performed 
      under neuronavigation. LICI was induced with an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of 
      100 ms, and SICI with ISIs of 2 and 3 ms, and their means (mSICIs) were expressed 
      as the ratio of conditioned to unconditioned stimuli. LICI and mSICI were 
      compared between patients and controls. Nonparametric correlation was used to 
      study the association between inhibition and parameters of clinical severity, 
      including the Unified Myoclonus Rating Scale (UMRS); among patients with EPM1 due 
      to biallelic expansion repeats, also the association with the number of repeats 
      was assessed. RESULTS: The study protocol was completed in 19 patients (15 with 
      biallelic expansion repeats and 4 compound heterozygotes), and 7 healthy, age- 
      and sex-matched control participants. Compared to controls, patients demonstrated 
      significantly less SICI (median mSICI ratio 1.18 vs 0.38; p < .001). Neither LICI 
      nor SICI was associated with parameters of clinical severity. In participants 
      with biallelic repeat expansions, the number of repeats in the more affected 
      allele (greater repeat number [GRN]) correlated with LICI (rho = 0.872; p < .001) 
      and SICI (rho = 0.689; p = .006). SIGNIFICANCE: Our results strengthen the 
      finding of deranged gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic inhibition in EPM1. LICI and 
      SICI may have use as markers of GABAergic impairment in future trials of 
      disease-modifying treatment in this condition. Whether a higher number of 
      expansion repeats leads to greater GABAergic impairment warrants further study.

TI  - Moyamoya associated with Turner syndrome in a patient with type 2 spinocerebellar 
      ataxia-Occam's razor or Hickam's dictum: a case report.
PG  - 381
LID - 10.1186/s12883-022-02912-x [doi]
LID - 381
AB  - BACKGROUND: Turner syndrome (TS) is a rare condition associated with a completely 
      or partially missing X chromosome that affects 1 in 2500 girls. TS increases the 
      risk of autoimmune diseases, including Graves' disease (GD). Moyamoya disease is 
      a rare cerebral arteriopathy of unknown etiology characterized by progressive 
      bilateral stenosis of the internal carotid artery and its branches. Both TS and 
      GD have been associated with Moyamoya. Type 2 spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA2) is an 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia caused by a CAG repeat expansion in ATXN2. 
      We present the first case of Moyamoya syndrome in a patient with a previous 
      diagnosis of TS and GD who tested positive for SCA2 and had imaging findings 
      compatible with an overlap of SCA2 and Moyamoya. CASE PRESENTATION: A 43-year-old 
      woman presented with mild gait imbalance for 2 years. Her family history was 
      positive for type 2 spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA2). She had been diagnosed with 
      Turner Syndrome (45,X) and Graves disease three years before. Brain MRI revealed 
      bilateral frontal and parietal cystic encephalomalacia in watershed zones, 
      atrophy of pons, middle cerebellar peduncles and cerebellum. MR angiography 
      showed progressive stenosis of both internal carotid arteries with 
      lenticulostriate collaterals, suggestive of Moya-Moya disease. Molecular analysis 
      confirmed the diagnosis of SCA2. CONCLUSIONS: With increased availability of 
      tools for genetic diagnosis, physicians need to be aware of the possibility of a 
      single patient presenting two or more rare diseases. This report underscores the 
      modern dilemmas created by increasingly accurate imaging techniques and available 
      and extensive genetic testing.

TI  - DNA Sequence Specificity Reveals a Role of the HLTF HIRAN Domain in the 
      Recognition of Trinucleotide Repeats.
LID - 10.1021/acs.biochem.2c00027 [doi]
AB  - DNA damage tolerance (DDT) pathways enable cells to cope with a variety of 
      replication blocks that threaten their ability to complete DNA replication. 
      Helicase-like transcription factor (HLTF) plays a central role in the error-free 
      DDT pathway, template switching (TS), by serving as a ubiquitin ligase to 
      polyubiquitinate the DNA sliding clamp PCNA, which promotes TS initiation. HLTF 
      also serves as an ATP-dependent DNA translocase facilitating replication fork 
      remodeling. The HIP116, Rad5p N-terminal (HIRAN) domain of HLTF specifically 
      recognizes the unmodified 3'-end of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) at stalled 
      replication forks to promote fork regression. Several crystal structures of the 
      HIRAN domain in complex with ssDNA have been reported; however, optimal ssDNA 
      sequences for high-affinity binding with the domain have not been described. Here 
      we elucidated DNA sequence preferences of HLTF HIRAN through systematic studies 
      of its binding to ssDNA substrates using fluorescence polarization assays and a 
      computational analysis of the ssDNA:HIRAN interaction. These studies reveal that 
      the HLTF HIRAN domain preferentially recognizes a (T/C)TG sequence at the 
      3'-hydroxyl ssDNA end, which occurs in the CTG trinucleotide repeat (TNR) regions 
      that are susceptible to expansion and deletion mutations identified in 
      neuromuscular and neurodegenerative disorders. These findings support a role for 
      HLTF in maintaining the stability of difficult to replicate TNR microsatellite 
      regions.

TI  - Abnormal sensorimotor cortex and thalamo-cortical networks in familial adult 
      myoclonic epilepsy type 2: pathophysiology and diagnostic implications.
PG  - fcac037

LID - fcac037
AB  - Familial adult myoclonic epilepsy type 2 is a hereditary condition characterized 
      by cortical tremor, myoclonus and epilepsy. It belongs to the spectrum of 
      cortical myoclonus and the sensorimotor cortex hyperexcitability represents an 
      important pathogenic mechanism underlying this condition. Besides pericentral 
      cortical structures, the impairment of subcortical networks seems also to play a 
      pathogenetic role, mainly via the thalamo-cortical pathway. However, the 
      mechanisms underlying cortical-subcortical circuits dysfunction, as well as their 
      impact on clinical manifestations, are still unknown. Therefore, the main aims of 
      our study were to systematically study with an extensive electrophysiological 
      battery, the cortical sensorimotor, as well as thalamo-cortical networks in 
      genetically confirmed familial adult myoclonic epilepsy patients and to establish 
      reliable neurophysiological biomarkers for the diagnosis. In 26 familial 
      myoclonic epilepsy subjects, harbouring the intronic ATTTC repeat expansion in 
      the StAR-related lipid transfer domain-containing 7 gene, 17 juvenile myoclonic 
      epilepsy patients and 22 healthy controls, we evaluated the facilitatory and 
      inhibitory circuits within the primary motor cortex using single and paired-pulse 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation paradigms. We also probed the excitability of 
      the somatosensory, as well as the thalamo-somatosensory cortex connection by 
      using ad hoc somatosensory evoked potential protocols. The sensitivity and 
      specificity of transcranial magnetic stimulation and somatosensory evoked 
      potential metrics were derived from receiver operating curve analysis. Familial 
      adult myoclonic epilepsy patients displayed increased facilitation and decreased 
      inhibition within the sensorimotor cortex compared with juvenile myoclonic 
      epilepsy patients (all P < 0.05) and healthy controls (all P < 0.05). 
      Somatosensory evoked potential protocols also displayed a significant reduction 
      of early high-frequency oscillations and less inhibition at paired-pulse 
      protocol, suggesting a concomitant failure of thalamo-somatosensory cortex 
      circuits. Disease onset and duration and myoclonus severity did not correlate 
      either with sensorimotor hyperexcitability or thalamo-cortical measures (all 
      P > 0.05). Patients with a longer disease duration had more severe myoclonus 
      (r = 0.467, P = 0.02) associated with a lower frequency (r = -0.607, P = 0.001) 
      and higher power of tremor (r = 0.479, P = 0.02). Finally, familial adult 
      myoclonic epilepsy was reliably diagnosed using transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation, demonstrating its superiority as a diagnostic factor compared to 
      somatosensory evoked potential measures. In conclusion, deficits of sensorimotor 
      cortical and thalamo-cortical circuits are involved in the pathophysiology of 
      familial adult myoclonic epilepsy even if these alterations are not associated 
      with clinical severity. Transcranial magnetic stimulation-based measurements 
      display an overall higher accuracy than somatosensory evoked potential parameters 
      to reliably distinguish familial adult myoclonic epilepsy from juvenile myoclonic 
      epilepsy and healthy controls.

TI  - "Spazio Huntington": Tracing the Early Motor, Cognitive and Behavioral Profiles

AB  - The "Spazio Huntington-A Place for Children" program was launched in 2019. The 
      aim was to contact at risk kids within Huntington disease (HD) families, to 
      provide counseling to their parents and to start a prospective follow-up of kids 
      suspicious to manifest pediatric HD (PHD). We met 25 at risk kids in two years, 
      four of whom with PHD and highly expanded (HE) mutations beyond 80 CAG repeats. 
      We rated motor, neuropsychological and behavioral changes in all PHD kids by the 
      Unified HD Rating Scale (UHDRS)-total motor score (TMS) and additional measures 
      of (1) cognitive level (Leiter International Performance Scale), (2) adaptive 
      functioning (Adaptive Behavior Assessment Systems), (3) receptive language 
      (Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test) and (4) behavioral abnormalities (Child 
      Behavior Check List and Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale). All 
      PHD kids showed a severe progression of neurological and psychiatric 
      manifestations including motor, cognitive and behavioral changes. The magnetic 
      resonance imaging contributed to confirm the suspicious clinical observation by 
      highlighting very initial striatum abnormalities in PHD. Spazio Huntington is a 
      program to prospectively study PHD, the most atypical face of HD, and may 
      represent the basis to recruit PHD patients in future clinical trials.

AB  - The aim of the current study was to investigate the prognostic and predictive 
      significance of polymorphisms in the thymidylate synthase (TS) gene, alongside 
      the loss of heterozygocity (LOH) at this gene locus in patients with colorectal 
      cancer. Genotyping was carried out for a variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) 
      polymorphism in the TS 5'-untranslated region, a G/C single nucleotide 
      polymorphism (SNP) located within this VNTR, and for TS LOH status in 246 
      colorectal cancer and paired normal DNA samples. The results were analyzed in 
      relation to clinicopathological features, including the prognostic and predictive 
      significance of TS genotype in patients who underwent curative surgery. Complete 
      VNTR, SNP and LOH information for TS was obtained in 226 cases. No significant 
      associations were observed between normal tissue TS genotype status and 
      clinicopathological features. LOH of TS was observed in 58% of tumor samples and 
      was associated with poor prognosis independently of clinical stage. Cases 
      exhibiting TS LOH were classified into the three groups of 2R/loss, 3G/loss and 
      3C/loss. Patients with 3C/loss genotype status had poor outcomes when treated by 
      surgery alone, but their survival was similar to patients with other genotypes 
      following Fluorouracil (5-FU)-based adjuvant chemotherapy. The results suggested 
      that LOH of the TS locus may be a significant prognostic factor in colorectal 
      cancer, with the genotype of the residual allele also demonstrating an influence 
      on prognosis. In conclusion, LOH status should be considered when TS genotype is 
      explored as a potential prognostic and predictive marker for 5-FU-based adjuvant 
      chemotherapy in colorectal cancer.

TI  - Elevated common variant genetic risk for tourette syndrome in a densely-affected 
      pedigree.

AB  - Tourette syndrome (TS) is a highly heritable neuropsychiatric disorder with 
      complex patterns of genetic inheritance. Recent genetic findings in TS have 
      highlighted both numerous common variants with small effects and a few rare 
      variants with moderate or large effects. Here we searched for genetic causes of 
      TS in a large, densely-affected British pedigree using a systematic genomic 
      approach. This pedigree spans six generations and includes 122 members, 85 of 
      whom were individually interviewed, and 53 of whom were diagnosed as "cases" 
      (consisting of 28 with definite or probable TS, 20 with chronic multiple tics 
      [CMT], and five with obsessive-compulsive behaviors [OCB]). A total of 66 DNA 
      samples were available (25 TS, 15 CMT, 4 OCB cases, and 22 unaffecteds) and all 
      were genotyped using a dense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array to 
      identify shared segments, copy number variants (CNVs), and to calculate genetic 
      risk scores. Eight cases were also whole genome sequenced to test whether any 
      rare variants were shared identical by descent. While we did not identify any 
      notable CNVs, single nucleotide variants, indels or repeat expansions of 
      near-Mendelian effect, the most distinctive feature of this family proved to be 
      an unusually high load of common risk alleles for TS. We found that cases within 
      this family carried a higher load of TS common variant risk similar to that 
      previously found in unrelated TS cases. Thus far, the strongest evidence from 
      genetic data for contribution to TS risk in this family comes from multiple 
      common risk variants rather than one or a few variants of strong effect.

TI  - Strand-specific effect of Rad26 and TFIIS in rescuing transcriptional arrest by 
      CAG trinucleotide repeat slip-outs.
PG  - 7618-7627
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkab573 [doi]
AB  - Transcription induced CAG repeat instability is associated with fatal 
      neurological disorders. Genetic approaches found transcription-coupled nucleotide 
      excision repair (TC-NER) factor CSB protein and TFIIS play critical roles in 
      modulating the repeat stability. Here, we took advantage of an in vitro 
      reconstituted yeast transcription system to investigate the underlying mechanism 
      of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcriptional pausing/stalling by CAG slip-out 
      structures and the functions of TFIIS and Rad26, the yeast ortholog of CSB, in 
      modulating transcriptional arrest. We identified length-dependent and 
      strand-specific mechanisms that account for CAG slip-out induced transcriptional 
      arrest. We found substantial R-loop formation for the distal transcriptional 
      pausing induced by template strand (TS) slip-out, but not non-template strand 
      (NTS) slip-out. In contrast, Pol II backtracking was observed at the proximal 
      transcriptional pausing sites induced by both NTS and TS slip-out blockage. 
      Strikingly, we revealed that Rad26 and TFIIS can stimulate bypass of NTS CAG 
      slip-out, but not TS slip-out induced distal pausing. Our biochemical results 
      provide new insights into understanding the mechanism of CAG slip-out induced 
      transcriptional pausing and functions of transcription factors in modulating 
      transcription-coupled CAG repeat instability, which may pave the way for 
      developing potential strategies for the treatment of repeat sequence associated 
      human diseases.

TI  - Pharmacogenetic study in gastric cancer patients treated with adjuvant 
      fluorouracil/leucovorin or epirubicin/cisplatin/fluorouracil before and after 
      chemoradiation on CALGB 80101 (Alliance).
PG  - 215-220
LID - 10.1097/FPC.0000000000000442 [doi]
AB  - There is a lack of pharmacogenetic predictors of outcome in gastric cancer 
      patients. The aim of this study was to assess previously identified candidate 
      genes associated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), cisplatin, or epirubicin toxicity or 
      response in a cohort of resected gastric cancer patients treated on CALGB 
      (Alliance) 80101. Gastric or gastroesophageal cancer patients randomized to 
      adjuvant 5-FU/leucovorin or epirubicin/cisplatin/5-FU before and after 5-FU 
      chemoradiation were genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in GSTP1 
      (rs1695), ERCC1 (rs11615 and rs3212986), XRCC1 (rs25487), UGT2B7 (rs7439366) and 
      the 28 base-pair tandem repeats in TYMS (rs34743033). Logistic regression and log 
      rank tests were used to assess the association between each SNP and incidence of 
      grade 3/4 neutropenia and leukopenia, overall (OS) and progression-free survival 
      (PFS), respectively. Toxicity endpoint analyses were adjusted for the treatment 
      arm, while OS and PFS were also adjusted for performance status, sex, age, lymph 
      node involvement, and primary tumor site and size. Of 281 subjects with 
      successful genotyping results and available clinical (toxicity and efficacy) 
      data, 166 self-reported non-Hispanic White patients were included in the final 
      analysis. There was a lack of evidence of an association among any SNPs tested 
      with grade 3/4 neutropenia and leukopenia or OS and PFS. Age, lymph node 
      involvement, and primary tumor size were significantly associated with OS and 
      PFS. This study failed to confirm results of previous gastric cancer 
      pharmacogenetic studies.

TI  - Longitudinal Evaluation of the Effect of Tricyclic Antidepressants and 
      Neuroleptics on the Course of Huntington's Disease-Data from a Real World Cohort.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci11040413 [doi]

AB  - Background: Reducing the progress of neurodegeneration is a key goal in 
      Huntington s disease (HD). A previously performed systematic screening for 
      medications with neuroprotective features identified tricyclic antidepressants 
      and neuroleptics as neuroprotective and mitochondrioprotective agents. Here, we 
      analyzed the characteristics of disease manifestation, progression and potential 
      beneficial effects in HD patients treated with afore-mentioned medications 
      compared to un- and otherwise treated motor-manifest patients in a large 
      real-world cohort over two years. Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional data of 
      the largest cohort worldwide of motor-manifest HD patients using the ENROLL-HD 
      database, including demographic, moleculargenetic, clinical-motoric, cognitive 
      and functional data. Longitudinal data of up to two years were obtained to 
      analyze potential effects on disease progression between groups with different 
      medications used. Data were analyzed using repeated ANOVA-analyses while 
      controlling for the co-variates age and CAG-repeat length. Results: We identified 
      n = 7397 motor-manifest HD patients using no or different medication (HD-ctrl) 
      and subgroups treated with clomipramine (n = 56), clozapine (n = 66), 
      chlorpromazine (n = 17), doxepine (n = 34) and desi-, imi- or trimipramine (n = 
      19). Demographic parameters, disease onset and CAP-score did not differ. Total 
      motor scores (TMS) at baseline were higher in patients treated with clozapine (p 
      < 0.001), chlorpromazine and clomipramine (p < 0.05) compared to HD-ctrl with 
      higher sub scores for bradykinesia (all p < 0.01) and dystonia in clozapine 
      treated patients (p < 0.001). Functional and cognitive capacities were worse in 
      medication groups in comparison to HD-ctrl at baseline (p < 0.001). Repeated 
      measures analysis of variance documented no differences regarding motoric, 
      functional and cognitive disease progressions between groups. Conclusions: We 
      identified group differences, potentially caused by side effects or potential 
      selection bias in terms of bradykinetic motoric symptoms, more dystonia and lower 
      functional and cognitive performance in some treatment groups at baseline, which 
      were not entirely explained because of underlying fundamental characteristics. 
      Disease progression regarding clinical, functional and cognitive outcomes over 
      two years was not affected by any of the treatment groups compared to HD-ctrl. 
      Our data do not support our hypothesis of a potential neuroprotective effect of 
      these drugs on disease progression.

TI  - A Novel Nomenclature for Repeat Motifs in the Thymidylate Synthase Enhancer 
      Region and Its Relevance for Pharmacogenetic Studies.

LID - 181
AB  - Inhibition of thymidylate synthase (TS) is the primary mode of action for 
      5-fluorouracil (5FU) chemotherapy. TS expression is modulated by a variable 
      number of tandem repeats in the TS enhancer region (TSER) located upstream of the 
      TS gene (TYMS). Variability in the TSER has been suggested to contribute to 
      5FU-induced adverse events. However, the precise genetic associations remain 
      largely undefined due to high polymorphism and ambiguity in defining genotypes. 
      To assess toxicity associations, we sequenced the TSER in 629 cancer patients 
      treated with 5FU. Of the 13 alleles identified, few could be unambiguously named 
      using current TSER-nomenclature. We devised a concise and unambiguous systematic 
      naming approach for TSER-alleles that encompasses all known variants. After 
      applying this comprehensive naming system to our data, we demonstrated that the 
      number of upstream stimulatory factor (USF1-)binding sites in the TSER was 
      significantly associated with gastrointestinal toxicity in 5FU treatment.

TI  - Impact of parental origin of X-chromosome on clinical and biochemical profile in 
      Turner syndrome.
PG  - 1155-1163

AB  - Objectives To evaluate if the parental origin of X-chromosome has an impact on 
      the phenotype and biochemical profile in Turner syndrome (TS). Result of the 
      previous studies have been equivocal and could be attributable to the 
      multicentric study design with different experts examining heterogeneous TS 
      population of various ethnic background. Methods A cross-sectional single center 
      study from Northern India. Fifty nine diagnosed subjects of TS and their parents 
      participated in the study. Parental origin of intact X-chromosome was determined 
      using 12 highly polymorphic short tandem repeats (STR) on X-chromosome. For the 
      evaluation of parent-of-origin effects, typical phenotypic traits including 
      congenital malformations, anthropometry, body composition by dual energy X-ray 
      absorptiometry (DXA) and biochemical profile were compared. Clinical stigmata of 
      TS in all subjects were examined by a single expert. Results The intact 
      X-chromosome was of maternal origin (Xm) in 49.1% subjects while 50.9% had 
      paternal origin (Xp). Skeletal anomalies were more common in Xm group, out of 
      which prevalence of short neck and short fourth metatarsal reached statistical 
      significance (p=0.04 and 0.01 respectively). A strong correlation was observed 
      between subject's baseline height standard deviation score (Ht SDS) and paternal 
      height (r=0.593, p<0.001), maternal height (r=0.564, p<0.001) and mid-parental 
      height (MPH) (r=0.372, p=0.047) in Xp group. This effect was not seen in Xm 
      subjects whose baseline Ht SDS showed no significant correlation with maternal 
      height, paternal height or MPH. No differences were detected between the groups 
      with regard to biochemical profile or body composition. Conclusions We speculate 
      that the differences in skeletal anomalies and height correlations between Xm and 
      Xp groups could be due to the modifying effect of epigenetic signature on short 
      stature homeobox (SHOX) gene of Xm. SHOX gene is not modified on Xp thereby 
      explaining the paucity of skeletal changes and height correlations in Xp 
      subjects.

TI  - The Role of Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase and Thymidylate Synthase 
      Polymorphisms in Fluoropyrimidine-Based Cancer Chemotherapy in an Iranian 
      Population.
PG  - 157-164
AB  - BACKGROUND: The fluoropyrimidine drug 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and the prodrug 
      capecitabine have been extensively used for treatment of many types of cancer 
      including colorectal, gastric, head and neck. Approximately, 10 to 25% of 
      patients suffer from severe fluoropyrimidine-induced toxicity. This may lead to 
      dose reduction and treatment discontinuation. Pharmacogenetics research could be 
      useful for the identification of predictive markers in chemotherapy treatment. 
      The aim of the study was to investigate the role of five genetic polymorphisms 
      within two genes (DPYD, TYMS) in toxicity and efficacy of fluoropyrimidine-based 
      chemotherapy. METHODS: Total genomic DNA was extracted from 83 cancer patients 
      treated with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. In this study, three 
      polymorphisms were genotyped in dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase gene c.1905+1 G>A 
      (DPYD*2A; rs3918290), c.1679 T>G (I560S; DPYD*13; rs55886062), and c.2846A>T 
      (D949V; rs67376798) and two polymorphisms, besides the Variable Number of Tandem 
      Repeat (VNTR) polymorphism and 6-bp insertion/deletion polymorphism in 
      thymidylate synthase gene. The analysis of polymorphisms for rs3918290, 
      rs55886062, rs67376798 and 6-bp insertion/deletion in TYMS was done by Polymerase 
      Chain Reaction-restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCRRFLP) TYMS VNTR 
      analysis. 5-FU-related toxicities such as anemia, febrile neutropenia, 
      neurotoxicity, vomiting, nausea, and mucositis were evaluated according to 
      NCI-CTC criteria version 4.0. T-test and chi-square were used and p-values less 
      than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: DPYD gene 
      polymorphisms were not observed in this study. The frequency of the TYMS +6 bp 
      allele was 40.35% and the -6 bp allele was 59.65% in this study. The frequency of 
      VNTR 2R allele was 48.75% and 3R allele was 51.15%. Toxicity grade II diarrhea, 
      mucositis, nausea, vomiting, and neurotoxicity was 2.2, 24.1, 15.7, 6, and 51.8%, 
      respectively. Thymidylate synthase ins/del polymorphisms were associated with 
      increased grade III neurotoxicity (p=0.02). Furthermore, anemia grade III was 
      significantly associated with 2R/2R genotype (0.009). CONCLUSION: Thymidylate 
      synthase gene polymorphisms may play a key role in fluoropyrimidne -based 
      chemotherapy. Although rare DPYD polymorphisms were not observed in our study, 
      according to large population studies, DPYD gene polymorphisms could be used as a 
      predictive biomarker for patient treatments.

AB  - Introduction: High dose methotrexate (HD-Mtx) is highly effective and 
      significantly improves overall acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients 
      survival. The pharmacodynamics of Mtx depends on the polymorphism of genes 
      encoding proteins engaged in the folate metabolism pathway. The aim of the 
      current study is to determine the relationship between variants of folate 
      metabolism-related genes and the frequency of acute toxicities of HD-Mtx. 
      Material and Methods: A group of 133 patients aged 1.5-18.1 years (median: 6.3) 
      was treated in accordance with the ALL-IC-2002 and ALL-IC-2009 protocols. The 
      following polymorphisms were determined: 80 G>A SLC19A1 (solute carrier family 19 
      member 1; rs1051266) with direct DNA sequencing, as well as 677 C>T MTHFR 
      (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase; rs1801133) and the tandem repeats of the TS 
      (thymidylate synthase) with PCR technique. HD-Mtx organ toxicities were evaluated 
      based on the laboratory tests results and the National Cancer Institute criteria. 
      Results: In patients with genotypes AA for SLC19A1 and CC or CT for MTHFR Mtx 
      steady state concentrations (C(ss)) and AUC(inf) were distinctly higher. In 
      patients with genotype 3R/3R for TS initial elimination rate constant was 
      significantly higher (P = 0.003). Patients receiving Mtx at the dose of 5 g/m(2) 
      had lower clearance (4.35 vs. 8.92 L/h/m(2)) as compared to the ones receiving 2 
      g/m(2) that indicates non-linear Mtx elimination at the higher dose. Liver 
      impairment was the most frequently observed toxicity. The homozygous genotype was 
      associated with a significantly higher incidence of hepatic toxicity for both the 
      SLC19A1 (P = 0.037) and TS (P = 0.002). Logistic regression analysis indicated an 
      increased risk of vomiting for the 2R/3R genotype of the TS gene (OR 3.20, 95% CI 
      1.33-7.68, P = 0.009) and for vomiting and hepatic toxicity for the 3R/3R 
      genotype (vomiting: OR 3.39, 95% CI 1.12-10.23, P = 0.031; liver toxicity: OR 
      2.28, 95% CI 1.05-4.95, P = 0.038). None of the acute toxicities differed between 
      the analyzed dosing groups. Conclusions: Determination of polymorphisms of 
      SLC19A1, MTHFR, and TS genes might allow for a better prior selection of patients 
      with higher risk of elevated Mtx levels. Our study is the first one to report the 
      increased risk of hepatotoxicity and vomiting in patients with TS polymorphisms.

TI  - A New Risk Variant for Multiple Sclerosis at 11q23.3 Locus Is Associated with 
      Expansion of CXCR5+ Circulating Regulatory T Cells.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies and meta-analysis have contributed to the 
      identification of more than 200 loci associated with multiple sclerosis (MS). 
      However, a proportion of MS heritability remains unknown. We aimed to uncover new 
      genetic variants associated with MS and determine their functional effects. For 
      this, we resequenced the exons and regulatory sequences of 14 MS risk genes in a 
      cohort of MS patients and healthy individuals (n = 1,070) and attempted to 
      validate a selection of signals through genotyping in an independent cohort (n = 
      5,138). We identified three new MS-associated variants at C-X-C motif chemokine 
      receptor 5 (CXCR5), Ts translation elongation factor, mitochondrial (TSFM) and 
      cytochrome P450 family 24 subfamily A member 1 (CYP24A1). Rs10892307 resulted in 
      a new signal at the CXCR5 region that explains one of the associations with MS 
      within the locus. This polymorphism and three others in high linkage 
      disequilibrium mapped within regulatory regions. Of them, rs11602393 showed 
      allele-dependent enhancer activity in the forward orientation as determined by 
      luciferase reporter assays. Immunophenotyping using peripheral blood mononuclear 
      cells from MS patients associated the minor allele of rs10892307 with increased 
      percentage of regulatory T cells expressing CXCR5. This work reports a new signal 
      for the CXCR5 MS risk locus and points to rs11602393 as the causal variant. The 
      expansion of CXCR5+ circulating regulatory T cells induced by this variant could 
      cause its MS association.

TI  - Plasma Homocysteine and Polymorphisms of Genes Involved in Folate Metabolism 
      Correlate with DNMT1 Gene Methylation Levels.
LID - 10.3390/metabo9120298 [doi]
LID - 298
AB  - DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) is responsible for the maintenance of DNA 
      methylation patterns during cell division. Several human diseases are 
      characterized by impaired DNMT1 gene methylation, but less is known about the 
      factors that regulate DNMT1 promoter methylation levels. Dietary folates and 
      related B-vitamins are essential micronutrients for DNA methylation processes, 
      and we performed the present study to investigate the contribution of circulating 
      folate, vitamin B12, homocysteine, and common polymorphisms in folate pathway 
      genes to the DNMT1 gene methylation levels. We investigated DNMT1 gene 
      methylation levels in peripheral blood DNA samples from 215 healthy individuals. 
      All the DNA samples were genotyped for MTHFR 677C > T (rs1801133) and 1298A > C 
      (rs1801131), MTRR 66A > G (rs1801394), MTR 2756A > G (rs1805087), SLC19A1 (RFC1) 
      80G > A (rs1051266), TYMS 28-bp tandem repeats (rs34743033) and 1494 6-bp 
      insertion/deletion (indel) (rs34489327), DNMT3A -448A > G (rs1550117), and DNMT3B 
      -149C > T (rs2424913) polymorphisms. Circulating homocysteine, folate, and 
      vitamin B12 levels were available from 158 of the recruited individuals. We 
      observed an inverse correlation between plasma homocysteine and DNMT1 methylation 
      levels. Furthermore, both MTR rs1805087 and TYMS rs34743033 polymorphisms showed 
      a statistically significant effect on DNMT1 methylation levels. The present study 
      revealed several correlations between the folate metabolic pathway and DNMT1 
      promoter methylation that could be of relevance for those disorders characterized 
      by altered DNA methylation.

TI  - Association of Polymorphisms in Genes Involved in One-Carbon Metabolism with 
      MTHFR Methylation Levels.
LID - 10.3390/ijms20153754 [doi]
LID - 3754
AB  - Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is a pivotal enzyme in the one-carbon 
      metabolism, a metabolic pathway required for DNA synthesis and methylation 
      reactions. MTHFR hypermethylation, resulting in reduced gene expression, can 
      contribute to several human disorders, but little is still known about the 
      factors that regulate MTHFR methylation levels. We performed the present study to 
      investigate if common polymorphisms in one-carbon metabolism genes contribute to 
      MTHFR methylation levels. MTHFR methylation was assessed in peripheral blood DNA 
      samples from 206 healthy subjects with methylation-sensitive high-resolution 
      melting (MS-HRM); genotyping was performed for MTHFR 677C>T (rs1801133) and 
      1298A>C (rs1801131), MTRR 66A>G (rs1801394), MTR 2756A>G (rs1805087), SLC19A1 
      (RFC1) 80G>A (rs1051266), TYMS 28-bp tandem repeats (rs34743033) and 1494 6-bp 
      ins/del (rs34489327), DNMT3A -448A>G (rs1550117), and DNMT3B -149C>T (rs2424913) 
      polymorphisms. We observed a statistically significant effect of the DNMT3B 
      -149C>T polymorphism on mean MTHFR methylation levels, and particularly CT and TT 
      carriers showed increased methylation levels than CC carriers. The present study 
      revealed an association between a functional polymorphism of DNMT3B and MTHFR 
      methylation levels that could be of relevance in those disorders, such as inborn 
      defects, metabolic disorders and cancer, that have been linked to impaired DNA 
      methylation.

TI  - Effect of alcohol use disorder on cellular aging.
PG  - 3245-3255
LID - 10.1007/s00213-019-05281-5 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Human telomeres consist of tandem repeats at chromosome ends which 
      protect chromosomal DNA from degradation. Telomere shortening occurs as part of 
      natural aging; however, life stressors, smoking, drug use, BMI, and psychiatric 
      disorders could disrupt cell aging and affect telomere length (TL). In this 
      context, studies have evaluated the effects of alcohol consumption on TL; 
      however, results have been inconsistent, which may reflect diverse drinking 
      cut-offs and categorizations. OBJECTIVES: To help clarify this, the present study 
      addresses the association of TL with alcohol use disorder (AUD), drinking 
      behaviors, lifetime stress, and chronological age. METHODS: TL was quantified as 
      the telomere to albumin ratio (T/S ratio) obtained from peripheral blood DNA 
      using the quantitative PCR assay, from 260 participants with AUD and 449 
      non-dependent healthy controls (HC) from an existing National Institute on 
      Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) database. RESULTS: AUD participants showed 
      shorter TL compared to HC with both, age, and AUD, as independent predictors as 
      well as a significant AUD with age interaction effect on TL. TL was also 
      associated with impulsiveness in AUD participants. We did not observe an 
      association between TL and chronicity of alcohol use, alcohol doses ingested, or 
      childhood trauma exposures in either AUD or HC, although very few HC reported a 
      history of childhood trauma. CONCLUSION: Our results support previous findings of 
      telomere shortening with chronic alcohol exposures and show both an effect of AUD 
      on TL that is independent of age as well as a significant AUD by age interaction 
      on TL. These findings are consistent with accelerated cellular aging in AUD.

TI  - Comparing Risperidone and Olanzapine to Tetrabenazine for the Management of 
      Chorea in Huntington Disease: An Analysis from the Enroll-HD Database.
PG  - 132-138
LID - 10.1002/mdc3.12706 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Huntington's chorea (HC) is commonly managed with neuroleptic 
      medications, though there is little evidence to support their use. This study 
      aimed to perform a real-world comparison of the efficacy of risperidone and 
      olanzapine to tetrabenazine (TBZ) for HC. METHODS: The Enroll-HD database was 
      used to perform a propensity score-matched comparison of risperidone and 
      olanzapine to TBZ, regarding their efficacy in controlling chorea. Participants 
      with motor manifest Huntington's disease (HD) were grouped according to their use 
      of risperidone, olanzapine, or TBZ. For the three groups, independent propensity 
      score matching was performed on participants' baseline total functional score 
      (TFC), baseline total motor score (TMS), disease burden score, CAG repeat length, 
      baseline age, region, sex, and body mass index. Independent samples t test was 
      used to calculate the differences between the groups in the annual rate of change 
      of the TMS from the baseline to the second available visit. RESULTS: The 
      risperidone (n = 72) and olanzapine groups (n = 77) had annualized increases 
      (worsening) in the TMS of only 1.47 points and 3.20 points, respectively, 
      compared to 5.70 points in the two matched TBZ groups (n = 72) (P = 0.019) and 
      (n = 77) (P = 0.143), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of prospective 
      data, this analysis of the Enroll-HD database found that the neuroleptics 
      risperidone and olanzapine seemed to at least be comparable to TBZ at controlling 
      HC. These results demonstrate that neuroleptics may have comparable efficacy to 
      TBZ for the treatment of HC. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm 
      these findings.

TI  - Thymidylate synthase gene polymorphism predicts disease free survival in stage 
      II-III rectal adenocarcinoma patients receiving adjuvant 5-FU-based chemotherapy.
PG  - 28

AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective is to investigate whether thymidylate synthase gene TS 
      5'-UTR polymorphism of peripheral blood mononuclear cells are associated with 
      clinical outcomes of patients with stage II-III rectal adenocarcinoma treated 
      with adjuvant 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) chemotherapy in Chinese population. METHODS: 
      One hundred and seventeen pathologically diagnosed colorectal adenocarcinoma 
      patients with stage II-III, who underwent curative resection and received 
      5-fluoropyrimidine-based adjuvant chemotherapy were enrolled to this study. The 
      5'-TSER polymorphisms determined from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells were 
      measured by Direct Sequencing. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests were used 
      for survival analysis. The independent prognostic factors influencing DFS and OS 
      were estimated by Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: The distribution of TS 
      5'-UTR polymorphisms ware 2.6% 2R/2R, 31.6% 2R/3R and 65.8% 3R/3R respectively, 
      which was fitted with Hard-Weinberg equilibrium (chi2=0.345, P=0.558). Stage, N 
      stage, number of mesenteric lymph node metastasis, KPS, and 5'-UTR polymorphisms 
      (2R/2R/2R/3R vs. 3R/3R, P<0.001) were significantly associated with DFS. 
      Meanwhile, gender (female vs. male, P=0.025) and adjuvant radiotherapy (yes vs. 
      no, P=0.025) were significantly associated with OS. Multivariate Cox regression 
      showed that KPS score (HR =0.947, P=0.007), TS 5'-UTR polymorphism (HR =0.455, 
      P=0.004) were independent prognostic factors for DFS. Whereas, KPS score was the 
      only independent prognostic factors for OS (HR =0.910, P=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: TS 
      5'-UTR tandem repeat polymorphisms had potential utilization for personalized 
      therapy in Chinese population.

AB  - Purpose: Osteonecrosis is a significant toxicity resulting from the treatment of 
      pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). This study aimed to investigate the 
      relationship between vitamin D receptor fok1 (VDR fok1) and thymidylate synthase 
      (TYMS) gene polymorphisms with the glucocorticoid (GC) induced osteonecrosis (ON) 
      in Egyptian pediatric ALL patients. In addition, to identify the possible 
      association of genetic polymorphisms with other factors such as gender and ALL 
      subtypes. Patients and Methods: A retrospective case-control study was conducted 
      on 102 pediatric ALL patients under the age of 18 who were treated at Children 
      Cancer Hospital Egypt according to St Jude SR/HR total XV protocol. The recruited 
      patients were composed of 51 cases who developed GC-induced osteonecrosis and 51 
      age- and gender-matched patients who received glucocorticoids but remained 
      osteonecrosis-free (controls). Genotyping of the VDR fok1 and TYMS genes was 
      performed using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and conventional 
      PCR, respectively. Results: For the total 102 studied patients, the VDR fok1 
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) frequency distribution were TT (8.8%), CT 
      (34.3%), and CC (56.9%), while the TYMS tandem repeat gene variations were 
      reported as 2R2R (20.6%), 2R3R (45.1%), and 3R3R (34.3%). VDR fok1 and TYMS 
      polymorphic variants showed no association neither with gender; P-values 0.3808 
      and 0.1503, respectively, nor with ALL subtypes; P-values 0.9396 and 0.6596, 
      respectively. The VDR fok1 polymorphisms showed a significant association with 
      the development of ON; P-value = 0.003, on the other hand, TYMS tandem repeats 
      did not show significant impact on osteonecrosis development; P-value = 0.411. 
      Conclusion: This study showed a significant association between the VDR fok1 
      polymorphism and osteonecrosis. Such clinical pharmacogenetics results would be 
      promising to discuss the possibility of dose adjustments aiming a regimen with 
      the highest efficacy and least toxicity.

TI  - Influence of MSI and 18q LOH markers on capecitabine adjuvant monotherapy in 
      colon cancer patients.

LID - 10.2147/PGPM.S172467 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether pretreatment analysis of 
      selected molecular markers can be used for the prediction of disease-free 
      survival (DFS)/overall survival (OS) of capecitabine adjuvant monotherapy in 
      colon cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 126 patients enrolled in 
      a capecitabine Phase IV clinical trial were analyzed for microsatellite 
      instability (MSI), 18q loss of heterozygosity (LOH), thymidylate synthase (TYMS) 
      5' variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR), and methylene tetrahydrofolate 
      reductase (MTHFR) C677T variants. The significance in predicting 5-year DFS/OS 
      was assessed by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses. RESULTS: The MSI-high 
      (MSI-H) genotype was significantly associated with DFS (HR 0.205, 95% CI 
      0.05-0.88, P=0.033) and OS (HR 0.208, 95% CI 0.05-0.89, P=0.035) compared to the 
      microsatellite stable genotype. In models stratified according to 
      clinicopathologic characteristics, the MSI-H genotype remained a positive 
      predictive factor for DFS/OS only in patients with stage III (P=0.023) and 
      patients with tumors localized proximally to the splenic flexure (P=0.004). 
      Distal colon cancers with 18q LOH have a greater survival rate when treated with 
      capecitabine than patients with stable tumors (81.3% vs 50.0%, HR for relapse 
      0.348, 95% CI 0.13-0.97, P=0.043). TYMS 5'VNTR and MTHFR C677T variants were not 
      associated with DFS or OS. CONCLUSION: MSI and 18q LOH markers have the potential 
      to be utilized in the selection of colon cancer patients eligible for 
      capecitabine adjuvant monotherapy.

TI  - The role of genetic polymorphisms in the thymidylate synthase (TYMS) gene in 
      methotrexate-induced oral mucositis in children with acute lymphoblastic 
      leukemia.
PG  - 223-229
LID - 10.1097/FPC.0000000000000352 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Methotrexate (MTX) is an important drug in the treatment of pediatric 
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). MTX is cytotoxic as it impairs DNA and RNA 
      synthesis by inhibiting the enzymes dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and 
      thymidylate synthase (TYMS). The association between genetic variants within the 
      TYMS gene and MTX-induced toxicity has been studied, but results are 
      inconsistent. We determined the role of three previously described variants 
      within the TYMS gene and MTX-induced oral mucositis in a prospective cohort of 
      Dutch children with ALL and performed a meta-analysis of the previous results. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the presence of a 28-base pair tandem repeat 
      (rs34743033; 2R3R), a single nucleotide polymorphism present within the 28-base 
      pair repeat on the 3R allele (rs2853542; 3RG>C) and a 6-base pair deletion 
      (rs15126436; TTAAAG) within the TYMS gene in germline DNA of 117 pediatric 
      patients with ALL. Oral mucositis was defined as grade>/=3 according to the 
      National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
      v.3.0. Data were analyzed for the individual rs34743033 (2R3R) and rs151264360 
      (6 bp deletion) polymorphisms, whereas rs2853542 (3RG>C) was combined with 
      rs34743033 (2R3R) and analyzed according to predicted expression levels of TYMS: 
      low expression (2R/2R, 2R/3RC and 3RC/3RC), median expression (2R/3RG and 
      3RC/3RG) and high expression (3RG/3RG). We performed a meta-analysis of the 
      current literature on these polymorphisms in relation to oral mucositis using a 
      fixed effects model. RESULTS: The 2R2R genotype (rs34743033) was not 
      significantly associated with developing MTX-induced oral mucositis compared with 
      the 2R3R/3R3R genotypes, which was confirmed in a meta-analysis [odds ratio (OR): 
      1.17 (0.62-2.19)]. Patients carrying the low-expression TYMS genotype (2R2R, 
      2R3RC, 3RC3RC) had an increased odds of developing MTX-induced oral mucositis 
      [OR: 2.42 (0.86-6.80)], which did not reach statistical significance. The 6-bp 
      deletion [rs151264360, OR: 0.79 (0.20-3.19)] was not associated with the 
      development of MTX-induced oral mucositis. CONCLUSION: The TYMS 6-bp deletion and 
      2R3R polymorphism were not associated with MTX-induced oral mucositis. Validation 
      studies in prospective cohorts are necessary to assess the possible role of the 
      low-expression TYMS genotypes in relation to MTX-induced oral mucositis.

AB  - Age at onset of Huntington disease, an inherited neurodegenerative disorder, is 
      influenced by the size of the disease-causing CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion 
      in HTT and by genetic modifier loci on chromosomes 8 and 15. Stratifying by 
      modifier genotype, we have examined putamen volume, total motor score (TMS), and 
      symbol digit modalities test (SDMT) scores, both at study entry and 
      longitudinally, in normal controls and CAG-expansion carriers who were enrolled 
      prior to the emergence of manifest HD in the PREDICT-HD study. The modifiers, 
      which included onset-hastening and onset-delaying alleles on chromosome 15 and an 
      onset-hastening allele on chromosome 8, revealed no major effect in controls but 
      distinct patterns of modification in prediagnosis HD subjects. Putamen volume at 
      study entry showed evidence of reciprocal modification by the chromosome 15 
      alleles, but the rate of loss of putamen volume was modified only by the 
      deleterious chromosome 15 allele. By contrast, both alleles modified the rate of 
      change of the SDMT score, but neither had an effect on the TMS. The influence of 
      the chromosome 8 modifier was evident only in the rate of TMS increase. The data 
      indicate that (1) modification of pathogenesis can occur early in the 
      prediagnosis phase, (2) the modifier loci act in genetic interaction with the HD 
      mutation rather than through independent additive effects, and (3) HD subclinical 
      phenotypes are differentially influenced by each modifier, implying distinct 
      effects in different cells or tissues. Together, these findings indicate the 
      potential benefit of using genetic modifier strategies for dissecting the 
      prediagnosis pathogenic process in HD.

PG  - 901-910
LID - 10.1007/s11033-018-4236-2 [doi]
AB  - In view of high mortality associated with coronary artery disease (CAD), 
      development of an early predicting tool will be beneficial in reducing the burden 
      of the disease. The database comprising demographic, conventional, 
      folate/xenobiotic genetic risk factors of 648 subjects (364 cases of CAD and 284 
      healthy controls) was used as the basis to develop CAD risk and percentage 
      stenosis prediction models using ensemble machine learning algorithms (EMLA), 
      multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) and recursive partitioning (RP). The 
      EMLA model showed better performance than other models in disease (89.3%) and 
      stenosis prediction (82.5%). This model depicted hypertension and alcohol intake 
      as the key predictors of CAD risk followed by cSHMT C1420T, GCPII C1561T, 
      diabetes, GSTT1, CYP1A1 m2, TYMs 5'-UTR 28 bp tandem repeat and MTRR A66G. MDR 
      and RP models are in agreement in projecting increasing age, hypertension and 
      cSHMTC1420T as the key determinants interacting in modulating CAD risk. Receiver 
      operating characteristic curves exhibited clinical utility of the developed 
      models in the following order: EMLA (C = 0.96) > RP (C = 0.83) > MDR (C = 0.80). 
      The stenosis prediction model showed that xenobiotic pathway genetic variants 
      i.e. CYP1A1 m2 and GSTT1 are the key determinants of percentage of stenosis. 
      Diabetes, diet, alcohol intake, hypertension and MTRR A66G are the other 
      determinants of stenosis. These eleven variables contribute towards 82.5% 
      stenosis. To conclude, the EMLA model exhibited higher predictability both in 
      terms of disease prediction and stenosis prediction. This can be attributed to 
      higher number of iterations in EMLA model that can increase the prediction 
      accuracy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Deficits in posture and gait are known to contribute to the complex 
      motor phenotype of Huntington disease (HD). Objective and quantitative measures 
      of posture and gait provided by posturography and GAITRite((R)) assessments may 
      supplement categorical rating scales such as the UHDRS-TMS and increase power and 
      sensitivity of clinical trials. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether posturography 
      and GAITRite((R)) measures reveal (1) changes in manifest or premanifest HD 
      mutation-carriers, (2) a correlation to the UHDRS-TMS and functional measures in 
      manifest HD, and (3) a correlation to the disease-burden-score (based on 
      CAG-repeat-length and age). METHODS: Posturography and GAITRite((R)) were applied 
      in premanifest (n...=...26) and manifest HD gene-mutation-carriers (n...=...40) in 
      different paradigms compared to age-matched controls (n...=...30) in a 
      cross-sectional multi-site study conducted in three centers. Subjects were 
      assessed clinically with the UHDRS Total-Motor-Score, Total-Functional-Capacity 
      and Functional-Assessment-Scale. RESULTS: Several posturography measures were 
      able to discriminate between controls, premanifest, and manifest 
      mutation-carriers in both conditions assessed. Only one GAITRite((R)) measure 
      separated controls and premanifest participants, while discrimination between 
      controls and manifest same as between premanifest and manifest participants was 
      possible in several measures. Correlation with all clinical measures was seen in 
      only one measure per device while correlations to the disease-burden-score seen 
      in posturography only. CONCLUSION: Overall the results suggests that 
      posturography detects alterations in premanifest and manifest mutation-carriers 
      more reliably than GAITRite((R)) measures. Correlations with clinical assessment 
      scores are limited; correlation with disease-burden-score is seen in 
      posturography only. Data acquisition and analysis was easier with posturography 
      than GAITRite((R)) assessments in out-patient settings.

TI  - XRCC3 Thr241Met and TYMS variable number tandem repeat polymorphisms are 
      associated with time-to-metastasis in colorectal cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Metastasis is a major cause of mortality in cancer. Identifying 
      prognostic factors that distinguish patients who will experience metastasis in 
      the short-term and those that will be free of metastasis in the long-term is of 
      particular interest in current medical research. The objective of this study was 
      to examine if select genetic polymorphisms can differentiate colorectal cancer 
      patients based on timing and long-term risk of metastasis. METHODS: The patient 
      cohort consisted of 402 stage I-III colorectal cancer patients with 
      microsatellite instability (MSI)-low (MSI-L) or microsatellite stable (MSS) 
      tumors. We applied multivariable mixture cure model, which is the proper model 
      when there is a substantial group of patients who remain free of metastasis in 
      the long-term, to 26 polymorphisms. Time-dependent receiver operator 
      characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine the change in 
      discriminatory accuracy of the models when the significant SNPs were included. 
      RESULTS: After adjusting for significant baseline characteristics, two 
      polymorphisms were significantly associated with time-to-metastasis: TT and TC 
      genotypes of the XRCC3 Thr241Met (p = 0.042) and the 3R/3R genotype of TYMS 
      5'-UTR variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) (p = 0.009) were associated with 
      decreased time-to-metastasis. ROC curves showed that the discriminatory accuracy 
      of the model is increased slightly when these polymorphisms were added to the 
      significant baseline characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate XRCC3 
      Thr241Met and TYMS 5'-UTR VNTR polymorphisms are associated with 
      time-to-metastasis, and may have potential biological roles in expediting the 
      metastatic process. Once replicated, these associations could contribute to the 
      development of precision medicine for colorectal cancer patients.

TI  - Neuro-fuzzy model of homocysteine metabolism.
PG  - 919-926
AB  - In view of well-documented association of hyperhomocysteinaemia with a wide 
      spectrum of diseases and higher incidence of vitamin deficiencies in Indians, we 
      proposed a mathematical model to forecast the role of demographic and genetic 
      variables in influencing homocysteinemetabolism and investigated the influence of 
      life style modulations in controlling homocysteine levels. Total plasma 
      homocysteine levels were measured in fasting samples using reverse phase HPLC. 
      Multiple linear regression (MLR) and neuro-fuzzy models were developed. The MLR 
      model explained 64% variability in homocysteine, while the neurofuzzy model 
      showed higher accuracy in predicting homocysteine with a mean absolute error of 
      0.00002 mumol/L. Methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T, 
      5-methyltetrahydrofolate homocysteine methyltransferase (MTR) A2756G and 5- 
      methyltetrahydrofolate homocysteine methyltransferase reductase (MTRR) A66G were 
      shown to be positively associatiated with homocysteine, while nonvegetarian diet, 
      serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 (SHMT1) C1420T and TYMS 5'-UTR 28 bp tandem 
      repeat exhibited negative association with homocysteine. The protective role of 
      SHMT1 C1420T was attributed to more H-bonding interactions in the mutant modelled 
      compared to the wild type, as shown through in silico analysis. To conclude, 
      polymorphisms in genes regulating remethylation of homocysteine strongly 
      influence homocysteine levels. The restoration of one-carbon homeostasis by SHMT1 
      C1420T or increased flux of folate towards remethylation due to TYMS 5'-UTR 28 bp 
      tandem repeat or nonvegetarian diet can lower homocysteine levels.

TI  - The thymidylate synthase enhancer region (TSER) polymorphism increases the risk

AB  - BACKGROUND: Myasthenia Gravis (MG) is caused, in approximately 80% of the 
      patients, by autoantibodies against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR). 
      The disease is often associated with pathological changes of the thymus: thymic 
      epithelial tumours are present in about 10-20% of the patients, while up to 80% 
      of the patients with early disease onset have thymic hyperplasia. Folate 
      metabolism is required for the production of DNA precursors and for proper DNA 
      methylation reactions, and impaired folate metabolism has been often associated 
      with cellular growth and cancer. METHODS: We investigated if major polymorphisms 
      of folate-related genes, namely MTHFR c.677C>T, MTR c.2756A>G, MTRR c.66A>G and 
      TYMS TSER (a 28-bp tandem repeat in the 5' promoter enhancer region of TYMS) 
      increase the risk of pathological changes of the thymus in AChR+ MG patients. A 
      total of 526 AChR+ MG patients, including 132 patients with normal (involuted) 
      thymus, 146 patients with thymic hyperplasia, and 248 patients with a thymoma 
      were included in the study. Allele and genotype comparisons were performed among 
      the three study groups, after correcting for multiple testing. RESULTS: The 
      frequency of the TYMS TSER 3R allele was significantly higher in MG patients with 
      thymic hyperplasia (P=0.004), and the TYMS TSER 3R3R genotype was significantly 
      associated with increased risk of thymic hyperplasia [OR 2.71 (95% CI: 
      1.34-5.47)]. CONCLUSIONS: The 3R allele in the thymidylate synthase promoter 
      enhancer region results in increased protein production, required for the 
      synthesis of DNA precursors. The present study suggests that the TYMS TSER 3R 
      allele increases the risk of thymic lymphoid hyperplasia in AChR+ MG patients.

TI  - Distribution of the most common polymorphisms in TYMS gene in Slavic population 
      of central Europe.

AB  - Thymidylate synthetase (TS) plays a critical role in the de novo synthesis of 
      dTMP inside the cell. Therefore, TS is a suitable target for cytotoxic drugs such 
      as fluoropyrimidines. Drug efficacy and toxicity depend on the intracellular 
      level of TS, which is significantly influenced by the polymorphisms in the 5'UTR 
      (TSER - rs45445694, TSER*3G>C - rs2853542) and 3'UTR (1494del TTAAAG - 
      rs151264360) of TYMS gene. Polymorphic variants of TYMS gene affect TS activity 
      via gene expression and transcript stability. Patients who undergo 
      fluoropyrimidine therapy may benefit from genetic testing prior to the 
      administration of chemotherapy. At the 5' terminus of TYMS, there is a 
      polymorphic region represented by a variable number of 28bp long tandem repeats 
      (2-9 tandems) with the G or C nucleotide variant (SNP G>C). The 3'end of TYMS 
      gene may decrease the stability of mRNA in the case of 6 base deletion (1494del6, 
      D). In our study, we have focused on testing of TYMS gene polymorphisms, 
      determination of TYMS variant frequencies in Western Slavic population and 
      comparison of Slovak population with other populations.We performed 
      identification of 5'UTR (rs45445694 - TSER*2 or TSER*3; rs2853542 - TSER*3G>C; 
      TSER*3+ins6) and 3'UTR (rs151264360/1494del6/D) polymorphic regions of TYMS gene 
      among 96 volunteers by PCR-RFLP and fragment analysis. Slovak frequencies of 
      selected polymorphisms were established as follows: the frequency of TSER*2, 
      TSER*3, TSER*3G>C, 1494del6/D and I to be 41%, 59%, 34%, 37.5% and 62.5% 
      respectively. The high resolution of the capillary electrophoresis technique 
      allowed among TSER*3 group identification of a subgroup of four individuals with 
      rare 6bp insertion in 3R allele, id est 2.1% TSER*3+ins6 allele frequency. In our 
      study, we have revealed individuals with rare G>C substitution in the first 28bp 
      tandem repeat of TSER*2 promoter enhancer region (rs183205964) as well, the 
      overall frequency of this polymorphic allele in Slovak population was 2.1%. Our 
      results proved that Slovak population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and 
      proportion of TYMS polymorphisms is in accordance with other published data.

TI  - Effect of thymidylate synthase (TYMS) gene polymorphisms with methotrexate 
      treatment outcome in south Indian Tamil patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
PG  - 1253-1259
LID - 10.1007/s10067-017-3608-7 [doi]
AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease causing joint 
      damage and significant functional impairment. Methotrexate (MTX) remains the 
      mainstay for the treatment of RA. MTX inhibits several enzymes of the folate and 
      nucleotide pathways. Thymidylate synthase (TYMS) is an important enzyme in the de 
      novo pyrimidine pathway responsible for DNA replication. The two common gene 
      polymorphisms analyzed in TYMS are 28-bp tandem repeat polymorphism and a 6-bp 
      insertion/deletion polymorphism. The present study was carried out to find the 
      role of these TYMS gene polymorphisms with clinical phenotype, treatment 
      response, and MTX adverse events in 254 patients with RA of south Indian Tamil 
      ethnicity. TYMS gene polymorphisms were analyzed by PCR. The allele frequencies 
      of TYMS gene polymorphisms did not differ between good and non-responders. 
      However, the TYMS 28-bp tandem repeat 3R allele was higher in non-responders than 
      in patients undergoing remission [64 vs 51.11%, p = 0.06, OR 0.58, 95% CI 
      (0.34-1.00)]. The TYMS 6-bp deletion allele was higher in non-responders than 
      good responders [78.20 vs 64.92%, p = 0.06, OR 0.51 95% CI (0.27-0.98)]. TYMS 3R 
      allele and TYMS 6-bp deletion allele may favor non-response to MTX in south 
      Indian Tamils. TYMS gene polymorphisms did not influence MTX adverse events.

AB  - Capecitabine, an oral prodrug of 5-FU, has been approved by the FDA for use in 
      patients with breast and colon cancers. In addition, capecitabine is commonly 
      used in patients with other malignancies such as pancreatic, gastroesophageal, 
      and hepatobiliary tract cancers. Though cerebellar toxicity is a rare but 
      well-known side effect of intravenous 5-FU therapy, peripheral neuropathy with 
      capecitabine has only been described in rare cases. In this case report, we 
      describe a 79-year-old patient with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the 
      pancreas undergoing chemoradiation therapy with capecitabine who developed 
      peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the 
      first patient in the literature who was found to have two mutations (2R) of a 28 
      base-pair tandem repeat in the 5' promoter enhancer region (5'-TSER) on both 
      alleles (2R/2R) of thymidylate synthetase (TYMS) gene, possibly responsible for 
      the neurotoxicity.

AB  - To investigate the impacts of gene variations on survival outcomes of advanced 
      gastric cancer (AGC) patients treated with 5...fluorouracil (5-FU)-based 
      chemotherapy, we analyzed the associations of 2 indels of the TS gene rs34743033 
      (double or triple tandem repeats of a 28 bp sequence in 5'-UTR, denoted as 2R or 
      3R allele) and rs16430 (a 6 bp variation at 1494 bp in 3'-UTR, denoted as ins6 or 
      del6 allele) and 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ABCB1gene rs2032582 
      in exon 21 and rs1045642 in exon 26, with clinical outcomes after 5...FU treatment. 
      Generally, indels rs34743033 and rs16430 were genotyped by PCR and polyacrylamide 
      gel electrophoresis assay and SNPs rs2032582 and rs1045642 were genotyped by 
      polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) 
      assay in 110 Chinese AGC patients post-chemotherapy. Cox regression analysis was 
      used to analyze the risk factors affecting patient survival. As a result, 
      rs34743033, rs1045642 and rs2032582 were shown to be significantly associated 
      with overall survival (P < 0.05), and associations between the four polymorphisms 
      with disease-free survival were also observed (P < 0.05). Moreover, we found that 
      genotypes rs34743033 3R/2R, rs16430 ins6/del6, rs1045642 CC or CT, and 
      rs2032582 GG were beneficial predictors of clinical treatment outcome in AGC 
      patients, suggesting some clinical implications in chemotherapy of a Chinese 
      population.

TI  - Making Home Sweet and Sturdy: Toxoplasma gondii ppGalNAc-Ts Glycosylate in 
      Hierarchical Order and Confer Cyst Wall Rigidity.
LID - 10.1128/mBio.02048-16 [doi]
LID - e02048-16
AB  - The protozoan intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii forms latent cysts in the 
      central nervous system (CNS) and persists for the lifetime of the host. This cyst 
      is cloaked with a glycosylated structure called the cyst wall. Previously, we 
      demonstrated that a mucin-like glycoprotein, CST1, localizes to the cyst wall and 
      confers structural rigidity on brain cysts in a mucin-like domain-dependent 
      manner. The mucin-like domain of CST1 is composed of 20 units of threonine-rich 
      tandem repeats that are O-GalNAc glycosylated. A family of enzymes termed 
      polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (ppGalNAc-Ts) initiates O-GalNAc 
      glycosylation. To identify which isoforms of ppGalNAc-Ts are responsible for the 
      glycosylation of the CST1 mucin-like domain and to evaluate the function of each 
      ppGalNAc-T in the overall glycosylation of the cyst wall, all five ppGalNAc-T 
      isoforms were deleted individually from the T. gondii genome. The ppGalNAc-T2 and 
      -T3 deletion mutants produced various glycosylation defects on the cyst wall, 
      implying that many cyst wall glycoproteins are glycosylated by T2 and T3. Both T2 
      and T3 glycosylate the CST1 mucin-like domain, and this glycosylation is 
      necessary for CST1 to confer structural rigidity on the cyst wall. We established 
      that T2 is required for the initial glycosylation of the mucin-like domain and 
      that T3 is responsible for the sequential glycosylation on neighboring acceptor 
      sites, demonstrating hierarchical glycosylation by two distinct initiating and 
      filling-in ppGalNAc-Ts in an intact organism. IMPORTANCE: Toxoplasma gondii is an 
      obligate intracellular parasite that infects a third of the world's population. 
      It can cause severe congenital disease and devastating encephalitis in 
      immunocompromised individuals. We identified two glycosyltransferases, 
      ppGalNAc-T2 and -T3, which are responsible for glycosylating cyst wall proteins 
      in a hierarchical fashion. This glycosylation confers structural rigidity on the 
      brain cyst. Our studies provide new insights into the mechanisms of O-GalNAc 
      glycosylation in T. gondii.

TI  - Pharmacogenetic variants associated with outcome in patients with advanced 
      gastric cancer treated with fluoropyrimidine and platinum-based triplet 
      combinations: a pooled analysis of three prospective studies.
PG  - 441-451
LID - 10.1038/tpj.2016.81 [doi]
AB  - The main treatment for advanced gastric cancer is fluoropyrimidine and 
      platinum-based chemotherapy. We investigated the clinical validitiy of 19 
      candidate pharmacogenetic variants in ENOSF1 (enolase superfamily member 1), 
      TYMS, CDA, MTHFR, TYMP, DPYD, ERCC1, ERCC2, GSTP1, GSTT1, GSTM1, CYP3A4 and 
      CYP3A5 in relation to overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, objective 
      response rate (ORR) and toxicity in 185 patients receiving triplet chemotherapy. 
      The formal significance threshold was P<0.0026. TYMS VNTR (variable number of 
      28-bp tandem repeats) 3 R/3 R genotype was formally associated with inferior ORR 
      (odds ratio (OR) 0.3, P=0.0025), whereas ENOSF1 rs2612091 G/G was nominally 
      associated with OS after adjustment for TYMS 3 R/3 R (hazard ratio (HR) 1.5, 
      P=0.041). In a subgroup analysis of patients with locally advanced disease 
      (n=33), ENOSF1 rs2612091 was strongly associated with OS (HR 6.5, P=0.001). 
      CYP3A4*22/CYP3A5*3 genotype was nominally associated with grade 3/4 toxicity in 
      patients receiving docetaxel-containing chemotherapy (P=0.0175). This is the 
      first study suggesting that ENOSF1 rs2612091 is prognostic or predictive of OS in 
      gastric cancer. This finding requires prospective validation.

TI  - Identification of extreme motor phenotypes in Huntington's disease.
PG  - 283-294
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.b.32514 [doi]
AB  - The manifestation of motor signs in Huntington's disease (HD) has a well-known 
      inverse relationship with HTT CAG repeat length, but the prediction is far from 
      perfect. The probability of finding disease modifiers is enhanced in individuals 
      with extreme HD phenotypes. We aimed to identify extreme HD motor phenotypes 
      conditional on CAG and age, such as patients with very early or very late onset 
      of motor manifestation. Retrospective data were available from 1,218 healthy 
      controls and 9,743 HD participants with CAG repeats >/=40, and a total of about 
      30,000 visits. Boundaries (2.5% and 97.5% quantiles) for extreme motor phenotypes 
      (UHDRS total motor score (TMS) and motor age-at-onset) were estimated using 
      quantile regression for longitudinal data. More than 15% of HD participants had 
      an extreme TMS phenotype for at least one visit. In contrast, only about 4% of 
      participants were consistent TMS extremes at two or more visits. Data from 
      healthy controls revealed an upper cut-off of 13 for the TMS representing the 
      extreme of motor ratings for a normal aging population. In HD, boundaries of 
      motor age-at-onset based on diagnostic confidence or derived from the TMS data 
      cut-off in controls were similar. In summary, a UHDRS TMS of more than 13 in an 
      individual carrying the HD mutation indicates a high likelihood of motor 
      manifestations of HD irrespective of CAG repeat length or age. The identification 
      of motor phenotype extremes can be useful in the search for disease modifiers, 
      for example, genetic or environmental such as medication. (c) 2016 Wiley

TI  - Telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) related to polycystic ovary syndrome 
      (PCOS).
PG  - 552-559
LID - 10.1111/cen.13283 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) participates in the regulation 
      of telomere length, and leucocyte telomere length (LTL) plays an important role 
      in the pathophysiology of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), but little is known 
      about the role of TERRA in PCOS. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of TERRA and 
      peripheral blood LTL in PCOS. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Forty women with PCOS and 
      35 healthy women without PCOS were recruited. A prospective case-control study 
      was performed. MEASUREMENTS: RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was 
      used to detect TERRA expression in peripheral blood leucocyte. Quantitative PCR 
      was used to measure TERRA expression and the mean LTL in the PCOS and control 
      groups. We analysed the association between related clinical parameters and the 
      age-adjusted ratio of the telomere repeat length (T/S ratio) or TERRA. RESULTS: 
      Telomeric repeat-containing RNA was expressed in human peripheral blood 
      leucocytes, and the signal was abolished after culture with RNase A. The 
      age-adjusted LTLs were significantly longer in the PCOS group than in the control 
      group (P < 0.01). The age-adjusted TERRA level was significantly lower in the 
      PCOS group than in the control group (P < 0.01). Testosterone (TTE) was related 
      positively to LTL and negatively to TERRA in the PCOS group (r = 0.532, P = 
      0.002; r = -0.477, P = 0.017). CONCLUSION: We found TERRA expression in human 
      peripheral blood leucocytes, and LTLs were positively associated with PCOS. TERRA 
      and testosterone play an important role in the LTL regulation in PCOS.

TI  - Thymidylate synthase polymorphism in Mexican patients with colon cancer treated 
      with 5-fluorouracil.
PG  - 935-940
AB  - PURPOSE: We analyzed the genotype and allele frequency of variable number tandem 
      repeats (VNTR)-thymidylate synthase (TS) and its relationship with the disease 
      evolution in colon cancer patients. METHODS: We selected 24 paraffin-embedded 
      colon cancer tissue samples from Mexican patients who received a 5-fluorouracil 
      (5-FU)-based chemotherapy regimen. Tumor tissue was digested with proteinase K 
      and genomic DNA was isolated by the standard method with phenol-chloroform 
      extraction. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed for TS genotyping of 
      VNTR and the results were evaluated directly in a stained agarose gel. RESULTS: 
      The allele frequency of 2 repeats (2R) was greater (0.66) than 3R (0.34) in 
      metastatic colon cancer (x(2)=10.24; p=0.001)) however, no difference in allelic 
      distribution between 2R (0.54) and 3R (0.46) in non metastatic patients was 
      observed (x(2)=0.640; p=0.424). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that Mexican 
      patients with colon cancer present differences in the allelic distribution, the 
      2R allele being the most frequent.

AB  - Population-based screening for CGG-repeat expansions in the fragile X mental 
      retardation 1 (FMR1) gene that cause fragile X syndrome can now be performed more 
      cost-effectively and simply by combining direct triplet-primed PCR (dTP-PCR) with 
      melting curve analysis (MCA). We have now performed a detailed technical 
      validation to define the operational parameters for achieving robust and reliable 
      performance of the FMR1 dTP-PCR MCA assay. We compared the assay's performance on 
      2 real-time PCR platforms and determined its analytic sensitivity and 
      specificity. We also assessed the assay's performance on DNA isolated from 
      different sources, the effect of differences in CGG-repeat length and 
      AGG-interruption pattern on melt peak temperature (Tm), and the effect of common 
      substances found in DNA solutions on Tms. The assay performed well in 
      distinguishing normal from expansion-carrying samples. The assay had detection 
      sensitivity down to 1 ng and an analytical specificity beyond 150 ng. In addition 
      to peripheral blood DNA, analysis could also be performed on DNA from saliva, 
      buccal swabs, and dried blood spots. Salt increased Tms, glycogen contamination 
      had minimal effect, whereas AGG interruptions lowered Tms. The FMR1 dTP-PCR MCA 
      screening assay is highly sensitive and specific, performs well using DNA from 
      different sources, and is robust and reproducible when reagent concentrations are 
      maintained across all tested samples.

TI  - Tandem repeats of TSER significantly influence the efficacy of 5-fluorouracil in 
      the treatment of plantar warts.

AB  - AIM: To identify potential genetic risk markers associated with 5-fluorouracil 
      (5-FU) treatment outcomes in plantar warts patients. METHODS: In this study, 126 
      plantar warts patients were treated with an intralesional mixture of 5-FU, 
      lidocaine and epinephrine. Treatment outcomes were compared with DNA mutation 
      analysis. RESULTS: More patients with TSER 3R/3R genotype failed 5-FU treatment 
      than TSER 2R/3R+2R/2R (72.1 vs 43.8%; odds ratio: 3.32; 95% CI: 1.26-8.72; p = 
      0.013). In addition, the regression modeling identified patient age and TSER 3R 
      allele as covariates of the risk of 5-FU treatment failure (p = 0.025). 
      CONCLUSION:  TSER 3R/3R of TYMS gene was found to be the major risk of treatment 
      failure. This genetic marker provides a potential treatment stratification target 
      to modulate 5-FU treatment in plantar wart patients.

TI  - Thymidylate Synthase Polymorphisms and Risk of Lung Cancer among the Jordanian 
      Population: a Case Control Study.
PG  - 8287-92
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thymidylate synthase (TS) catalyzes the methylation of deoxyuridylate 
      to deoxythymidylate and is involved in DNA methylation, synthesis and repair. Two 
      common polymorphisms have been reported, tandem repeats in the promoter-enhancer 
      region (TSER), and 6bp ins/del in the 5'UTR, that are implicated in a number of 
      human diseases, including cancer. The association between the two polymorphisms 
      in risk for lung cancer (LC) was here investigated in the Jordanian population. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: An age, gender, and smoking-matched case-control study 
      involving 84 lung cancer cases and 71 controls was conducted. The polymerase 
      chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique was 
      used to detect the polymorphism of interest. RESULTS: Individuals bearing the 
      ins/ins genotype were 2.5 times more likely to have lung cancer [(95%CI: 
      0.98-6.37), p=0.051]. Individuals who were less than or equal to 57 years and 
      carrying ins/ins genotype were 4.6 times more susceptible to lung cancer [OR<57 
      vs >57years: 4.6 (95%CI: 0.93-22.5), p=0.059)]. Genotypes and alleles of TSER 
      were distributed similarly between cases and controls. Weak linkage 
      disequilibrium existed between the two loci of interest (Lewontin's coefficient 
      [D']) (LC: D' =0.03, r2: 0. 001, p= 0.8; CONTROLS: D' =0.29, r2: 0.08, p=0.02). 
      Carriers of the "3 tandem repeats_insertion" haplotype (3R_ins) were 2 times more 
      likely to have lung cancer [2 (95%CI: 1.13-3.48), p=0.061]. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic 
      polymorphism of TS at 3; UTR and its haplotype analysis may modulate the risk of 
      lung cancer in Jordanians. The 6bp ins/del polymorphism of TS at 3 ;UTR is more 
      informative than TSER polymorphism in predicting increased risk.

AB  - Huntington disease (HD), a neurodegenerative disorder caused by CAG repeat 
      expansion in the gene encoding huntingtin, predominantly affects the striatum, 
      especially the spiny projection neurons (SPN). The striatum receives excitatory 
      input from cortex and thalamus, and the role of the former has been well-studied 
      in HD. Here, we report that mutated huntingtin alters function of thalamostriatal 
      connections. We used a novel thalamostriatal (T-S) coculture and an established 
      corticostriatal (C-S) coculture, generated from YAC128 HD and WT (FVB/NJ 
      background strain) mice, to investigate excitatory neurotransmission onto 
      striatal SPN. SPN in T-S coculture from WT mice showed similar mini-excitatory 
      postsynaptic current (mEPSC) frequency and amplitude as in C-S coculture; 
      however, both the frequency and amplitude were significantly reduced in YAC128 
      T-S coculture. Further investigation in T-S coculture showed similar excitatory 
      synapse density in WT and YAC128 SPN dendrites by immunostaining, suggesting 
      changes in total dendritic length or probability of release as possible 
      explanations for mEPSC frequency changes. Synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 
      (NMDAR) current was similar, but extrasynaptic current, associated with cell 
      death signaling, was enhanced in YAC128 SPN in T-S coculture. Employing optical 
      stimulation of cortical versus thalamic afferents and recording from striatal SPN 
      in brain slice, we found increased glutamate release probability and reduced 
      AMPAR/NMDAR current ratios in thalamostriatal synapses, most prominently in 
      YAC128. Enhanced extrasynaptic NMDAR current in YAC128 SPN was apparent with both 
      cortical and thalamic stimulation. We conclude that thalamic afferents to the 
      striatum are affected early, prior to an overt HD phenotype; however, changes in 
      NMDAR localization in SPN are independent of the source of glutamatergic input.

TI  - The Effectiveness of Pemetrexed Monotherapy Depending on Polymorphisms in TS and 
      MTHFR Genes as Well as Clinical Factors in Advanced NSCLC Patients.
PG  - 49-56
LID - 10.1007/s12253-015-9966-z [doi]
AB  - In NSCLC, second-line chemotherapy using pemetrexed or docetaxel has limited 
      efficacy and should be dedicated to selected groups of patients. Pemetrexed is an 
      antifolate compound with the ability to inhibit enzymes (TS, DHFR and GARFT) 
      involved in pyrimidine and purine synthesis. The objective of this study was to 
      evaluate the association between polymorphisms of TS and MHFR genes and clinical 
      outcomes in NSCLC patients treated with pemetrexed monotherapy. DNA was isolated 
      from peripheral blood of 72 non-squamous NSCLC patients treated with pemetrexed. 
      Using PCR and RFLP methods, the variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR), the 
      G > C SNP in these repeats and insertion/deletion polymorphism of TS gene as well 
      as 677C > T SNP in MTHFR gene were analyzed and correlated with disease control 
      rate, progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) of NSCLC patients. 
      Carriers of 2R/3R(G), 3R(C)/3R(G), 3R(G)/3R(G) genotypes showed significantly 
      more frequent early progression than carriers of 2R/2R, 2R/3R(C), 3R(C)/3R(C) 
      genotypes of TS gene (p < 0.05). Among carriers of triple 28 bp tandem repeats 
      (3R) in TS gene and C/C genotype of MTHFR gene a significantly shorter OS was 
      observed (HR = 3.07; p = 0.003). In multivariate analysis, significantly higher 
      risk of death was observed in carriers of both 3R/3R genotype in TS and C/C 
      genotype in 677C > T SNP in MTHFR (HR = 3.85; p < 0.005) as well as in patients 
      with short duration of response to first-line chemotherapy (HR = 2.09; 
      p < 0.005). Results of our study suggested that genetic factors may have a high 
      predictive and prognostic value (even greater than clinical factors) for patients 
      treated with pemetrexed monotherapy.

TI  - Urban Particulate Matter-Activated Human Dendritic Cells Induce the Expansion of 
      Potent Inflammatory Th1, Th2, and Th17 Effector Cells.
PG  - 250-62

AB  - Exposure to urban particulate matter (UPM) exacerbates asthmatic lung 
      inflammation. Lung dendritic cells (DCs) are critical for stimulating T cell 
      immunity and in maintaining airway tolerance, but they also react to airway UPM. 
      The adjuvant role of UPM in enhancing primary immune responses by naive cells to 
      allergen has been reported, but the direct effects of UPM-activated DCs on the 
      functionality of human memory CD4 T cells (Tms), which constitute the majority of 
      T cells in the lung, has not been investigated. Blood CD1c(+) DCs were purified 
      and activated with UPM in the presence or absence of house dust mite or tetanus 
      toxoid control antigen. 5-(and -6)-Carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl 
      ester-labeled blood Tms were cocultured with autologous DCs, T cell proliferation 
      and effector function were assessed using flow cytometry, and secreted cytokines 
      were measured by combined bead array. UPM-DCs elicited IFN-gamma and IL-13 secretion 
      and induced proliferation in Tms isolated from both allergic patients with asthma 
      and healthy control subjects, whereas only IL-13 was produced by Tms from 
      patients with atopic asthma stimulated by house dust mite-loaded DCs. UPM-DCs 
      drove the expansion and differentiation of a mixed population of Th1, Th2, and 
      Th17 cell effectors through a mechanism that was dependent on major 
      histocompatibility class II but not on cytokine-driven expansion. The data 
      suggest that UPM not only has adjuvant properties but is also a source of antigen 
      that stimulates the generation of Th2, Th1, and Th17 effector phenotypes, which 
      have been implicated in both exacerbations of asthma and chronic inflammatory 
      diseases.

TI  - Increased risk of severe fluoropyrimidine-associated toxicity in patients 
      carrying a G to C substitution in the first 28-bp tandem repeat of the 
      thymidylate synthase 2R allele.
PG  - 245-53

AB  - The fluoropyrimidines act by inhibiting thymidylate synthase (TS). Recent studies 
      have shown that patients' risk of severe fluoropyrimidine-associated toxicity is 
      affected by polymorphisms in the 5'-untranslated region of TYMS, the gene 
      encoding TS. A G>C substitution in the promoter enhancer region of TYMS, 
      rs183205964 (known as the 2RC allele), markedly reduces TS activity in vitro, but 
      its clinical relevance is unknown. We determined rs183205964 in 1605 patients 
      previously enrolled in a prospective multicenter study. Associations between 
      putative low TS expression genotypes (3RC/2RC, 2RG/2RC, and 2RC/2RC) and severe 
      toxicity were investigated using univariable and multivariable logistic 
      regression. Activity of TS and TYMS gene expression were determined in peripheral 
      blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of a patient carrying genotype 2RC/2RC and of a 
      control group of healthy individuals. Among 1,605 patients, 28 patients (1.7%) 
      carried the 2RC allele. Twenty patients (1.2%) carried a risk-associated genotype 
      (2RG/2RC, n=13; 3RC/2RC, n=6; and 2RC/2RC, n=1), the eight remaining patients had 
      genotype 3RG/2RC. Early severe toxicity and toxicity-related hospitalization were 
      significantly more frequent in risk-associated genotype carriers (OR 3.0, 95%CI 
      1.04-8.93, p=0.043 and OR 3.8, 95%CI 1.19-11.9, p=0.024, respectively, in 
      multivariable analysis). The patient with genotype 2RC/2RC was hospitalized twice 
      and had severe febrile neutropenia, diarrhea, and hand-foot syndrome. Baseline TS 
      activity and gene expression in PBMCs of this patient, and a healthy individual 
      with the 2RC allele, were found to be within the normal range. Our study suggests 
      that patients carrying rs183205964 are at strongly increased risk of severe, 
      potentially life-threatening, toxicity when treated with fluoropyrimidines.

TI  - Prognostic implications of thymidylate synthase gene polymorphisms in patients 
      with advanced small bowel adenocarcinoma treated with first-line 
      fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy.
PG  - 155-64
LID - 10.3892/or.2015.3954 [doi]
AB  - Thymidylate synthase (TS) gene polymorphisms such as tandem repeat (TR) 
      polymorphisms and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affect transcriptional 
      efficiency of the TS gene and may be prognostic markers for 
      fluoropyrimidine-based therapy in various gastrointestinal cancers. However, data 
      for TS polymorphisms on clinical outcomes in advanced small bowel adenocarcinoma 
      (SBA) are limited. We retrospectively enrolled 58 locally advanced/metastatic SBA 
      patients treated with first-line fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy and analyzed 
      the relationship between TS genotypes and clinical outcomes in 30 patients who 
      were available for tumor tissue. Based on TR polymorphisms and a G>C SNP in the 
      promoter region of the TS gene, 74% of patients had high TS expression genotypes 
      (2R/3RG, 3RG/3RC, 3RG/3RG); the remainder had low TS expression genotypes (2R/2R, 
      2R/3RC, 3RC/3RC). After a median follow-up of 48.8 months, median 
      progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in all patients were 
      6.0 and 11.3 months, respectively. However, patients with low TS expression 
      genotypes had better median PFS (12.8 vs. 4.3 months, P=0.027) and OS (28.8 vs. 
      8.9 months, P=0.025) than those with high TS expression genotypes. In 
      multivariate analysis, poor Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 
      [hazard ratio (HR), 2.85; 95% CI, 1.02-7.93] and high TS expression genotypes 
      (HR, 3.49; 95% CI, 1.13-10.78) were independent prognostic factors for worse OS. 
      Therefore, TS genotypes, based on a G>C SNP in the TR sequence of the TS gene, 
      may be a useful biomarker for predicting outcomes for fluoropyrimidine-based 
      chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced/metastatic SBA.

AB  - Putatively functional polymorphisms of one-carbon and xenobiotic metabolic 
      pathways influence susceptibility for wide spectrum of diseases. The current 
      study was aimed to explore gene-gene interactions among these two metabolic 
      pathways in four diseases i.e. breast cancer, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 
      coronary artery disease (CAD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Multifactor 
      dimensionality reduction analysis was carried out on four case-control datasets. 
      Cross-talk was observed between one-carbon and xenobiotic pathways in breast 
      cancer (RFC 80 G>A, COMT H108L and TYMS 5'-UTR 28 bp tandem repeat) and SLE 
      (CYP1A1 m1, MTRR 66 A>G and GSTT1). Gene-gene interactions within one-carbon 
      metabolic pathway were observed in CAD (GCPII 1561 C>T, SHMT 1420 C>T and MTHFR 
      677 C>T) and PD (cSHMT 1420 C>T, MTRR 66 A>G and RFC1 80 G>A). These interaction 
      models showed good predictability of risk for PD (The area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic curve (C) = 0.83) and SLE (C = 0.73); and moderate 
      predictability of risk for breast cancer (C = 0.64) and CAD (C = 0.63). 
      Cross-talk between one-carbon and xenobiotic pathways was observed in diseases

TI  - The influence of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthetase 
      gene polymorphisms on lung adenocarcinoma occurrence.
PG  - 1024-8
AB  - PURPOSE: Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and thymidylate synthetase 
      (TYMS) are suggested as risk factors for lung cancer. The purpose of this study 
      was to analyze the association of MTHFR C677T polymorphism and variable number 
      tandem repeat 2R/3R and single nucleotide polymorphism G>C in the 3R allele of 
      the TYMS gene with lung adenocarcinoma. METHODS: A case-control study including 
      lung adenocarcinoma patients and healthy subjects was performed. Restriction 
      fragment length polymorphism analysis was used for genotyping. Descriptive 
      analyses included genotype and allelic frequencies; the odds ratio and 95% 
      confidence interval were calculated as an estimate of relative risk. Significance 
      was set at p<0.05. RESULTS: A significant difference in CC vs TT+CT MTHFR 
      genotype distribution was observed between patients and controls. There was no 
      significant association between the TYMS polymorphisms and the risk of lung 
      adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: The MTHFR 677T allele is likely to have a protective 
      effect against lung adenocarcinoma development.

      breast cancer in a Mexican population.

LID - 10.4238/2014.October.27.16 [doi]
AB  - Breast cancer (BC) is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women in 
      Mexico. Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the thymidylate synthase 
      (TS) gene, the 28-base pair (bp) tandem repeat in the TS 5'-untranslated enhanced 
      region (TSER) and the 6-bp insertion/deletion in the TS 3'-untranslated region 
      (TS 3'-UTR), increase the rate of misincorporation of uridylate into DNA and may 
      lead to chromosomal damage. We examined the association between these 
      polymorphisms and BC risk in Mexican women according to menopause status. Mexican 
      patients with initial BC diagnosis (N = 230) and 145 individuals from a reference 
      general population group (RGP) were included. For statistical analysis, the BC 
      group was divided into pre- and post-menopause groups (PRE and POST groups, 
      respectively). We analyzed both TS polymorphisms (TSER and TS 3'-UTR) using 
      polymerase chain reaction. Finetti analysis was used to evaluate inter-and 
      intra-group differences. The results showed a high frequency for the 3R and ins6 
      alleles in the BC, RGP, PRE, and POST groups. No significant differences were 
      observed for the TS and TSER genotype and allele frequency distributions between 
      groups. We found that the TSER and TS 3'-UTR SNPs are not associated with BC risk 
      in Mexican patients.

TI  - Tyms double (2R) and triple repeat (3R) confers risk for human oral squamous cell 
      carcinoma.
PG  - 7737-42
LID - 10.1007/s11033-014-3494-x [doi]
AB  - The oral cancer is responsible for approximately 3 % of cases of cancer in 
      Brazil. Epidemiological studies have associated low folate intake with an 
      increased risk of epithelial cancers, including oral cancer. Folic acid has a key 
      role in DNA synthesis, repair, methylation and this is the basis of explanations 
      for a putative role for folic acid in cancer prevention. The role of folic acid 
      in carcinogenesis may be modulated by polymorphism C677T in MTHFR and tandem 
      repeats 2R/3R in the promoter site of TYMS gene that are related to decreased 
      enzymatic activity and quantity and availability of the enzyme, respectively. 
      These events cause a decrease in the synthesis, repair and DNA methylation, which 
      can lead to a disruption in the expression of tumor suppressor genes as TP53. The 
      objective of this study was investigate the distribution of polymorphisms C677T 
      and tandem repeats 2R/3R associated with the development of oral squamous cell 
      carcinoma (OSCC). 53 paraffin-embedded samples from patients who underwent 
      surgery but are no longer at the institution and 43 samples collected by method 
      of oral exfoliation by cytobrush were selected. 132 healthy subjects were 
      selected by specialists at the dental clinics of the Faculdade de Odontologia de 
      Pernambuco-FOP. The MTHFR genotyping was performed by PCR-RFLP, and the TYMS 
      genotyping was performed by conventional PCR. Fisher's Exact test at significant 
      level of 5 %. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were used to 
      measure the strength of association between genotype frequency and OSCC 
      development. The results were statistically significant for the tandem repeats of 
      the TYMS gene (p = 0.015). The TYMS 2R3R genotype was significantly associated 
      with the development of OSCC (OR = 3.582; 95 % CI 1.240-10.348; p = 0.0262) and 
      also the genotype 3R3R (OR = 3.553; 95 % CI 1.293-9.760; p = 0.0345). When 
      analyzed together, the TYMS 2R3R + 3R3R genotypes also showed association (OR = 
      3.518; 95 % CI 11.188-10.348; p = 0.0177). No differences for the MTHFR C677T 
      polymorphisms distribution were found between the oral cancer patients and 
      controls subjects in our study (p = 0.499). Therefore, these data suggest that 
      determination of TYMS tandem repeats could provide information on the 
      comprehension of the risk factors and prevention of the OSCC.

AB  - PURPOSE: This phase II study evaluated the response rate (RR) and safety of 
      combination therapy with carboplatin (CBDCA) and pemetrexed (PEM) in Japanese 
      patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (non-sq NSCLC). Further, 
      the relationship between therapy efficacy/toxicity and genetic polymorphisms 
      associated with PEM metabolism was analyzed. METHODS: Forty-one patients received 
      CBDCA at a dose targeting an area under the concentration-time curve of 
      5 mg/mL x min and PEM of 500 mg/m(2) on day 1 every 3 weeks. Single-nucleotide 
      polymorphisms of the thymidylate synthase (TYMS) coding gene, the variable number 
      of tandem repeat (VNTR) in the TYMS, and the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 
      (MTHFR) coding gene were analyzed. RESULTS: The overall RR was 36.6 %. Median 
      progression-free survival and median survival time were 4.7 months [95 % 
      confidence interval (CI) 3.9-5.6 months] and 16.2 months (95 % CI 
      6.1-26.2 months), respectively. Epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutations 
      were detected in 6 patients (14.6 %). The VNTR in the TYMS significantly 
      correlated with anemia (p = 0.047) and thrombocytopenia (p = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS: 
      This combination therapy was effective and tolerable in patients with advanced 
      non-sq NSCLC. The VNTR in the TYMS appears to be a predictive factor for anemia 
      and thrombocytopenia in patients treated with this regimen.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Therapeutic outcome of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients treated 
      with methotrexate (MTX) can be modulated by thymidylate synthase (TS) levels, 
      which may be altered by genetic polymorphisms in TS gene (TYMS). This study aims 
      to elucidate the influence of TYMS polymorphisms in MTX therapeutic outcome 
      (regarding both clinical response and toxicity) in Portuguese RA patients. 
      METHODS: Clinicopathological data from 233 Caucasian RA patients treated with MTX 
      were collected, outcomes were defined and patients were genotyped for the 
      following TYMS polymorphisms: 1) 28 base pairs (bp) variable number tandem repeat 
      (rs34743033); 2) single nucleotide polymorphism C>G (rs2853542); and 3) 6 bp 
      sequence deletion (1494del6, rs34489327). Chi-square and binary logistic 
      regression analyses were performed, using genotype and haplotype-based 
      approaches. RESULTS: Considering TYMS genotypes, 3R3R (p = 0.005, OR = 2.34), 
      3RC3RG (p = 0.016, OR = 3.52) and 6bp- carriers (p = 0.011, OR = 1.96) were 
      associated with non-response to MTX. Multivariate analysis confirmed the 
      increased risk for non-response to MTX in 6bp- carriers (p = 0.016, OR = 2.74). 
      Data demonstrated that TYMS polymorphisms were in linkage disequilibrium 
      (p<0.00001). Haplotype multivariate analysis revealed that haplotypes harboring 
      both 3R and 6bp- alleles were associated with non-response to MTX. Regarding 
      MTX-related toxicity, no statistically significant differences were observed in 
      relation to TYMS genotypes and haplotypes. CONCLUSION: Our study reveals that 
      TYMS polymorphisms could be important to help predicting clinical response to MTX 
      in RA patients. Despite the potential of these findings, translation into 
      clinical practice needs larger studies to confirm these evidences.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We attempted to clarify the association between dopamine receptor D4 
      (DRD4) 48-bp variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism and Tourette's 
      syndrome. METHODS: The DRD4 48-bp VNTR polymorphism was genotyped in 291 
      Tourette's syndrome patients (including 218 trios) and 405 controls. Chi-square 
      and transmission disequilibrium test analysis were used to compare genetic 
      distributions. We retrieved related studies in a meta-analysis to clarify the 
      role of 2-repeat and 4-repeat alleles in the pathogenesis. RESULTS: Obvious 
      genotype and allele distribution differences were observed between patients and 
      healthy controls for both 2-repeat and 4-repeat alleles. This was verified using 
      transmission disequilibrium test analysis. Meta-analysis showed strong 
      associations in both the total population and the Asian population. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The DRD4 48-bp VNTR polymorphism appears to be associated with Tourette's 
      syndrome, with the 2-repeat allele performing a protective role and the 4-repeat 
      allele a nonprotective role in the genesis of the disease.

TI  - Correlation between TS, MTHFR, and ERCC1 gene polymorphisms and the efficacy of 
      platinum in combination with pemetrexed first-line chemotherapy in mesothelioma 
      patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The combination of pemetrexed and platinum compound represents the 
      standard regimen for first-line chemotherapy in malignant pleural mesothelioma 
      patients. Pemetrexed is a multitarget antifolate agent that inhibits 
      folate-dependent enzymes (eg, thymidylate synthase [TS]) and thus synthesis of 
      nucleotides and DNA. Expression of TS and folate availability, regulated by gene 
      polymorphisms, have implications for effectiveness of chemotherapy and the 
      outcome of mesothelioma patients. The aim of this retrospective multicenter study 
      was to assess the correlation between TS, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate 
      reductase (MTHFR) and excision repair cross-complementing group 1 (ERCC1) gene 
      polymorphisms and the efficacy of pemetrexed-based first-line chemotherapy of 
      mesothelioma patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-nine mesothelioma patients (31 
      men with a median age of 62 years) treated in first-line chemotherapy with 
      platinum in combination with pemetrexed or pemetrexed monotherapy were enrolled. 
      Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood. Using polymerase chain reaction 
      and high resolution melt methods, the variable number of tandem repeat, the G>C 
      single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in these repeats, and 6-base pair (bp) 
      insertion/deletion polymorphism of the TS gene, the SNP of 677C>T in MTHFR, and 
      19007C>T in the ERCC1 gene were analyzed and correlated with disease control 
      rate, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) of mesothelioma 
      patients. RESULTS: Greater risk of early disease progression (PD), and shortening 
      of PFS and OS were associated with several clinical factors (eg, anemia for early 
      PD and OS), weight loss (for PFS and OS), and previous surgical treatment (for 
      early PD, PFS, and OS). Insertion of 6-bp in both alleles of the TS gene 
      (1494del6) was the only genetic factor that increased the incidence of early 
      progression (P = .028) and shortening of median PFS (P = .06) in patients treated 
      with pemetrexed-based chemotherapy. In multivariate analysis, the 1494del6 in the 
      3' untranslated region (UTR) of the TS gene also had a predictive role for PFS (P 
      = .0185; hazard ratio, 2.3258 for +6/+6 homozygotes) in analyzed mesothelioma 
      patients. CONCLUSION: Most analyzed polymorphisms in TS, MTHFR, and ERCC1 genes 
      failed to predict outcome in mesothelioma patients treated with pemetrexed-based 
      chemotherapy. However, different variants of 1494del6 in the 3' UTR of the TS 
      gene were associated with differences in disease control rate and PFS of our 
      patients.

TI  - Polymorphisms in TS, MTHFR and ERCC1 genes as predictive markers in first-line 
      platinum and pemetrexed therapy in NSCLC patients.
PG  - 2047-57
LID - 10.1007/s00432-014-1756-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We presented retrospective analysis of up to five polymorphisms in TS, 
      MTHFR and ERCC1 genes as molecular predictive markers for homogeneous Caucasian, 
      non-squamous NSCLC patients treated with pemetrexed and platinum front-line 
      chemotherapy. METHODS: The following polymorphisms in DNA isolated from 115 
      patients were analyzed: various number of 28-bp tandem repeats in 5'-UTR region 
      of TS gene, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within the second tandem repeat 
      of TS gene (G>C); 6-bp deletion in 3'-UTR region of the TS (1494del6); 677C>T SNP 
      in MTHFR; 19007C>T SNP in ERCC1. Molecular examinations' results were correlated 
      with disease control rate, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival. 
      RESULTS: Polymorphic tandem repeat sequence (2R, 3R) in the enhancer region of TS 
      gene and G>C SNP within the second repeat of 3R allele seem to be important for 
      the effectiveness of platinum and pemetrexed in first-line chemotherapy. The 
      insignificant shortening of PFS in 3R/3R homozygotes as compared to 2R/2R and 
      2R/3R genotypes were observed, while it was significantly shorter in patients 
      carrying synchronous 3R allele and G nucleotide. The combined analysis of TS VNTR 
      and MTHFR 677C>T SNP revealed shortening of PFS in synchronous carriers of 3R 
      allele in TS and two C alleles in MTHFR. The strongest factors increased the risk 
      of progression were poor PS, weight loss, anemia and synchronous presence of 3R 
      allele and G nucleotide in the second repeat of 3R allele in TS. Moreover, lack 
      of application of second-line chemotherapy, weight loss and poor performance 
      status and above-mentioned genotype of TS gene increased risk of early mortality. 
      CONCLUSION: The examined polymorphisms should be accounted as molecular predictor 
      factors for pemetrexed- and platinum-based front-line chemotherapy in 
      non-squamous NSCLC patients.

      predictors of treatment toxicity and/or MTX clearance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      This study included 127 Lebanese acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients, of whom 
      117 were treated following the St Jude's Children Research Hospital protocol. 
      Genotyping was performed using real-time PCR or restriction fragment length 
      polymorphism. MTX levels were measured using a polarization fluorescence assay 
      from Roche. MTX clearance was estimated on the basis of all available MTX levels 
      measured after high-dose MTX treatment during the consolidation phase. RESULTS: 
      Five variants in four genes (MTHFR, ABCB1, ABCC2, and TYMS) were shown to be 
      associated with toxicity, but neither was associated with MTX pharmacokinetic 
      parameters. For instance, during the consolidation phase, a statistically 
      significant association was found between MTHFR rs1801133 variant allele carriers 
      and a decrease in hemoglobin levels [odds ratio (OR)=3.057; 95% confidence 
      interval (CI): 1.217; 7.680]. In addition, a statistically significant 
      association was found among neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count<500) and 
      variant allele carriers of ABCB1 rs1045642 (OR=5.174; 95% CI: 1.674; 15.989) and 
      ABCB1 rs1128503 (OR=3.364; 95% CI: 1.257; 9.004), respectively. ABCC2 rs717620 
      variant allele carriers needed significantly more time to reach a MTX level below 
      0.1 micromol/l (beta=5.122; 95% CI: 1.412; 8.831). During the continuation phase, a 
      statistically significant association was found between ABCC2 rs717620 and TYMS 
      28-bp tandem repeats carriers with the need to decrease weekly MTX doses 
      (beta=-4.905; 95% CI: -9; -0.809 and beta=-5.770; 95% CI: -10.138; -1.403), 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: Genotyping for MTHFR, ABCB1, ABCC2, and TYMS 
      polymorphisms may be useful in identifying patients at risk of increased MTX 
      toxicity and the need for dose optimization before treatment initiation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We studied whether thymidylate synthase (TS) genotype has an 
      independent prognostic/predictive impact on a European population of advanced 
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving pemetrexed. METHODS: 
      Twenty-five patients treated with pemetrexed-based regimens were included. 
      Genomic DNA was isolated prior to treatment. The variable number of tandem repeat 
      (VNTR) polymorphisms, the G > C single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and the TS 
      6-bp insertion/deletion (6/6) in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) polymorphisms 
      were analyzed and correlated with overall response rate (ORR), progression-free 
      survival (PFS), overall-survival (OS) and toxicity. RESULTS: The genotype +6/+6 
      predicted a higher ORR among active/former smokers compared to +6/-6 genotype 
      (100% vs. 50%; p = 0.085). Overall, the 3R/3R genotype predicted a higher ORR 
      (100%) over the rest VNTR polymorphisms (p = 0.055). The presence of 3R/3R 
      genotype significantly correlated with a superior ORR in patients without EGFR 
      activating mutations (100%) compared to 2R/2R, 2R/3R and 3R/4R genotype (77.8%, 
      33.3% and 0% respectively; p = 0.017). After a median follow-up of 21 months, a 
      trend towards a better PFS, although not significant, was found among subjects 
      showing 3R/3R polymorphisms (p = 0.089). A significantly superior OS was found in 
      patients showing 3R/3R genotype rather than other VNTR polymorphisms (p = 0.019). 
      No significant correlation with the toxicity was observed. CONCLUSION: In our 
      series, 3R/3R polymorphism correlated with a superior OS. Also, this 
      polymorphism, when associated to wild type EGFR, was related to a higher ORR to 
      pemetrexed. Toxicity was not significantly correlated with a specific TS 
      genotype.

AB  - This study from South India was performed to ascertain the impact of seven 
      functional polymorphisms of one-carbon metabolic pathway on total plasma 
      homocysteine levels and susceptibility to PD. A total of 151 cases of Parkinson's 
      disease and 416 healthy controls were analyzed for fasting plasma homocysteine 
      levels by reverse phase HPLC. PCR-RFLP approaches were used to analyze glutamate 
      carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) 1561 C>T, reduced folate carrier 1 (RFC1) 80 G>A, 
      cytosolic serine hydroxymethyl transferase (cSHMT) 1420 C>T, methylene 
      tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677 C>T, methionine synthase (MTR) 2756 A>G 
      and methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) 66 A>G polymorphisms. PCR-AFLP was used 
      for the analysis of thymidylate synthase (TYMS) 5'-UTR 28bp tandem repeat. PD 
      cases exhibited elevated plasma homocysteine levels compared to controls (men: 
      28.8 +/- 6.9 vs. 16.4 +/- 8.8 mumol/L; women: 25.4 +/- 5.3 vs. 11.2 +/- 5.1mumol/L). 
      Homocysteine levels showed positive correlation with male gender (r=0.39, 
      p<0.0001) and MTRR 66 A>G (r=0.31, p<0.0001) whereas an inverse correlation was 
      observed with cSHMT 1420 C>T polymorphism. MTRR 66 A>G polymorphism showed 
      independent risk for PD (OR: 3.42, 95% CI: 2.35-4.98) whereas cSHMT 1420 C>T 
      conferred protection against PD (OR: 0.11, 95% CI: 0.07-0.17). Multifactor 
      dimensionality reduction analysis showed synergistic interactions between MTHFR 
      677 C>T and MTRR 66 A>G, whereas cSHMT 1420 C>T exhibited counteracting 
      interactions in altering susceptibility to PD. To conclude, PD cases exhibited 
      hyperhomocysteinemia and MTRR 66 A>G and cSHMT 1420 C>T gene variants were shown 
      to modulate PD risk by altering the homocysteine levels.

      leukemia.
PG  - 1719-23
AB  - The current study was aimed to elucidate the association of thymidylate synthase 
      (TYMS) 5'- UTR 28bp tandem repeat and cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase 
      (cSHMT) C1420T polymorphisms with acute leukemia in South Indian subjects. A 
      total of 812 subjects [523 healthy controls, 148 acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
      (ALL) cases and 141 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases] were screened for TYMS 
      5'-UTR 28bp tandem repeat and cSHMT C1420T using PCR-AFLP and PCR-with 
      confronting two-pair primers (CTPP) approaches. TYMS 5'-UTR 2R allele frequencies 
      of controls, ALL and AML cases were 35.3%, 28.0% and 30.1% respectively. This 
      polymorphism conferred protection against ALL (OR: 0.71, 95%CI: 0.53-0.96) while 
      showing no statistically significant association with AML (OR: 0.79, 95%CI: 0.58, 
      1.07). The cSHMT variant allele (T-) frequencies of ALL and AML cases (6.42% and 
      5.68% respectively) were significantly lower compared to controls (58.3%). This 
      polymorphism conferred protection against ALL (OR: 0.049, 95%CI: 0.029-0.081) and 
      AML (OR: 0.043, 95%CI: 0.025-0.074). The TYMS 5'-UTR 2R2R genotype was associated 
      with a lower total leukocyte count, smaller percentage of blasts, and more 
      adequate platelet count compared to 2R3R and 3R3R genotypes in ALL cases. No such 
      genotype-dependent differences were observed in AML cases. ALL cases carrying the 
      cSHMT C1420T polymorphism showed higher disease free survival compared to those 
      with the wild genotype. To conclude, the TYMS 5'-UTR 28bp tandem repeat reduces 
      risk for ALL while cSHMT C1420T reduces risk for both ALL and AML. Both also 
      influence disease progression in ALL.

LID - 10.4137/CMO.S12701 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The aim of the study was to explore and describe the effect of polymorphisms 
      in folate-associated genes regarding the levels of different folate forms and 
      their distribution in tumors and mucosa in patients with colorectal cancer. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tumor and mucosa tissues from 53 patients with colorectal 
      cancer were analyzed. The concentrations of tetrahydrofolate (THF), 5-methylTHF, 
      and 5,10-methyleneTHF were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. 
      Genotyping of polymorphisms in the folate-associated genes 
      methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR, C677T), methionine synthase (MTR, 
      A2756G), and thymidylate synthase (TS, 5'-TSER 28 bp tandem repeat and 3'-TSUTR 6 
      bp deletion/insertion), were done by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Folate 
      levels and distributions were determined in the total patient cohort and after 
      subgrouping by genotypes. RESULTS: The total folate level, as well as the THF and 
      5,10-methyleneTHF levels, were significantly higher in the tumor compared with 
      mucosa tissue (P = 0.030, 0.031, and 0.015, respectively). The individual 
      variation in folate levels in both tumor and mucosa were larger than the 
      variation found when the patients were subgrouped by the gene polymorphisms. No 
      significant differences in the mean concentration of any folate in the mucosa or 
      tumor tissue were found in relation to the analyzed polymorphisms. The percentage 
      level of 5,10-methyleneTHF in tumors was highest in patients with the MTHFR 677 
      CC genotype, and lowest in patients with the TT genotype (P = 0.033). A 
      significantly lower percentage level of the 5,10-methyleneTHF level was found in 
      tumors of patients with the 5'-TSER 3R/3R genotype (P = 0.0031). CONCLUSION: A 
      significant difference was found between the percentage level of 
      5,10-methyleneTHF in tumor tissues in relation to the MTHFR C677T and 5'-TSER 28 
      bp repeat polymorphisms. However, no differences were found in the actual tissue 
      folate levels, or in their distribution, in relation to the polymorphisms in the 
      MTHFR, MTR, or TS genes. These findings could be of importance for further 
      research in the field by explaining some of the difficulties of obtaining 
      reproducible and uniform results when using a few selected polymorphisms as 
      predictive markers.

      advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with platinum-based 
      chemotherapy.

AB  - Thymidylate synthase (TYMS) has three polymorphisms that may modulate thymidylate 
      synthase (TS) expression levels: (1) 28 base pairs (bp) variable number tandem 
      repeat (VNTR) (rs34743033); (2) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) C>G at the 
      twelfth nucleotide of the second repeat of 3R allele (rs2853542); and (3) 6 bp 
      sequence deletion (1494del6, rs34489327). This study was conducted to evaluate 
      the influence of TYMS polymorphisms on the survival of Portuguese patients with 
      advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing platinum-based 
      chemotherapy. Our results showed no statistically significant differences between 
      VNTR genotypes; although, considering the SNP C>G, homozygotes 3RG presented a 
      better prognostic at 36 months (p=0.004) and overall survival (p=0.003) when 
      compared to 2R3RG patients. Patients with "median/high expression genotypes" 
      demonstrated a better survival at 12 months (p=0.041) when compared to "low 
      expression genotypes". Furthermore, 6 bp- carriers (p=0.006) showed a better 
      survival at 12 months when compared to 6 bp+ homozygotes patients. When analyzing 
      TYMS haplotypes, better survival at 12 months was observed for patients carrying 
      haplotypes with the 6 bp- allele (2R6 bp-; p=0.026 and 3RG6 bp-; p=0.045). This 
      is the first report that evaluates the three major TYMS polymorphisms in the 
      therapeutic outcome of NSCLC in Portugal. According to our results, the TYMS 
      polymorphisms may be useful tools to predict which advanced NSCLC patients could 
      benefit more from platinum-based chemotherapy regimens.

      Han population we discuss the genetic contribution of MAOA-VNTR in 141 TS 
      patients including all their parents in Chinese Han population using transmission 
      disequilibrium test (TDT) design. Our results revealed that no significant 
      association was found in the MAOA gene promoter VNTR polymorphism and TS in 
      Chinese Han population (TDT = 1.515, df = 1, p > 0.05). The negative result may 
      be mainly due to the small sample size, but we don't deny the role of gene coding 
      serotonergic or monoaminergic structures in the etiology of TS.

TI  - Thymidylate synthase polymorphism in sporadic colorectal and gastric cancer in 
      Tunisian population: a predictive role in 5-fluorouracil based chemotherapy 
      treatment.
PG  - 825
LID - 10.1007/s12032-013-0825-z [doi]
AB  - In our study, we investigate the possible association of thymidylate synthase 
      polymorphism, 28 bp tandem repeat in 5'-UTR (transcription enhancer element) with 
      susceptibility of colorectal and gastric cancer in Tunisian population. Because 
      thymidylate synthase provides an effective prediction of chemotherapy treatment 
      based on 5-fluorouracil, our interest in this study was focused on finding an 
      eventual interaction between thymidylate synthase polymorphism and treatment of 
      sporadic colorectal and gastric cancer. Whole blood was collected into EDTA tube, 
      after centrifugation for 15 min, the buffy coat was isolated, and genotyping of 
      TS 5'-UTR polymorphism was carried by polymerase chain reaction method using 
      appropriate primers. Determination of the different genotypes was done directly 
      on the stained agarose gel. Our finding showed that the 5'tandem repeat 
      polymorphism of the thymidylate synthase gene is associated with risk of 
      colorectal cancer; thus, LL (3R/3R) genotype is significantly high in patients 
      with colorectal cancer compared to controls (P = 0.002; OR 2.7; 95 % CI 1.4-5.2). 
      In addition, we found a positive association between SL (2R/3R) genotype in the 
      thymidylate synthase 5'-UTR and gastric cancer risk (P = 0.015; OR 4.46; 95 % CI 
      1.08-19.64). Furthermore, we found a correlation of thymidylate synthase 
      polymorphism with the fluorouracil-based therapy regimes and also with 
      preoperatory radiation in patients with colorectal cancer. Thymidylate synthase 
      is associated with risk of colorectal cancer but not with gastric cancer; 
      however, heterozygous SL (2R/3R) polymorphism is associated with risk of gastric 
      cancer; moreover, the 5' tandem repeat polymorphism of thymidylate synthase gene 
      was an independent predictor of the clinical treatment.

TI  - A possible new mechanism in the pathophysiology of polycystic ovary syndrome 
      (PCOS): the discovery that leukocyte telomere length is strongly associated with 
      PCOS.
PG  - E234-40
LID - 10.1210/jc.2013-3685 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Telomeres are specialized chromatin structures located at the ends of 
      eukaryotic chromosomes, and telomere length plays a clear role in various 
      diseases. However, it is not known whether telomere length is related to 
      polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that leukocyte 
      telomere length (LTL) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of PCOS. 
      DESIGN: We used an established and validated quantitative PCR technique to 
      measure the mean LTL in a large sample of PCOS patients and controls. We used 
      logistic regression and multiple linear regression to analyze the association of 
      PCOS and several related clinical parameters with the age-adjusted ratio of the 
      telomere repeat length to the copy number of a single-copy gene (T/S). RESULTS: 
      Individuals with PCOS (n = 698) exhibited significantly shorter LTLs than the 
      controls (n = 611) after adjusting for age (0.764 +/- 0.016 vs 0.876 +/- 0.023; P = 
      .001; odds ratio = 1.403; 95% confidence interval, 1.150-1.712). The mean 
      telomere length in the leukocytes of PCOS patients was comparable to that of 
      control individuals who were on average 6.16 years older. Individuals having 
      shorter telomere lengths (middle and lowest tertile) had significantly higher 
      disease risk than those having the longest telomere length (highest tertile) 
      (odds ratio = 1.614; 95% confidence interval, 1.262-2.066; P = .0001) after 
      adjusting for age. In addition, a significant correlation between the LTL and the 
      level of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate was observed in controls (r = -0.185; P = 
      .01). CONCLUSION: We provide the first report that LTL is strongly associated 
      with PCOS. This study suggests a new role for LTL in the pathophysiology of PCOS 
      and might have important implications for our understanding of the etiology of 
      the disease.

TI  - Polymorphisms of GSTP1, ERCC2 and TS-3'UTR are associated with the clinical 
      outcome of mFOLFOX6 in colorectal cancer patients.
PG  - 648-654
AB  - The aim of the current study was to examine whether polymorphisms in drug 
      metabolism genes have any clinical impact on patients treated with 5-fluorouracil 
      (FU)/oxaliplatin for metastatic colorectal cancer (MCRC). In total, 63 patients 
      with MCRC were recruited and treated with a modified FOLFOX6 (mFOLFOX6) treatment 
      as a first-line chemotherapy. Polymorphisms in five drug metabolism genes and two 
      DNA-repair genes were assessed in these patients using polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR), a PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique or 
      invader techniques. These included a 28-bp tandem repeat in the 5'-untranslated 
      region (UTR) and 6-bp deletions in the 3'-UTR of thymidylate synthase (TS), 
      methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR; Ala677Val), glutathione S-transferase 
      pi (GSTP1; IIe105Val), GST theta1 (GSTT1; deletion) and GST mu1 (GSTM1; deletion) and 
      the two DNA-repair genes, excision repair cross-complementing-1 (ERCC1; 
      Asp118Asn) and ERCC2 (Lys751Gln). The correlation between these polymorphisms and 
      the clinical outcome, including drug response, progression-free survival (PFS), 
      overall survival (OS) and the incidence of peripheral neuropathy, were evaluated. 
      Patients with the GSTP1-105 A/A genotype had poor responses to mFOLFOX6 treatment 
      compared with those with the GSTP1-105 A/G and G/G genotypes (P=0.01). The median 
      PFS of patients with the ERCC2-751 A/A genotype tended to be longer than that of 
      patients with the ERCC2-751 A/C genotype (P=0.05). Patients with the TS-3'-UTR 
      -6/-6 genotype had a significantly longer OS compared with patients with other 
      genotypes (P=0.003). A statistically significant association between the 
      incidence of peripheral neuropathy higher than grade 2 and the GSTP1-105 (P=0.03) 
      and GSTM1 genotypes (P=0.02) was identified by multivariate logistic regression 
      analyses. Results demonstrated that polymorphisms in GSTP1-105, ERCC2-751 and the 
      3'-UTR of TS may be a statistically significant predictors of clinical outcome. 
      GSTP1-105 and GSTM1 genotypes may be useful markers of severe peripheral 
      neuropathy in MCRC patients treated with 5-FU/oxaliplatin as first-line 
      chemotherapy.

TI  - Thymidylate synthase gene polymorphism and survival of colorectal cancer patients 
      receiving adjuvant 5-fluorouracil.

AB  - Limited studies indicate a possible association of 5'-UTR thymidylate synthase 
      enhancer region polymorphism and treatment outcome in patients medicated with 
      5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The study was designed to verify the relationship in 
      patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), a Polish population that received 
      5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy. The study analyzed 145 Astler-Coller B2 and C 
      CRC patients. Genotyping for a variable number of tandem repeats and G to C 
      single-nucleotide polymorphism in the 5'-UTR of the thymidylate synthase (TS) 
      gene was carried out. TS genotypes were classified into high expression (high TS) 
      and low expression types (low TS). High TS was found in 22.8% of patients. The 
      right-side tumors were more frequently associated with high TS than the left-side 
      tumors (p=0.024). High TS was only found in 9.3% of rectal tumors, but in 29.7% 
      of colon cancers (p=0.0042). Disease-free survival after 20 months (DFS 20) was 
      longer in subjects with low TS than in high TS (p=0.043). Patients who underwent 
      chemotherapy had longer DFS 20 in the low TS than in the high TS subgroup 
      (p=0.051). The low TS was found to be an independent good prognostic factor for 
      DFS 20 in the whole group as well as in the subgroup treated with chemotherapy 
      (p=0.024 and p=0.034, respectively). Patients with low TS did not show any 
      differences in DFS 20 whether they were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy or 
      not. Proximal CRC tumors are characterized by higher TS expression genotypes than 
      distal tumors, and are at significantly greater risk of early recurrence during 
      the first 20 months after surgery.

TI  - Genetic polymorphisms of enzymes related to oral tegafur/uracil therapeutic 
      efficacy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 617-22
LID - 10.1097/CAD.0b013e3283614fef [doi]
AB  - Oral tegafur/uracil therapy has been indicated for patients with hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC) and is often used as a single-agent treatment. However, how the 
      treatment efficacy is related to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) metabolic enzymes is 
      unclear. We investigated genetic polymorphisms of the 5-FU metabolic enzymes in 
      Japanese patients with HCC. We examined two genetic polymorphisms of the 
      metabolic enzymes cytochrome P450 2A6 (CYP2A6) and dihydropyrimidine 
      dehydrogenase (DPD) in 58 Japanese hepatitis C virus-seropositive HCC patients. 
      To measure efficacy, we investigated genetic polymorphisms of the variable number 
      of tandem repeats (VNTRs) of thymidylate synthase (TS) and classified the 
      genotypes as high or low expression types. The frequency of the CYP2A6*4 allele 
      (no-activity allele) among 58 HCC patients was 0.233 and a homozygous genotype 
      (*4/*4) was found in five patients. The heterozygous genotype (T/C) of DPYD*9 
      (T85C) was detected in eight patients and the frequency of the DPYD*9 allele 
      among 58 HCC patients was 0.069. Of 58 patients, 42 were classified as high 
      expression type and 16 as low expression type for TS VNTR. Fifteen of these 16 
      patients appeared to have normal CYP2A6 metabolic activity and 13 of these 15 
      patients likely had normal DPD metabolic activity. Only 13 of 58 HCC patients 
      (22.4%) tested may respond positively to treatment with oral tegafur/uracil. 
      Therefore, when administering oral 5-FU in patients with HCC, it is important to 
      consider three genetic polymorphisms (CYP2A6, DPYD, and TS) associated with 5-FU 
      metabolic enzymes.

TI  - Genetic variability & chemotoxicity of 5-fluorouracil & cisplatin in head & neck 
      cancer patients: a preliminary study.
PG  - 125-9
AB  - background & objectives: The efficacy and toxicity of a given chemotherapy 
      regimen varies widely among patients due to the inherited variability of genes 
      that are involved in drug metabolism. There are several crucial enzymes 
      identified involving metabolism of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin, which are 
      polymorphic. We studied head and neck cancer patients (n=23) on 5-FU and 
      cisplatin combination therapy attending a tertiary care cancer research institute 
      in Gujarat, India, to understand the effect of a particular genotype on toxicity. 
      METHODS: The patients were genotyped for dihydropyrimidine (DPYD) (85T>C, 
      IVS14+1G>A, 2846A>T, 2194G>A), thymidylate synthase (TYMS) [28bp tandem repeat in 
      the promoter enhancer region (TSER)], methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 
      (677C>T, 1298A>C), glutathione S-transferase P1(GSTP1) (Ile105Val), glutathione 
      S-transferase T1 (GSTT1) (null allele) and glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) 
      (null allele) by multiplex allele-specific PCR and long range PCR. RESULTS: Of 
      the 23 (19 males 4 females, age range 18-16 yr) patients, two had grade 3 and 4 
      toxicity while the remaining 21 had 0 to 2 grade toxicity after treatment with 
      5-FU and cisplatin combination therapy. An association between the genotype of 
      GSTM1 (+/- and -/-) and the toxicity of cisplatin (P=0.043) was observed. 
      INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this preliminary study suggested an 
      association between the variants of GSTM1 and toxicity observed due to cisplatin. 
      Well planned studies on a large sample of head and neck cancer patients need to 
      be conducted to understand the effects of these genetic variants on toxicity and 
      efficacy of anticancer drugs.

TI  - Factors predicting the response to oral fluoropyrimidine drugs: a phase II trial 
      on the individualization of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy using oral

      resection (ACT-01 Study).

AB  - We evaluated the predictive relevance of several biomarkers on the survival of 
      patients with stage III colorectal cancer treated with adjuvant chemotherapy of 
      oral fluoropyrimidines. This was a multicenter phase II trial on adult patients 
      with histologically confirmed resected stage III (Dukes' C) colorectal cancer. 
      Patients received oral doxifluridine (800 mg/m2/day) in 3 divided doses, or oral 
      uracil/tegafur (UFT) (400 mg/m2/day) in 2 divided doses for 5 days, every 7 days 
      for 12 months with a 5-year follow-up. Outcome measures were disease-free 
      survival and tissue markers [thymidine phosphorylase (TP), dihydropyrimidine 
      dehydrogenase (DPD) protein levels and TP, DPD, thymidylate synthase (TS) and 
      orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT) mRNA levels in tumor samples and TS 
      tandem-repeat type in blood samples]. There was a significant association between 
      the intratumoral TP/DPD enzyme ratio and disease-free survival when the model 
      included the drug, the parameter and the interactions between them [hazard ratio 
      (HR)=2.76; P=0.00469]. The 5-year disease-free survival rate was statistically 
      significantly higher in patients with high TP/DPD ratios [median >/=2.63: 71.9%; 
      95% confidence interval (CI) 61.4-80.0] compared to patients with low TP/DPD 
      ratios (<2.63: 57.0%; 95% CI 46.3-66.3) (log-rank P=0.0277) following adjuvant 
      therapy with oral fluoropyrimidines. No significant association was observed 
      between the intratumoral TP/DPD enzyme ratio (cut-off value 2.0) and the 
      disease-free survival rate in the doxifluridine group; primary endpoint (log-rank 
      P=0.6850). The magnitude of the intratumoral TP/DPD enzyme ratio may be a 
      potential indicator for the individualization of postoperative adjuvant 
      chemotherapy with oral fluoropyrimidines for stage III colorectal cancer.

TI  - Correlation between thymidylate synthase gene polymorphisms and efficacy of 
      pemetrexed in advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
PG  - 1010-1016
AB  - One of the target genes of pemetrexed (PEM), thymidylate synthase (TS), has been 
      shown to have a close association with its efficacy. TS gene polymorphisms have 
      been shown to be associated with the efficacy of antifolate treatment in enteron 
      tumors. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of 
      TS gene polymorphisms in patients with advanced NSCLC receiving PEM-based 
      treatment. The variable nucleoid tandem repeat in the 5'-UTR region was amplified 
      and detected using fluorescently labeled multiplex short tandem repeat polymerase 
      chain reaction. The polymorphism in the 3'-UTR region of the TS gene was detected 
      using the Taqman probe. Efficacy of PEM was assessed according to the Response 
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1. None of the genotypes were 
      associated with gender, smoking status and age. Disease control rate (DCR), 
      objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) were similar 
      between patients harboring 2R and 3R alleles (PFS, p=0.518; DCR, p=0.631; ORR, 
      p=0.541), as well as those with a 6-bp insertion and 6-bp deletion (PFS, p=0.776; 
      DCR, p=0.626; ORR, p=0.330). To study the combined effect of TS polymorphisms, 
      the study population was divided into three groups: 2R&6 del, 2R&6 ins and 3R&6 
      del. No significant differences were observed among the different groups 
      according to DCR (p=0.517), ORR (p=0.611) and PFS (p=0.938). In conclusion, 
      polymorphisms of the TS gene do not appear to be a prognostic marker for advanced 
      NSCLC patients receiving PEM-based treatment.

TI  - Polymorphic thymidylate synthase gene impacts on overall survival of patients 
      with epithelial ovarian cancer after platinum-based chemotherapy.
PG  - 1609-19
LID - 10.2217/pgs.12.136 [doi]
AB  - AIM: High levels of TS have been associated with a worse clinical outcome in 
      several cancers including epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). The TS gene (TYMS) is 
      highly polymorphic and has an effect on mRNA/protein expression. MATERIALS & 
      METHODS: Six TYMS polymorphisms were investigated for overall survival (OS) in 
      216 EOC patients: TYMS 1494ins/del, TSER (variable number of tandem repeats of 28 
      bp), TSER G>C, TYMS 1053C>T, TYMS IVS6-68C>T and TYMS 1122A>G. RESULTS: In a 
      multivariate analysis, TYMS 1494 del/del genotype was associated with a 
      significant increased OS compared with the ins/ins genotype (hazard ratio: 0.36; 
      95% CI: 0.16-0.82, p = 0.01). Similar results were obtained for the mutant 
      genotypes TYMS 1053TT and TYMS IVS6-68TT. The event-free survival was 
      significantly higher in TYMS 1053TT patients compared with wild-type patients (p 
      = 0.05). CONCLUSION: TYMS 1494ins/del, 1053C>T and IVS6-68C>T polymorphisms can 
      be prognostic markers for OS in patients with EOC, independently from stage at 
      diagnosis, median age and tumor histotype.

TI  - Relationship between antimetabolite toxicity and pharmacogenetics in Turkish 
      cancer patients.
PG  - 1553-6
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Antimetabolites may cause severe toxicity and even toxic death in 
      cancer patients. Our aim was to evaluate the relationship between antimetabolite 
      toxicity and pharmacogenetics in patients with severe clinical toxicity or 
      alanine transaminase (ALT) elevation after fluorouracil (5FU), capecitabine or 
      methotrexate administration. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cancer patients with severe 
      antimetabolite toxicity were evaluated for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 
      (MTHFR) gene C667T, thymidilate synthase (TS) gene 5' UTR variable number of 
      tandem repeats (VNTR), dihydroprymidine dehydrogenase (DPYD) gene IVS14+1G/A, 
      Xeroderma pigmentosum (XPD) gene Lys751Gln and X-ray repair cross-complementing 
      group 1 (XRCC1) gene Arg399Gln polymorphisms. RESULTS: Eighteen patients were 
      enrolled, with a male/female ratio of 0.8. They had osteosarcoma in methotrexate 
      group (n=7), gastrointestinal malignancies in 5FU group (n=9) and breast cancer 
      in the capecitabine group (n=2). Mucositis and dermatitis occurred in all groups, 
      together with ALT elevation in the methotrexate group and 2 toxic deaths were 
      encountered. DPYD, TS, MTHFR, XPD and XRCC1 gene polymorphism rare allele 
      frequencies were observed to be higher than in the general population. 
      CONCLUSION: Pharmacogenetics might contribute to tailored therapy.

TI  - Association of the TYMS 3G/3G genotype with poor response and GGH 354GG genotype 
      with the bone marrow toxicity of the methotrexate in RA patients.
PG  - 377-83
LID - 10.1007/s00228-012-1341-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Gamma-glutamyl hydrolase (GGH), cyclin D1 (CCND1) and thymidylate 
      synthase (TS) genes encode enzymes that are involved in methotrexate (MTX) 
      action. In a group of 184 RA patients treated with MTX, we have investigated 
      whether selected polymorphisms in these genes modulate MTX efficacy and/or have 
      impact on adverse drug effects (ADEs). METHODS: The efficacy of the MTX therapy 
      has been estimated using the disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28-ESR) 
      based on EULAR criteria and relative DAS28 values (rDAS28). All adverse drug 
      events were recorded. Patients were genotyped for selected polymorphisms of the 
      GGH (-354 G > T and 452 C > T), CCND1 (870 A > G) and TYMS (variable number of 
      tandem repeats, VNTR, and G to C substitution of triple repeat, 3R allele) gene. 
      Association studies have been performed between obtained genotypes and the 
      efficacy and toxicity of MTX. RESULTS: According to the EULAR response criteria, 
      146 RA patients (79.3 %) were classified as responders (good/moderate response) 
      and 38 (20.7 %) as non-responders (poor response). Higher frequency of the TYMS 3 
      G/3 G genotype has been found among non-responders as compared to individuals 
      with remaining genotypes (p = 0.02). ADEs were recorded in 53 patients. Among 
      those patients eight experienced bone marrow toxicity, all of them carried GGH 
      -354GG genotype (p = 0.003). No other significant association were observed. 
      CONCLUSION: The 3 G/3 G genotype of the TYMS gene may indicate predisposition of 
      poor response to MTX and GG genotype of GGH -354 T > G polymorphism may have high 
      predictive value for myelosuppression in RA patients.

TI  - Thymidylate synthase enhancer region polymorphism not related to susceptibility 
      to acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the Kashmir population.
PG  - 906-17
LID - 10.4238/2012.April.10.6 [doi]
AB  - Thymidylate synthase (TS) is a crucial enzyme in folate metabolism and plays a 
      vital role in DNA synthesis and repair. The most common polymorphism in TS is a 
      unique double (2R) or triple (3R) 28-bp tandem repeat sequence in the enhancer 
      region of the TS gene (TSER). This genetic variation in TSER has been widely 
      investigated and has been implicated as a risk factor for the development of 
      various cancers, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia. It has also been found 
      to influence sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs, such as methotrexate. We evaluated 
      this polymorphism in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients in the Kashmir 
      population. In order to determine whether a double (2R2R) versus a triple (3R3R) 
      28-bp tandem repeat in the TSER modulates risk for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 
      72 acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases and 144 age and gender matched, unrelated 
      healthy individuals from the Kashmir region of India were evaluated for this 
      polymorphism by PCR and direct sequencing. We found the frequency of the TS 2R 
      allele to be 32.6 and 26.0%, in cases and controls, respectively. The TS 2R/2R 
      genotype was found to be present in 15.27% of the cases and 9.72% of the 
      controls, the 2R/3R variant in 34.72% of the cases and 32.63% of the controls, 
      and the 3R/3R genotype in 50.0% of the cases and 57.63% of the controls. There 
      was a significant association between the TS 2R/2R genotype and gender of acute 
      lymphoblastic leukemia patients with males harboring the 2R/2R genotype 
      exhibiting a higher risk of developing acute lymphoblastic leukemia than females 
      (P = 0.009) We concluded that the TSER polymorphism appears not to be a risk 
      factor for susceptibility to acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the Kashmir 
      population.

TI  - Association of aberrations in one-carbon metabolism with molecular phenotype and 
      grade of breast cancer.
PG  - E32-41
LID - 10.1002/mc.21830 [doi]
AB  - We have earlier demonstrated the role of aberrant one-carbon metabolism in the 
      etiology of breast cancer. In the current study, we examine the clinical utility 
      of these factors in predicting the subtype of breast cancer and as indicators of 
      disease progression. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length 
      polymorphism (RFLP) and PCR-amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) 
      approaches were used for genetic analysis. Plasma folate and homocysteine were 
      measured using Axsym folate kit and reverse phase HPLC, respectively. Multiple 
      linear regression models were used to test the predictability of disease 
      progression. Luminal A subtype was associated with late age of onset, higher body 
      mass index and lack of family history of breast cancer. Thymidylate synthase 
      (TYMS) 5'-UTR 28 bp tandem repeat (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.05-4.16) and methylene 
      tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T (OR: 4.10, 95% CI: 1.40-11.95) were 
      strongly associated with Luminal B. Reduced folate carrier (RFC1) G80A (OR: 2.92, 
      95% CI: 1.22-6.97) and methionine synthase (MTR) A2756G (OR: 4.71, 95% CI: 
      1.66-13.31) polymorphisms were associated with LuminA-HH subtype while MTHFR 
      C677T showed association with HER-enriched (OR: 30.41, 95% CI: 6.47-142.91). 
      Cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase (cSHMT) conferred protection against 
      basal-like breast cancer (OR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.22-0.98). HER-enriched and 
      basal-like subtypes showed positive association with familial breast cancer and 
      inverse association with plasma folate. Hyperhomocysteinemia was observed in 
      Luminal B and basal-like subtypes. Multiple linear regression models of aberrant 
      one-carbon metabolism were found to be moderate predictors of breast cancer grade 
      (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, C = 0.72, 95% CI: 
      0.58-0.87, P = 0.008). To conclude, aberrations in one-carbon metabolism predict 
      the subtype of breast cancer and disease progression.

AB  - The impact of thymidylate synthase (TYMS), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 
      (MTHFR), and serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 (SHMT1) gene polymorphisms and 
      that of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) enzyme activity, serum total

      5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and bevacizumab (FOLFIRI+bevacizumab) 
      regimen efficacy in metastatic colorectal cancer patients was investigated. DNA 
      was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Genotyping was performed 
      for TYMS 5'UTR variable number tandem repeat, TYMS 3'UTR ins/del, MTHFR C677T, 
      and SHMT1 C1420T polymorphisms. The DPD activity of peripheral blood mononuclear 
      cells was also determined. The univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated 
      that the SHMT1 1420T allele was associated with better response (P=0.025) and 
      longer progression-free survival (PFS) (P=0.00004) and overall survival (OS) 
      (P=0.034). Grade >/=2 hypertension was also an independent prognostic factor of 
      longer progression-free survival and OS. Bevacizumab-related hypertension might 
      be a predictive marker of treatment efficacy (P=0.0002 for OS) in the case of 
      wild (CC) SHMT1 1420 genotypes only.

TI  - TS gene polymorphisms are not good markers of response to 5-FU therapy in stage 
      III colon cancer patients.
PG  - 327-35
LID - 10.1007/s13402-011-0030-z [doi]
AB  - AIM: Although the predictive and prognostic value of thymidylate synthase (TS) 
      expression and gene polymorphism in colon cancer has been widely studied, the 
      results are inconclusive probably because of methodological differences. With 
      this study, we aimed to elucidate the role of TS gene polymorphisms genotyping in 
      therapy response in stage III colon carcinoma patients treated with 5-FU adjuvant 
      chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 251 patients diagnosed with stage III colon 
      carcinoma treated with surgery followed by 5-FU based adjuvant therapy were 
      selected. The variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) and the single nucleotide 
      polymorphism (SNP) in the 5'untranslated region of the TS gene were genotyped. 
      RESULTS: There was a positive association between tumor T stage and the VNTR 
      genotypes (p = 0.05). In both univariate and multivariate survival analysis no 
      effects of the studied polymorphisms on survival were found. However, there was 
      an association between both polymorphisms and age. Among patients younger than 60 
      years, the patients homozygous for 2R seemed to have a better overall survival, 
      whereas among the patients older than 67 this longer survival was seen by the 
      carriers of other genotypes. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the TS VNTR and SNP do 
      not predict response to 5-FU therapy in patients with stage III colon carcinoma. 
      However, age appears to modify the effects of TS polymorphisms on survival.

TI  - Use of a comprehensive panel of biomarkers to predict response to a 
      fluorouracil-oxaliplatin regimen in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
PG  - 433-42
LID - 10.2217/pgs.10.196 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Polymorphisms in the metabolism, detoxification or DNA repair pathways have 
      been proposed as potential predictors of response to 5-fluorouracil and 
      oxaliplatin. We have studied the predictive value of a set of germline genetic 
      polymorphisms in metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with mFolfox-6. 
      MATERIALS & METHODS: A total of 72 patients, comprising 50 men (69.4%) and 22 
      women (30.6%), were included after the signing of an informed consent form. 
      Median age was 65.5 years (range: 32-80). All participants received mFolfox-6. 
      DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples and genotyped by direct 
      sequencing, SnapShot((R)) and multiplex PCR techniques. Eight polymorphisms within 
      six genes were investigated: TS 5 -UTR (variable number tandem repeat + G/C), TS 
      3 -UTR (TS1494del6); MTHFR C677T and A1298C; GSTP1 I105V; ERCC1 C118T; XPD 
      Lys751Gln and XRCC1 Arg399Gln. Association was evaluated by univariate analysis, 
      and Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier assessed survival. The local ethics committee 
      approved the pharmacogenetic study protocol and all subjects signed an informed 
      consent before participating in the study. RESULTS: The sample was in 
      Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Only XPD Lys751Gln was found to be significantly 
      associated with a favorable progression-free survival (PFS). Median PFS for XPD 
      Lys751Gln patients (n = 33) was 16 months (95% CI: 9.2-22.7), 10 months (95% CI: 
      6.1-13.9) for Gln/Gln (n = 11) and 8 months (95% CI: 5.8-10.2) for Lys/Lys (n = 
      28), p = 0.019. The increased risk of progression was: 1.93 (95% CI: 1.13-13.30; 
      p = 0.017) for Lys/Lys and 2.1 (95% CI: 1.01-4.22; p = 0.047) for Gln/Gln. 
      Patients with one or two Val alleles of GSTP1 tended to a lower risk of 
      progression compared with Ile/Ile homozygotes, p = 0.067. When XPD Lys751Gln and 
      GSTP1 were analyzed jointly, patients who carried one or two favorable genotypes, 
      XPD Lys751Gln and Val, had a longer median PFS: 11 months (95% CI: 7.4-14.6) 
      compared with six (95% CI: 4.6-7.4) with unfavorable genotypes, p < 0.001. 
      CONCLUSION: In metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with mFolfox-6, the 
      combination of haplotype XPD Lys751Gln-GSTP1 105Val seems to predict the risk of 
      progression.

TI  - Thymidylate synthase gene polymorphisms and markers of DNA methylation capacity.
PG  - 481-7
LID - 10.1016/j.ymgme.2010.12.015 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: DNA methylation plays a critical role in gene regulation and has been 
      implicated in the etiology of chronic disease including atherosclerosis, neural 
      degeneration and cancer. One-carbon metabolism serves two critically important 
      functions: one concerning the production of purines and thymidine for DNA 
      synthesis and the other related to the provision of methyl groups through the 
      metabolism of methionine. Critical intermediates of methionine metabolism 
      relevant to DNA methylation include S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a universal 
      methyl donor, and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), a potent inhibitor of most 
      methylation reactions. Thymidine synthesis, catalyzed by the crucial enzyme 
      thymidylate synthase (TS), competes with methionine metabolism for a common 
      substrate. Three functional polymorphisms in the TS gene have been identified 
      including: (i) the thymidylate synthase enhancer region (TSER) tandem repeat 
      polymorphism and (ii) the G to C single nucleotide polymorphism (G/C SNP) both of 
      which occur in the 5'untranslated region (UTR) of the TS gene; and (iii) the 6-bp 
      deletion at base pair 1494 (TS1494del6) located in the 3'UTR. PURPOSE: The 
      purpose of this research was to investigate the relationship between TS 
      polymorphisms and concentrations of SAM and SAH, markers of DNA methylation 
      capacity. METHODS: The study population consisted of 395 healthy male and female 
      volunteers from Kingston, Ontario and Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada between 2006 
      and 2008. The effect of each TS polymorphism on SAM and SAH concentrations was 
      investigated, and further analyses were conducted on categorization of 
      polymorphisms based on 5' or 3'UTR. The combined effect of TS polymorphisms on 
      SAM and SAH concentrations was also investigated, in addition to interactions 
      between polymorphisms in TS and MTHFR 677C>T and interactions between TS 
      polymorphisms and serum folate and vitamin B(12) status. RESULTS: No associations 
      were observed between TS polymorphisms and concentrations of SAM and SAH. 
      Analysis of interaction between TS and MTHFR polymorphisms on SAH levels revealed 
      a significant interaction with TS 3'polymorphism and MTHFR C677T (p=0.03). As 
      well, interactions between TS 3'polymorphism and serum folate (p=0.03) and the 
      combined effect of TS polymorphisms and serum folate on SAH levels (p=0.04) were 
      found. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this research provide evidence that SAH, a 
      marker of methylation capacity, is influenced by genetic and environmental 
      factors and their interactions.

TI  - TS gene tandem repeats in esophageal cancer patients receiving chemoradiotherapy.
PG  - 1036-43
AB  - 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) interferes with tumor-cell proliferation by inhibiting 
      thymidylate synthase (TS). We examined the relationship between tandem repeat 
      (TR) variations in the TS gene and survival following concurrent 
      chemoradiotherapy in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). 
      TS-TR variations were analyzed in 57 stage II-IV ESCC patients undergoing 
      chemoradiotherapy combined with 5-FU and cisplatinum (CDDP), and in 106 controls. 
      Pretreatment non-neoplastic biopsy specimens from ESCC patients and lymphocytes 
      from controls were used for analysis. Variations were identified by the size of 
      DNA fragments amplified by polymerase chain reaction. Two to five TRs were found 
      in Japanese individuals. TR3 homozygotes were predominant in 74% of ESCC patients 
      and 61% of controls. Three-year survival rates were significantly longer in 
      patients with TR2/2 or TR2/3 genotypes (38%) than in patients with TR3/3, 3/4, or 
      3/5 genotypes (9%; p=0.011). In the Cox proportional hazard model, the TR2/2 or 
      TR2/3 genotypes were the only independent predictor for survival (Hazard ratio, 
      2.647; 95% confidence interval, 1.271-5.513). The TS-TR variations exert an 
      important influence on survival following chemoradiotherapy in ESCC patients.

TI  - Primary motor cortex alterations in a compound heterozygous form of 
      Unverricht-Lundborg disease (EPM1).
PG  - 65-71
LID - 10.1016/j.seizure.2010.10.010 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Unverricht-Lundborg disease (EPM1) is the most common form of 
      progressive myoclonus epilepsies. The genetic background is a homozygous 
      dodecamer repeat extension mutation in the cystatin B (CSTB) gene. However, 
      mutations occurring in a compound heterozygous form with the expansion mutation 
      have also been reported. In Finland, we have found five EPM1 patients compound 
      heterozygous for the dodecamer repeat expansion and the c.202C>T mutation in the 
      CSTB gene (chEPM1). There are no previous clinical or neurophysiological studies 
      on these patients. Thus, we aimed to characterize possible functional alterations 
      in primary motor cortical areas. METHODS: Five chEPM1 patients were compared with 
      homozygous patients and healthy controls. All patients underwent a clinical 
      evaluation to characterize the severity of the symptoms. Navigated transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to study cortical excitability by determining 
      the motor thresholds (MT), silent periods (SP) and motor evoked potential (MEP) 
      characteristics. Continuous electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded during the 
      measurements. Voxel-based MRI morphometry (VBM) was used to study differences in 
      gray matter volume. RESULTS: The chEPM1 patients exhibited an inhibitory cortical 
      tonus reflected as elevated MTs and prolonged SPs. EEG showed spontaneous focal 
      epileptiform activity in centro-temporal and parietal areas in addition to more 
      widespread and generalized discharges. VBM revealed loss of gray matter volume in 
      primary motor cortical areas and thalami. DISCUSSION: The chEPM1 patients 
      exhibited functional and structural changes in primary motor cortical areas. The 
      functional changes are more profound as compared to homozygous patients, 
      suggesting a neurophysiological background for the more severe clinical symptoms.

TI  - TS gene polymorphisms are not good markers of response to 5-FU therapy in stage 
      III colon cancer patients.
PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.3233/ACP-CLO-2010-0526 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Although the predictive and prognostic value of thymidylate synthase (TS) 
      expression and gene polymorphism in colon cancer has been widely studied, the 
      results are inconclusive probably because of methodological differences. With 
      this study, we aimed to elucidate the role of TS gene polymorphisms genotyping in 
      therapy response in stage III colon carcinoma patients treated with 5-FU adjuvant 
      chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 251 patients diagnosed with stage III colon 
      carcinoma treated with surgery followed by 5-FU based adjuvant therapy were 
      selected. The variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) and the single nucleotide 
      polymorphism (SNP) in the 5'-untranslated region of the TS gene were genotyped. 
      RESULTS: There was a positive association between tumor T stage and the VNTR 
      genotypes (p=0.05).In both univariate and multivariate survival analysis no 
      effects of the studied polymorphisms on survival were found. However, there was 
      an association between both polymorphisms and age. Among patients younger than 60 
      years, the patients homozygous for 2R seemed to have a better overall survival, 
      whereas among the patients older than 67 this longer survival was seen by the 
      carriers of other genotypes. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the TS VNTR and SNP do 
      not predict response to 5-FU therapy in patients with stage III colon carcinoma. 
      However, age appears to modify the effects of TS polymorphisms on survival.

TI  - Interactions of 5'-UTR thymidylate synthase polymorphism with 677C --> T methylene 
      tetrahydrofolate reductase and 66A --> G methyltetrahydrofolate homocysteine 
      methyl-transferase reductase polymorphisms determine susceptibility to coronary 
      artery disease.
PG  - 56-64
AB  - AIM: The current study aimed to address the inconsistencies in association 
      studies, specifically with reference to methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase 
      (MTHFR) C677T polymorphism in the light of gene-gene and gene-nutrient 
      interactions. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted to analyze four genetic 
      polymorphisms i.e. thymidylate synthase (TYMS) 5'-UTR 28 bp tandem repeat, MTHFR 
      C677T, methyltetrahydrofolate homocysteine methyltransferase (MTR) A2756G, 
      methyltetrahydrofolate homocysteine methyltransferase reductase (MTRR) A66G using 
      PCR-AFLP and PCR-RFLP methods; plasma folate and B12 using AxSYM kits; plasma 
      homocysteine by reverse phase HPLC and nitric oxide using Griess reaction. 
      Fisher's exact test, logistic regression analysis and multifactor dimensionality 
      reduction analysis were used for statistical analysis of genetic parameters. 
      Student's t-test was used for biochemical parameters. RESULTS: MTHFR C677T and 
      MTRR A66G were found to increase the risk for CAD by 1.61-fold (95% CI: 
      1.04-2.50) and 1.92-fold (95% CI: 1.29-2.87) whereas TYMS 2R allele was found to 
      reduce the risk for CAD (OR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.49-0.88) by counteracting MTHFR and 
      MTRR variant alleles. Significant gene-gene interactions were observed among 
      TYMS/MTRR (P < 0.0001), MTR/TYMS/MTRR (P < 0.0001), and MTHFR/MTR/TYMS/MTRR (P < 
      0.0001). MTHFR was found to increase the risk (OR: 2.36, 95% CI: 1.28-4.37) only 
      in the absence of the TYMS 2R allele, with marked impairment of the remethylation 
      process (P = 0.007). This impairment was predominant when the dietary folate was 
      in the lowest tertile. In subjects with dietary folate intake in the highest 
      tertile, no such impairment was observed. CONCLUSION: Dietary folate status and 
      TYMS 5'-UTR 28bp tandem repeat polymorphism are important effect modifiers of CAD 
      risk associated with genetic variants in remethylating genes.

TI  - Thymidylate synthase gene polymorphism affects the response to preoperative 
      5-fluorouracil chemoradiation therapy in patients with rectal cancer.
PG  - 669-76
LID - 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2010.06.049 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aims to correlate thymidylate synthase (TS) gene 
      polymorphisms with the tumor response to preoperative 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based 
      chemoradiation therapy (CRT) in patients with rectal cancer. METHODS AND 
      MATERIALS: Forty-four patients with rectal cancer treated with 5-FU-based 
      preoperative CRT were prospectively enrolled in this study. Thymidylate synthase 
      expression and TS gene polymorphisms were evaluated in tumor obtained before 
      preoperative CRT and were correlated with the pathologic response, as assessed by 
      histopathologic staging (pTNM) and tumor regression grade. RESULTS: Patients 
      exhibited 2R/3R and 3R/3R tandem repeat polymorphisms in the TS gene. With regard 
      to TS expression in these genotypes, 2R/3RC and 3RC/3RC were defined as the 
      low-expression group and 2R/3RG, 3RC/3RG, and 3RG/3RG as the high-expression 
      group. There was no significant correlation between TS expression and tumor 
      response. There was no significant difference in the tumor response between 
      patients homozygous for 3R/3R and patients heterozygous for 2R/3R. However, 13 of 
      14 patients in the low-expression group with a G>C single-nucleotide polymorphism 
      (SNP) (2R/3RC [n = 5] or 3RC/3RC [n = 9]) exhibited a significantly greater tumor 
      downstaging rate, as compared with only 12 of 30 patients in the high-expression 
      group without the SNP (2R/3RG [n = 10], 3RC/3RG [n = 9], or 3RG/3RG [n = 11]) (p 
      = 0.001). The nodal downstaging rate was also significantly greater in this 
      low-expression group, as compared with the high-expression group (12 of 14 vs. 14 
      of 30, p = 0.014). However, there was no significant difference in the tumor 
      regression grade between these groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that SNPs 
      within the TS enhancer region affect the tumor response to preoperative 
      5-FU-based CRT in rectal cancer.

TI  - Dyssynchronous systolic expansion of carotid artery in patients with marfan 
      syndrome.
PG  - 1310-6
LID - 10.1016/j.echo.2010.08.022 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Marfan syndrome is a multisystemic connective tissue disorder 
      associated with a mutation affecting fibrillin-1, the main component of 
      microfibrils. Fibrillin-1 gene mutations may affect the carotid arterial wall. 
      The aim of this study was to investigate carotid arterial mechanics using 
      Velocity Vector Imaging (VVI) in patients with Marfan syndrome. METHODS: 
      Forty-five patients (26 men; mean age, 39 +/- 10 years) with Marfan syndrome who 
      fulfilled the Ghent criteria and 45 gender-matched and age-matched healthy 
      volunteers were evaluated. Transverse images of right common carotid artery 
      proximal to the bifurcation were obtained for each subject and divided into six 
      segments. The peak radial velocity, circumferential strain, and strain rate of 
      the six segments were analyzed using VVI. The time to peak radial velocity 
      (T(s)), peak circumferential strain (T(st)), and peak strain rate (T(sr)) of the 
      six segments were calculated. Intima-media thickness was measured for each 
      subject. RESULTS: The average diameter of the common carotid artery in patients 
      with Marfan syndrome was significantly larger than that of controls. Carotid 
      compliance coefficients and distensibility coefficients as assessed by B-mode 
      echocardiographic images were comparable between the two groups. In VVI analyses, 
      averages and standard deviations of peak radial velocities, circumferential 
      strain, and strain rates were not significantly different between the two groups. 
      However, T(s), T(st), and T(sr) were more delayed (P < .01), and the standard 
      deviations of T(s), T(st), and T(sr) were significantly larger in patients with 
      Marfan syndrome (P = .01, P < .01, and P < .01, respectively), suggesting delayed 
      and dyssynchronous arterial expansion during systole. The presence of Marfan 
      syndrome was independently and significantly related to increased standard 
      deviations of T(st) (beta = 0.33, P < .01) and T(sr) (beta = 0.44, P < .01), even after 
      adjusting for age in multiple regression analysis. CONCLUSION: In patients with 
      Marfan syndrome, carotid arteries assessed with VVI exhibited delayed, 
      dyssynchronous arterial expansion during systole compared with healthy controls. 
      Arterial assessment using VVI may be useful for noninvasively quantifying 
      vascular alterations associated with Marfan syndrome.

TI  - Xenobiotic and folate pathway gene polymorphisms and risk of childhood acute 
      lymphoblastic leukaemia in Javanese children.
PG  - 116-23

AB  - Xenobiotic and folate metabolic pathways are important for the maintenance of 
      genetic stability and may influence susceptibility to the development of 
      childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). In this study, we investigated 10 
      polymorphisms in 6 genes (GSTM1-present/null, GSTT1-present/null, GSTP1 1578A > 
      G, NQO1 609C > T, MTHFR 677C > T, MTHFR 1298A > C, MTHFD1 1958G > A, 3'-TYMS 1494 
      6bp-deletion/insertion, 5'-TYMS 28bp-tandem repeats, and SLC19A1 80G > A) in a 
      cohort of 185 Javanese children with ALL and 177 healthy controls. In ALL 
      patients, none of the polymorphisms demonstrated a statistically significant 
      association with ALL after correcting for multiple comparisons. Gender-stratified 
      analysis showed that in girls, GSTT1-null genotype was associated with increased 
      ALL risk (OR = 2.20; p = 0.027), while GSTP1 1578AG genotype was associated with 
      reduced risk (OR = 0.43; p = 0.031). Strong linkage disequilibrium between the 
      MTHFR 677C > T and 1298A > C polymorphisms was observed (D' = 1.0; r(2) = 0.072). 
      The haplotypes 677C-1298C and 677T-1298A were associated with a reduced risk of 
      ALL (OR = 0.68 and 0.64, respectively; gender-adjusted global p = 0.028). 
      Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was employed to identify 
      potential high-order gene-gene interactions and cluster subjects into 
      susceptibility groups. SLC19A1 80G > A emerged as the predominant polymorphism 
      associated with risk of ALL. Individuals simultaneously carrying MTHFR 1298AA, 
      3'-TYMS 6bp deletion(s) and SLC19A1 80A-allele(s) were at higher disease risk (OR 
      = 2.21; p < 0.001). On the contrary, simultaneous possession of MTHFR 1298CC, 
      3'-TYMS 6bp homozygosity and SLC19A1 80A-allele(s) conferred lower risk (OR = 
      0.25; p = 0.004). Carriage of NQO1 609C-allele amongst SLC19A1 80GG genotype was 
      associated with lower risk (OR = 0.47; p = 0.003). In conclusion, our study has 
      demonstrated the importance of gender and gene-gene interaction within the 
      xenobiotic and folate pathways in modulating childhood ALL susceptibility.

TI  - Polymorphisms of thymidylate synthase gene 5'- and 3'-untranslated region and 
      risk of gastric cancer in Koreans.
PG  - 2325-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thymidylate synthase (TS) plays an important role in the conversion 
      of dUMP to dTMP. Polymorphisms of the TS gene affect the expression of the gene, 
      which in turn may result in differences in the outcome of cancer chemotherapy and 
      the progression of gastric cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: These types of TS 
      polymorphism were investigated in 318 gastric cancer patients and 280 controls. A 
      variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR; 2R or 3R) in the thymidylate synthase 
      enhancer region (TSER), a G/C single nucleotide polymorphism within the second 
      repeat sequence of 3R (3G or 3C), and a 6 bp insertion/deletion polymorphism (6 
      bp or 0 bp) in the TS 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) were determined using a 
      polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) 
      method. Patients were sub-grouped by the Lauren classification. RESULTS: The TSER 
      2R/2R genotype had a high odds ratio in gastric cancer and for the intestinal 
      type, but was not statistically significant (adjusted odds ratio, AOR=2.31, 95% 
      confidence interval, CI=0.94-5.65; and AOR=2.53, 95% CI=0.98-6.54, respectively). 
      Among the combined genotypes of TSER VNTR-3'-UTR 6 bp ins/del, 2R2R-6 bp/6 bp 
      having 4 risk alleles conferred a significantly high risk of gastric cancer, 
      particularly of the intestinal type (AOR=8.70, 95% CI=1.09-68.93; and AOR=10.86, 
      95% CI=1.32-89.09, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the 
      2R/2R-6 bp/6 bp combined genotype may be related to high gastric cancer 
      susceptibility.

TI  - Tongue force analysis assesses motor phenotype in premanifest and symptomatic 
      Huntington's disease.
PG  - 2195-202
LID - 10.1002/mds.23243 [doi]
AB  - Motor symptoms in Huntington's Disease (HD) are commonly assessed by the Unified 
      Huntington's Disease Rating Scale-Total Motor Score (UHDRS-TMS). However, the 
      UHDRS-TMS is limited by interrater variability, its categorical nature, and 
      insensitivity in premanifest subjects. More objective and quantitative measures 
      of motor phenotype may complement the use of the UHDRS-TMS as outcome measure and 
      increase the power and sensitivity of clinical trials. Deficits in tongue 
      protrusion are well acknowledged in HD and constitute a subitem of the UHDRS-TMS. 
      We, therefore, investigated whether objective and quantitative assessment of 
      tongue protrusion forces (TPF) provides measures that (1) correlate to the 
      severity of motor phenotype detected in the UHDRS-TMS in symptomatic HD, (2) 
      detect a motor phenotype in premanifest HD gene-carriers, and (3) exhibit a 
      correlation to the genotype as assessed by a disease burden score (based on 
      CAG-repeat length and age). Using a precalibrated force transducer, the ability 
      of premanifest gene carriers (n = 15) and subjects with symptomatic HD (n = 20) 
      to generate and maintain isometric TPF at three target force levels (0.25, 0.5, 
      and 1.0 N) was assessed and compared with age-matched controls (n = 20) in a 
      cross-sectional study. Measures of variability of TPF and tongue contact time 
      distinguished controls, premanifest, and symptomatic HD groups and correlated to 
      the UHDRS-TMS and disease burden score, suggesting a strong genotype-phenotype 
      correlation. Group distinction was most reliable at the lowest target force 
      level. We conclude that assessment of TPF may be a useful objective and 
      quantitative marker of motor dysfunction in premanifest and symptomatic HD.

TI  - Large inverted repeats within Xp11.2 are present at the breakpoints of 
      isodicentric X chromosomes in Turner syndrome.
PG  - 3383-93
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddq250 [doi]
AB  - Turner syndrome (TS) results from whole or partial monosomy X and is mediated by 
      haploinsufficiency of genes that normally escape X-inactivation. Although a 45,X 
      karyotype is observed in half of all TS cases, the most frequent variant TS 
      karyotype includes the isodicentric X chromosome alone [46,X,idic(X)(p11)] or as 
      a mosaic [46,X,idic(X)(p11)/45,X]. Given the mechanism of idic(X)(p11) 
      rearrangement is poorly understood and breakpoint sequence information is 
      unknown, this study sought to investigate the molecular mechanism of idic(X)(p11) 
      formation by determining their precise breakpoint intervals. Karyotype analysis 
      and fluorescence in situ hybridization mapping of eight idic(X)(p11) cell lines 
      and three unbalanced Xp11.2 translocation lines identified the majority of 
      breakpoints within a 5 Mb region, from approximately 53 to 58 Mb, in 
      Xp11.1-p11.22, clustering into four regions. To further refine the breakpoints, a 
      high-resolution oligonucleotide microarray (average of approximately 350 bp) was 
      designed and array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was performed 
      on all 11 idic(X)(p11) and Xp11.2 translocation lines. aCGH analyses identified 
      all breakpoint regions, including an idic(X)(p11) line with two potential 
      breakpoints, one breakpoint shared between two idic(X)(p11) lines and two Xp 
      translocations that shared breakpoints with idic(X)(p11) lines. Four of the 
      breakpoint regions included large inverted repeats composed of repetitive gene 
      clusters and segmental duplications, which corresponded to regions of copy-number 
      variation. These data indicate that the rearrangement sites on Xp11.2 that lead 
      to isodicentric chromosome formation and translocations are probably not random 
      and suggest that the complex repetitive architecture of this region predisposes 
      it to rearrangements, some of which are recurrent.

TI  - Association of thymidylate synthase enhancer region polymorphisms with 
      thymidylate synthase activity in vivo.
PG  - 307-14
LID - 10.1038/tpj.2010.43 [doi]
AB  - Two known polymorphisms in the 5' enhancer region (ER) of the thymidylate 
      synthase (TS) gene, a variable number of tandem repeats of a 28 bp sequence 
      (2R/3R) and a further G>C single nucleotide substitution within the repeats, 
      result in genotypes with 0-5 functional upstream stimulatory factor (USF) E-box 
      consensus elements. However, the relationship between these polymorphisms, 
      regulation of TS expression and patient response to fluoropyrimidine treatment 
      has been inconsistent. In this study, seven possible TSER allele configurations 
      showed similar patterns of luciferase gene expression regardless of cell type or 
      USF-1 content, with no significant difference in promoter activity between the 
      wild-type 2RGC and 3RGGC (1.40+/-0.37 vs 1.43+/-0.32, P=0.90), whereas the minor 
      alleles, 2RCC and 3RGCC, were significantly reduced (0.84+/-0.17, P=0.01) and 
      increased (3.19+/-0.72, P=0.001) respectively. Patient plasma levels of 
      2'-deoxyuridine, a surrogate marker of TS activity, were significantly different 
      between genotypes (P<0.001) and inversely related to luciferase activity (P=0.02) 
      but not to the absolute number of functional repeated elements (P=0.16), 
      suggesting that the position, rather than the number of functional USF E-box 
      repeats in the TSER, is responsible for determining gene expression in vitro and 
      TS activity in vivo.

TI  - Influence of thymidylate synthase DNA polymorphisms and gender on the clinical 
      evolution of patients with advanced colorectal cancer.
PG  - 1393-400
AB  - Experimental evidence has revealed that several thymidylate synthase (TS) DNA 
      polymorphisms modulate gene expression, which, in turn is known to be 
      down-regulated by oestrogen receptor subtypes. Consequently, this process might 
      be influenced by female hormones. Based on these data, we investigated whether 
      patient's gender and TS polymorphism exert an interactive effect on the clinical 
      evolution of patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) subjected to 5 
      fluorouracil (5FU)-based adjuvant chemotherapy. A retrospective study was carried 
      out on paraffin-embedded sections from 81 CRC patients. A variable tandem repeat 
      (VNTR) of 28 bp, a G/C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and a deletion of 6 
      bp (ins1494del 6 bp) were studied. Genotyping methods were polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR) for VNTR, and PCR followed by restriction length fragment 
      polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) for SNP and ins1494del 6 bp. The effect of TS genotype 
      and gender on overall and progression-free survival was assessed in univariate 
      and multivariate (Cox regression model) tests. In male patients, the study of 
      combined TS genotypes showed that G&6+/6+ was an adverse marker for overall 
      (P=0.04; median: not reached) and progression-free survival (P=0.03; median: 12 
      months, 95% CI: 0-32.4). In the multivariate analysis, the concurrence of G&6+/6+ 
      combination and male patients resulted in a 5.5-fold increased risk of relapse or 
      disease progression (95% CI: 1-32.1; likelihood test P=0.004; interaction 
      P=0.06). TS genotype did not affect survival among women. The present study 
      supports that the effect of TS polymorphisms on the clinical evolution of 
      advanced CRC patients is significantly influenced by gender.

TI  - A significant expansion of CD8+ CD28- T-suppressor cells in adult-to-adult living 
      donor liver transplant recipients.
PG  - 4229-31
LID - 10.1016/j.transproceed.2009.09.072 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The appearance of human regulatory CD8(+) CD28(-) T-suppressor (Ts) 
      cells has been associated with a reduced need for maintenance immunosuppression 
      in cadaveric heart- kidney transplant recipients and pediatric liver-intestine 
      transplant recipients. However, few data are available in adult-to-adult living 
      donor liver transplantation (A-A LDLT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: To study the 
      population of CD8(+) CD28(-) Ts cells in A-A LDLT, we performed flow cytometry on 
      whole blood specimens obtained from 20 transplant recipients, 18 end-stage liver 
      disease patients, and 20 normal controls. Meanwhile, we measured the trough 
      levels of immunosuppressants and monitored graft function in transplant 
      recipients. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of the 20 recipients. 
      RESULTS: A significant expansion of CD8(+) CD28(-) Ts cells was observed among 
      recipients of A-A LDLT as compared with a disease control group (P = .000) or 
      healthy individuals (P = .000). All recipients were free of acute cellular 
      rejection episodes. During the follow-up period, no grafts were lost due to acute 
      or chronic rejection. CONCLUSION: Expansion of CD8(+) CD28(-) Ts cells in A-A 
      LDLT seemed to be associated with a decreased occurrence of acute or chronic 
      rejection and sustained good graft function. Based on our low dosages of 
      immunosuppressants for recipients of A-A LDLT, we suggest that this strategy may 
      promote expansion of CD8(+) CD28(-) Ts cells, which can conversely maintain the 
      low immunosuppressant dosages.

TI  - Molecular analysis of the polymorphisms of thymidylate synthase on cell-free 
      circulating DNA in blood of patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma.
PG  - 881-8
LID - 10.1002/ijc.25096 [doi]
AB  - As a key enzyme in folate metabolism, the thymidylate synthase (TS) is important 
      for the synthesis of nucleotides. Its polymorphisms may affect the TS gene 
      expression and the susceptibility for Fluoropyrimidine (FU)-based chemotherapies. 
      In this study, we assessed the relationship between the TS genotypes and clinical 
      outcome to 5-FU-based chemotherapy, and examined whether cell-free circulating 
      DNA is applicable for these molecular analyses. We combined the variable number 
      tandem repeat (VNTR) and single nucleotide (SNP) polymorphisms of the TS promoter 
      and the deletion variants (1494del6) in the 3'UTR with the occurrence of loss of 
      heterozygosity (LOH) at the microsatellite markers D18S59, D18S1140, and D18S976 
      mapped up- and downstream to the TS locus. Cell-free blood DNA, tumor tissues, 
      and leukocytes of 51 patients with advanced colorectal cancer were used. 
      Genotyping revealed linkage disequilibrium between TS promoter and 3'UTR (p = 
      0.03) in blood and leukocytes. Inverse associations of the response to therapy 
      with the number of polymorphisms (p = 0.05) and the 494del6 polymorphism (p < 
      0.02) were detected on serum DNA. The quantification of serum DNA showed 
      significant correlations with the 1494del6 variant (p = 0.006) in tumor tissues 
      and the combined polymorphisms in leukocytes (p < 0.04). In contrast to the low 
      LOH frequency in blood, LOH spanned more than one marker in the primary tumor of 
      the majority of the patients suggesting the loss of the entire TS locus. Our data 
      provide insight into the molecular diversity of the regulation of the TS gene 
      expression. This is the first study that compares multi-variant TS genotypes in 
      different clinical specimens.

TI  - Significant association between methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 677T allele 
      and hyperuricemia among adult Japanese subjects.
PG  - 710-5

AB  - It is well known that high serum uric acid (SUA) is the cause of gout and a risk 
      factor of cardiovascular diseases. Although SUA is thought to have an association 
      with folate metabolism through elevated production and/or damaged renal 
      excretion, studies on functional polymorphisms of folate metabolizing are still 
      limited, showing inconsistent findings. We hypothesized that hyperuricemia would 
      be associated with methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T and 
      thymidylate synthase (TS) 28-bp tandem repeat polymorphism. Subjects were 793 
      healthy health checkup examinees (272 male and 521 female Japanese) aged 39 years 
      or older. There was no clear difference in SUA means among those with different 
      genotypes of MTHFR and TS, but a significant association between hyperuricemia 
      (SUA > or =7mg/dL) and MTHFR 677T allele carriers was observed. The odds ratio of 
      harboring 677T allele adjusted for sex, age, body mass index, serum creatinine, 
      systolic blood pressure, currents habits of smoking and drinking, and TS genotype 
      was 2.77 (95% confidence interval, 1.38-5.56). The TS genotype was not 
      significantly associated with hyperuricemia; the corresponding adjusted odds 
      ratio was 1.36 (95% confidence interval, 0.75-2.48) for non-33 genotype relative 
      to 33 genotype. Because MTHFR 677CC was rarer both in <4 mg/dL group and > or =7 
      mg/dL group, the comparisons of SUA means were not useful to elucidate the roles 
      of the polymorphism. This new view may partly explain the inconsistent results on 
      the association of the MTHFR polymorphism with SUA.

TI  - Relationship of polymorphism of the tandem repeat sequence in the thymidylate 
      synthase gene and the survival of stage III colorectal cancer patients receiving 
      adjuvant 5-flurouracil-based chemotherapy.
PG  - 22-7
LID - 10.1002/jso.21412 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine whether the different 
      polymorphisms in the thymidylate synthase (TS) gene, novel G>C single nucleotide 
      polymorphism (SNP) and variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR), may be related 
      with disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with stage III colorectal cancer 
      receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS: The study included 201 patients with 
      pathologic TNM stage III colon cancer who received adjuvant 5-fluorouracil 
      (5-FU)-based chemotherapy after surgery. DNA was extracted from fresh tumor 
      tissue and sequenced. Patients with TS genotypes of 2R3G, 3C3G, or 3G3G were 
      assigned to a high expression group, and those with 2R2R, 2R3C, or 3C3C, to a low 
      expression group. RESULTS: Frequencies of the TS tandem repeat polymorphisms 
      among the tumor genotypes were 6.0% in 2R2R, 25.4% in 2R3R, and 68.7% in 3R3R. 
      The low expression group included 52 patients (25.9%), and the high expression 
      group included 149 patients (74.1%). Groups classified according to possession of 
      VNTR, SNP, and low- or high-expression genotypes did not differ significantly in 
      DFS. In multivariate analysis, only tumor stage showed significant prognostic 
      value (hazard ratio (HR) 2.05, 95% CI = 1.24-3.37, P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: TS 
      polymorphisms do not predict clinical outcome of colorectal cancer patients 
      treated with adjuvant 5-FU-based chemotherapy.

TI  - Polymorphisms in the enhancer region of the thymidylate synthase gene are 
      associated with thymidylate synthase levels in normal tissues but not in 
      malignant tissues of patients with colorectal cancer.
PG  - 146-54
LID - 10.3816/CCC.2009.n.024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The enhancer region of the thymidylate synthase (TS) gene (TSER) 
      contains a polymorphic tandem repeat sequence (2 or 3 repeats, 2R or 3R) and a 
      single-nucleotide polymorphism (G > C) within the second repeat of the 3R alleles 
      which might influence TS expression/activity and response to fluoropyrimidines. 
      However, clinical studies in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) failed to find 
      a consistent relationship between TSER polymorphisms and protein levels as well 
      as with clinical outcome. The analysis of the relationship between TSER genotype 
      and TS mRNA and activity in normal and malignant tissues might explain the 
      previous controversial data and help in the selection of useful markers to 
      predict drug response and/or toxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To address this 
      issue, we studied TSER genotype, TS expression, and activity with specific 
      polymerase chain reaction and activity assays (TS catalytic activity and FdUMP 
      binding) in normal (liver, mucosa) and malignant (primary tumor and liver 
      metastasis) tissues from 83 patients with CRC. RESULTS: No correlation between 
      TSER genotype and TS mRNA and protein levels was observed in malignant tissues. 
      In contrast, normal tissues harboring one or two 3RG alleles were characterized 
      by higher TS protein levels (2.4-fold; P = .008) and catalytic activity (P < .05) 
      compared with the other TSER genotypes. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that 
      TSER polymorphisms do not predict tumoral TS levels possibly depending on altered 
      TS regulation in cancer tissues, and might explain the lack of clear correlation 
      with clinical outcome after chemotherapy with fluoropyrimidines. However, the 
      relationship between TS phenotype and TSER genotype in normal tissues warrants 
      further investigations in large-scale prospective studies evaluating TS genotype 
      and fluoropyrimidine tolerability.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To analyze and compare radiologic lung expansion after talc 
      pleurodesis performed either by videothoracoscopy or chest tube and correlate it 
      with clinical outcome. Secondary end points evaluated were as follows: clinical 
      efficacy; quality of life; safety; and survival. METHODS: Prospective randomized 
      study that included 60 patients (45 women, 15 men; mean age, 55.2 years) with 
      recurrent malignant pleural effusion between January 2005 and January 2008. They 
      were randomized into the following two groups: video-assisted thoracic surgery 
      (VATS) talc poudrage; and talc slurry (TS) administered through a chest tube. 
      Lung expansion was evaluated through chest CT scans obtained 0, 1, 3 and 6 months 
      after pleurodesis. Complications, drainage time, hospital stay, and quality of 
      life (Medical Outcomes Study 36-item short form and World Health Organization 
      quality-of-life questionnaires) were also analyzed. RESULTS: There were no 
      significant differences in preprocedure clinical and pathologic variables between 
      groups. The immediate total (ie, > 90%) lung expansion was observed in 27 
      patients (45%) and was more frequent in the VATS group (60% vs 30%, respectively; 
      p = 0.027). During follow-up, 71% of the patients showed unaltered or improved 
      lung expansion and 9 patients (15%) needed new pleural procedures (VATS group, 5 
      recurrences; TS group, 4 recurrences; p = 0.999). No differences were found 
      between groups regarding quality of life, complications, drainage time, hospital 
      stay, and survival. Immediate lung expansion did not correlate with radiologic 
      recurrence, clinical recurrence, or complications (p = 0.60, 0.15, and 0.20, 
      respectively). CONCLUSION: Immediate partial lung expansion was a frequent 
      finding and was more frequent after TS. Nonetheless, no correlation between 
      immediate lung expansion and clinical outcome was found in this study. TRIAL

TI  - Thymidylate synthetase allelic imbalance in clear cell renal carcinoma.
PG  - 1195-200
LID - 10.1007/s00280-009-0986-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the allelic status of the thymidylate synthetase (TYMS) 
      gene, located at chromosome band 18p11.32, in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). TYMS is 
      a key target of the 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based class of drugs, frequently 
      considered in combination therapies in advanced RCC. TYMS variants, such as the 
      TYMS polymorphic 5'-untranslated region variable number tandem repeat sequence 
      (VNTR), are under investigation to guide 5-FU treatment. Yet, no information is 
      available with regard to changes in TYMS allele frequencies in RCC malignances. 
      METHODS: Blood and matched tumor samples were collected from 41 histological 
      proven clear cell RCC affected patients (30 males, 11 females.). TYMS VNTR 
      genotype was first determined in blood to identify heterozygotes employing PCR 
      techniques. To evaluate for allelic imbalance, fragment analysis was performed 
      both in blood and matched tumor DNA of the heterozygote patients. Microsatellite 
      analysis, employing the markers D18S59 and D18S476 mapping, respectively, at the 
      TYMS locus (18p11.32) and 1.5 Mb downstream of the TYMS gene sequence (18p11.31), 
      was performed to confirm TYMS allelic imbalance in tumors. RESULTS: Germ-line 
      TYMS VNTR distribution was: 2R/2R (19.5%), TYMS 2R/3R (36.6%) and TYMS 3R/3R 
      (43.9%). Allelic imbalance for the TYMS tandem repeat region was detected in 
      26.6% of the heterozygote patients. Microsatellite analysis confirmed the allelic 
      imbalance detected by TYMS VNTR analysis and revealed that the overall frequence 
      of allelic imbalance of chromosome band 18p11.32 was 35%, while the overall 
      allelic imbalance of chromosome band 18p11.31 was 28%. CONCLUSIONS: By focusing 
      on the TYMS polymorphic variants in renal cancer, we here provide evidence, to 
      our knowledge, for the first time showing loss of 18p11.32 and 18p11.31 in renal 
      cell carcinomas. As allelic imbalances involving TYMS locus may be an important 
      variable affecting 5-FU responsiveness, this study may contribute to explain 
      different responses of advanced RCC in combined chemotherapeutic regimens 
      incorporating fluoropyridines.

TI  - Abnormal motor cortex excitability in preclinical and very early Huntington's 
      disease.
PG  - 959-65
LID - 10.1016/j.biopsych.2008.12.026 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Huntington's disease (HD), the cerebral cortex is involved early 
      in the disease process. The study of cortical excitability can therefore 
      contribute to understanding HD pathophysiology. METHODS: With transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation (TMS) we examined motor cortex excitability in 8 premanifest 
      HD gene carriers, 8 very early symptomatic HD patients, and 22 healthy control 
      subjects. Electrophysiological measures were correlated with the clinical stage 
      of HD to identify motor cortical dysfunction before overt clinical disease onset. 
      RESULTS: Premanifest and early manifest HD patients had higher resting and active 
      motor cortex thresholds than control subjects (p = .024). At rest, recruitment of 
      motor evoked potentials was more gradual in both patient groups than in control 
      subjects (p = .001). When active, recruitment and the duration of the cortical 
      silent period were similar in all groups. There was a tendency for short interval 
      intra-cortical inhibition to have a higher threshold in all patients taken 
      together but not in each group separately. Short latency afferent inhibition 
      (SAI) was reduced in early manifest patients compared with control subjects and 
      premanifest patients (p < .001) and in contrast to all other measures was 
      inversely associated with estimated time to onset (p = .013, adjusted R(2) = .32) 
      and the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale motor score (p = .001, adjusted 
      R(2) = .5). A combination of age, CAG repeat length, and SAI strongly predicted 
      the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale motor score (p = .001, adjusted 
      R(2) = .68). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings add to the evidence for early cortical 
      involvement in HD possibly before HD signs appear.

TI  - Combination of polymorphisms within 5' and 3' untranslated regions of thymidylate 
      synthase gene modulates survival in 5 fluorouracil-treated colorectal cancer 
      patients.
PG  - 219-29
AB  - In the present study we explored the effect of three polymorphisms of the TS gene 
      on overall and progression- free survival of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients 
      subjected to 5FU chemotherapy. A 28 bp variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR), 
      a G/C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and a deletion of 6 bp at position 
      1494 were studied. The possible combined effect of these DNA polymorphisms on the 
      clinical outcome of patients was also evaluated. A retrospective study was 
      carried out on paraffin-embedded sections from 113 patients diagnosed of advanced 
      CRC. TS genotyping methods were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for VNTR and PCR, 
      followed by restriction length fragment polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) for SNP and 
      ins/del 6 bp. To study the combined effect of TS polymorphisms, four categories 
      were defined accordingly to the level of expression attributed to SNP and ins/del 
      6 bp genotypes: C&allele 6-, C&6+/6+, G&allele6- and G&6+/6+. VNTR and ins/del 6 
      bp genotypes varied with tumour anatomical site: 2R/2R genotype was rare in 
      left-sided tumours (7.0% vs. 26.3% of right-sided and 24.1% of rectal cancers; 
      P<0.01), where the variant allele 6- was very frequent (69.0%). Instead, most 
      patients with right-sided tumours were wild-type homozygous 6+/6+ (63.9%) 
      (P<0.01). Heterozygous 6+/6- genotype was more frequent among tumours classified 
      as C (50.0%) and D (76.5%) Dukes stages (P=0.05). None of the studied 
      polymorphisms alone affected overall or progression-free survival (PFS). C&6+/6+ 
      and G&6+/6+ combined genotypes were respectively associated to the best and worst 
      PFS (P=0.03 when compared with each other), while combinations carrying the 
      allele 6- determined an intermediate evolution that might be indicative of a 
      variable response to chemotherapy. The rate of Dukes B stage tumours was 
      unexpectedly high (59.1%) among patients with the unfavourable G&6+/6+ 
      combination. In our study the combination of high TS expression genotypes G&6+/6+ 
      identifies a group of high risk within CRC patients treated with 5FU.

AB  - Effect of alcohol consumption on pancreatic cancer risk has been investigated in 
      many studies, but results have been inconsistent. We conducted a case-control 
      study to assess the effect of alcohol on pancreatic cancer in conjunction with 
      polymorphisms in one-carbon metabolism enzymes, methylenetetrahydrofolate 
      reductase (MTHFR C677T), methionine synthase (MTR A2756G), methionine synthase 
      reductase (MTRR A66G), and thymidylate synthase (TS) variable number of tandem 
      repeat. A total of 157 pancreatic cancer patients and 785 age- and sex- matched 
      control subjects were genotyped for polymorphisms. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% 
      confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated using unconditional logistic models 
      adjusted for potential confounders. Heavy alcohol drinking was marginally 
      associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 
      1.00-3.62). None of the polymorphisms showed any significant effect on pancreatic 
      cancer risk by genotype alone. In stratified analysis, effect of alcohol 
      consumption on pancreatic cancer was observed in individuals with the MTHFR 667 
      CC, MTR 2756 AA, or MTRR 66 G allele. OR (95% CI) of pancreatic cancer for heavy 
      drinkers compared with never drinkers was 4.50 (1.44-14.05) in the MTHFR 667 CC 
      genotype, 2.65 (1.17-6.00) in the MTR 2756 AA genotype, and 3.35 (1.34-8.36) in 
      the MTRR 66 G allele carriers. These results suggest that the folate-related 
      enzyme polymorphism modifies the association between drinking habit and 
      pancreatic cancer risk.

AB  - We investigated the association between thymidylate synthase (TS) germline 
      polymorphisms and response to 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy in 80 patients 
      with liver-only metastatic colorectal cancer (MCRC). The tandem repeat 
      polymorphism (VNTR) in TS 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR), which consists of two 
      (2R) or three (3R) 28-bp repeated sequences, with or without a G/C nucleotide 
      change in 3R carriers (3G or 3C) and a 6-bp insertion/deletion (6+/6-) in the TS 
      3'-UTR, was studied. The distinction between high (2R/3G, 3C/3G and 3G/3G) and 
      low (2R/2R, 2R/3C and 3C/3C) TS expression genotypes according to the 5'-UTR 
      VNTR+G/C nucleotide change showed significant association with tumour response 
      (P=0.01). In particular, high TS expression genotypes were found in 8 out of 34 
      patients (23.5%) with complete or partial response and in 24 out of 46 patients 
      (52%) with stable disease and disease progression. Liver-only MCRC patients are a 
      homogeneous and clinical relevant subgroup that may represent an ideal setting 
      for studying the actual influence of TS polymorphisms.

TI  - The polymorphisms of TS and MTHFR predict survival of gastric cancer patients 
      treated with fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy in Chinese population.
PG  - 911-8
LID - 10.1007/s00280-008-0815-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of the 
      thymidylate synthase (TS) and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 
      polymorphisms with the clinical outcomes of gastric cancer patients treated with 
      5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS: One-hundred and sixteen patients with 
      gastric cancer were treated with 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy. The TS (a 
      28-bp tandem repeat polymorphism in the TS enhancer region (TSER) and a 6 bp 
      deletion/insertion polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated region) and MTHFR C677T 
      polymorphisms were determined in blood samples from those patients using PCR and 
      PCR-LDR (ligation detection reaction) method, respectively. RESULTS: The overall 
      survival (OS) in patients with the TS ins6/ins6 genotype was significantly 
      shorter than those in patients with the del6/del6 (P = 0.017) and ins6/del6 (P = 
      0.022) genotype. The relapse-free survival (RFS) and OS in patients with the 
      MTHFR C/C genotype were significantly worse than those in patients with the T/T 
      or C/T genotype (P = 0.043 and 0.040, respectively). Cox multivariate analysis 
      also showed that patients with the TS ins6/ins6 genotype have worse OS than 
      patients with the T/T or C/T genotype (HR = 2.437, P = 0.041), and the MTHFR C/C 
      genotype was associated with shorter RFS (HR = 1.723, P = 0.031) and OS (HR = 
      1.681, P = 0.056). No significant association was found between the TSER 
      polymorphism and the clinical outcomes (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The polymorphisms 
      of TS 3'-UTR ins6/del6 and MTHFR C677T appear to be potential prognostic factors 
      in gastric cancer patients treated with 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy, which 
      may allow identification of gastric cancer patients who will benefit from 5-FU 
      chemotherapy.

      immunohistochemistry in patients with colon cancer.
PG  - 1941-9
LID - 10.1002/ijc.23740 [doi]
AB  - Thymidylate synthase (TS) is a potentially valuable marker for therapy response 
      since it is the molecular target of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). TS can be analyzed at 
      the DNA (gene polymorphisms and amplification) and protein level 
      (immunohistochemistry). This study investigated the predictive role of TS at the 
      DNA and protein levels in patients with N(+) colon cancer (n = 38). Tumor and 
      normal tissues were genotyped using PCR for variable number of tandem repeats 
      (VNTR), a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 3R allele and a 6 bp 
      deletion (1494del6) in the TS gene. Tumor tissues were additionally analyzed for 
      loss of heterozygosity (VNTR polymorphism). A newly developed real time PCR assay 
      was used to detect the presence of TS gene amplifications in tumor tissues. VNTR 
      analysis in normal tissue was significantly associated with distant tumor 
      recurrence (8% for 2R/2R vs. 52% for patients carrying a 3R allele, p = 0.038) 
      and cancer-specific survival (p = 0.021). IHC was not found to be significantly 
      associated with patients' outcome. No correlations between TS gene polymorphisms 
      and IHC were found. However, TS gene amplification was correlated with a strong 
      IHC staining intensity. In conclusion, this study indicates that DNA based 
      analysis is more predictive for patients' outcome than TS IHC.

TI  - Folate pathway genetic polymorphisms and susceptibility of central nervous system 
      tumors in Thai children.
PG  - 72-8
LID - 10.1016/j.cdp.2008.02.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Folate is an important micronutrient molecule participating in DNA 
      synthesis, methylation and repair mechanisms. Genetic polymorphisms in folate 
      pathway related enzymes including methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 
      C677T and A1298C, methionine synthase (MTR) A2756G, thymidylate synthase (TS) 
      28-bp tandem repeat, and reduced folate carrier (RFC) G80A have been shown to be 
      associated with increased susceptibility for several cancers. The aim of the 
      present study was to evaluate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms in the 
      genes encoding enzymes of the folate pathway predispose to any CNS tumors in Thai 
      children. METHODS: In the present case-control study, we investigated these 
      polymorphisms in genomic DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells in 73 Thai 
      children with various types of central nervous system tumors and in 205 age and 
      sex matched controls. RESULTS: Thirty-one out of 73 patients were diagnosed with 
      glial tumors (astrocytoma, oigodendroglioma and ependymoma), 28 with embryonal 
      CNS tumors (medulloblastoma, pinealoblastoma and primitive neuroectodermal 
      tumor), 13 with germ cell tumors and 1 with meningioma. We found that the 
      homozygous CC allele of MTHFR A1298C conferred an increased risk of embryonal CNS 
      tumors (OR: 3.9; 95% CI: 1.3-11.4, p=0.02). CONCLUSION: Our findings thus suggest 
      that folate metabolism may play a role in the pathogenesis of certain specific 
      subtypes of pediatric brain tumor in Thai children, especially embryonal CNS 
      tumors.

TI  - Size of the exon 1-CAG repeats of the androgen receptor gene employed as a 
      molecular marker in the diagnosis of Turner syndrome in girls with short stature.
PG  - 43-9
AB  - Turner syndrome (TS) is one of the most common chromosomal abnormalities among 
      girls. Complete monosomy of X chromosome is responsible for almost 50% of all 
      cases of TS, and mosaicism and X anomaly are detected in the other half. It has 
      already been demonstrated that early diagnosis of these children allows 
      appropriate growth hormone treatment with better final height prognosis and 
      introduction of estrogen at an ideal chronological age. Sixty-four short-stature 
      girls were selected and the clinical data obtained were birth weight and height, 
      weight and height at the first medical visit and target height. Other clinical 
      data including cardiac and renal abnormalities, otitis, Hashimoto thyroiditis, 
      cubitus valgus, short neck, widely separated nipples, and pigmented nevi were 
      obtained from the patients' medical records. The aim of the present study was to 
      evaluate the screening of a group of short-stature girls for TS based on the 
      number of CAG repeats of the androgen receptor gene analyzed by GeneScan 
      software. Patient samples with two alleles (heterozygous) were 49/64 (76.5%) and 
      with one allele (homozygous) were 15/64 (23.5%). A karyotype was determined in 30 
      patients, 9 homozygous and 21 heterozygous. In the homozygous group, 6/9 were 
      45,X and 3/9 were 46,XX. In the heterozygous group, 17/21 were 46,XX, and 4/21 
      were TS patients with mosaicism (45,X/46,XX; 45,X/46XiXq; 46XdelXp). The pattern 
      obtained by GeneScan in two patients with mosaicism in the karyotype was an 
      imbalance between the peak heights of the two alleles, suggesting that this 
      imbalance could be present when there is a mosaicism. The frequency of TS 
      abnormalities (18.7%) did not differ between TS and 46,XX girls. Thus, it is 
      important to accurately assess the incidence of TS in growth-retarded girls, even 
      in the absence of other dysmorphisms. In this study, we diagnosed 6 cases of TS 
      45,X (9.4%) by molecular analysis, with a 100% sensitivity and 85% specificity. 
      This molecular analysis was able to detect all cases of TS 45,X and the majority 
      of mosaicisms, without the need for more X chromosome markers. In conclusion, 
      determining the number of CAG repeats of the androgen receptor gene analyzed by 
      GeneScan was a fast method with high sensitivity for the detection of TS 45,X, 
      suggesting that it could be interesting as a method for screening a population of 
      growth-retarded girls.

TI  - ERCC2 2251A>C genetic polymorphism was highly correlated with early relapse in 
      high-risk stage II and stage III colorectal cancer patients: a preliminary study.
PG  - 50
LID - 10.1186/1471-2407-8-50 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Early relapse in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients is attributed 
      mainly to the higher malignant entity (such as an unfavorable genotype, deeper 
      tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis and advance cancer stage) and poor response 
      to chemotherapy. Several investigations have demonstrated that genetic 
      polymorphisms in drug-targeted genes, metabolizing enzymes, and DNA-repairing 
      enzymes are all strongly correlated with inter-individual differences in the 
      efficacy and toxicity of many treatment regimens. This preliminary study attempts 
      to identify the correlation between genetic polymorphisms and clinicopathological 
      features of CRC, and evaluates the relationship between genetic polymorphisms and 
      chemotherapeutic susceptibility of Taiwanese CRC patients. To our knowledge, this 
      study discusses, for the first time, early cancer relapse and its indication by 
      multiple genes. METHODS: Six gene polymorphisms functional in drug-metabolism - 
      GSTP1 Ile105Val, ABCB1 Ile1145Ile, MTHFR Ala222Val, TYMS double (2R) or triple 
      (3R) tandem repeat - and DNA-repair genes - ERCC2 Lys751Gln and XRCC1 Arg399Gln - 
      were assessed in 201 CRC patients using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction 
      fragment-length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique and DNA sequencing. Patients 
      were diagnosed as either high-risk stage II (T2 and 3 N0 M0) or III (any T N1 and 
      2 M0) and were administered adjuvant chemotherapy regimens that included 
      5-fluorouracil (5FU) and leucovorin (LV). The correlations between genetic 
      polymorphisms and patient clinicopathological features and relapses were 
      investigated. RESULTS: In this study, the distributions of GSTP1 (P = 0.003), 
      ABCB1 (P = 0.001), TYMS (P < 0.0001), ERCC2 (P < 0.0001) and XRCC1 (P = 0.006) 
      genotypes in the Asian population, with the exception of MTHFR (P = 0.081), 
      differed significantly from their distributions in a Caucasian population. 
      However, the unfavorable genotype ERCC2 2251A>C (P = 0.006), tumor invasion depth 
      (P = 0.025), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.011) and cancer stage (P = 0.008) were 
      significantly correlated with early relapse. Patients carrying the ERCC2 2251AC 
      or2251CC genotypes had a significantly increased risk of early relapse (OR = 
      3.294, 95% CI, 1.272-8.532). CONCLUSION: We suggest that ERCC2 2251A>C alleles 
      may be genetic predictors of early CRC relapse.

TI  - Polymorphism of thymidylate synthase gene associated with its protein expression 
      in human colon cancer.
PG  - 617-21
AB  - AIM: To correlate the polymorphisms in the 5'-untranslated region with 
      thymidylate synthase (TS) protein expression in Han Chinese colonic neoplasms. 
      METHODS: Adenocarcinoma samples were from 68 patients who received no treatment 
      before surgery. Tandem repeat length of TS gene was determined by PCR 
      amplification of genomic DNA. Intratumoral TS protein expression was studied 
      immunohistochemically in corresponding sections from paraffin-embedded primary 
      foci. Immunoreactivity was semiquantitatively evaluated by immunoreactivity score 
      (IRS). RESULTS: Double-(2R) and triple-repeated (3R) sequences of the TS gene 
      were found in the cancer tissues. Three genotypes of TS were found: 2R/2R (n=6), 
      2R/3R (n=22) and 3R/3R (n=40). Patients who were homozygous for triple-repeated 
      (3R/3R) sequences showed significantly higher IRS of TS than patients who were 
      homozygous for double-repeated (2R/2R) sequences or heterozygous patients 
      (2R/3R): 5.73+/-3.25 vs 2.17+/-1.47 or 3.77+/-2.64, P=0.008 or P=0.015. But no 
      statistical significance of IRS in cancer tissues was observed between 2R/3R 
      genotype and 2R/2R genotype. CONCLUSION: There is a relationship between TS 
      genotype and TS protein expression in clinical specimens. The data might offer an 
      advantage for selection of Chinese cancer patients to receive fluoropyrimidines 
      treatment.

TI  - Multiple Genetic Polymorphisms of GSTP1 313AG, MDR1 3435CC, and MTHFR 677CC 
      highly correlated with early relapse of breast cancer patients in Taiwan.
PG  - 872-80
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genetic polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes, transporters, 
      receptors, and other drug targets have been linked to inter-individual 
      differences in the efficacy and toxicity of many medications. In the present 
      study, multiple chemotherapeutic agent-related genetic polymorphisms, including 
      GSTP1, MDR1, MTHFR, and TS tandem repeats, were analyzed in breast cancer 
      patients and studied in correlation with the clinical outcome of patients 
      receiving FEC adjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS: The genotypes from 192 stage II and 
      III breast cancer patients who underwent operations and received six cycles of 
      postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy (FEC) were determined by means of PCR-RFLP. 
      The association of each genetic polymorphism with clinicopathological data of 
      patients and early relapse status were analyzed. RESULTS: The results showed that 
      the genotype distribution of GSTP1 A313G, MTHFR C677T, and TS 3R3R in Taiwanese 
      subjects differed significantly from the distribution in Caucasians. After 
      analysis of the relationship between the genotypes and clinicopathological data 
      of the patients, a significant correlation was observed between postoperative 
      early relapse in patients with genetic polymorphisms of both MDR1 3435CC and 
      MTHFR 677CC (crude OR: 2.609, P = .013) and patients with additional GSTP1 313AG 
      genetic polymorphism (crude OR: 2.833, P = .017). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the 
      present study highly suggest that GSTP1, MDR1, and MTHFR genotypes could be 
      prognostic factors for Taiwanese patients with breast cancer.

TI  - Dopaminergic candidate genes in Tourette syndrome: association between tic 
      severity and 3' UTR polymorphism of the dopamine transporter gene.
PG  - 900-5
AB  - Multiple evidence suggests an involvement of the dopamine neurotransmitter system 
      in Tourette syndrome (TS). Therefore, dopaminergic candidate genes are in the 
      center of genetic association analyses of TS. In this study, 103 TS patients and 
      their parents have been characterized for different dopamine-related 
      polymorphisms including the 48 bp variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) of the 
      dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) gene, the 40 bp VNTR of the dopamine transporter 
      (DAT1, SLC6A3) gene and the Val158Met polymorphism of the 
      catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene. In addition, the 120 bp duplication and 
      three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were assessed in the promoter region 
      of the DRD4 gene. The -616G allele and the 2-G-A-C haplotype (i.e., the 2-repeat 
      form of the 120 bp sequence approximately -616G approximately -615A approximately 
      -521C combination) were preferentially transmitted, however, these results did 
      not remain significant after correction for multiple testing. Case-control 
      analyses have also been carried out, resulting in negative findings. On the other 
      hand, using a dimensional approach, the DAT1 40 bp VNTR showed an association 
      with the peak tic-severity as measured by the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale. 
      Patients with at least one copy of the 9-repeat allele had significantly more 
      severe symptoms than individuals with the homozygous 10/10 genotype (P = 0.002). 
      In summary, allele frequencies did not differ between cases and controls, but 
      DAT1 genotype accounted for variations of tic severity within the TS group.

TI  - No associations of Helicobacter pylori infection and gastric atrophy with plasma 
      total homocysteine in Japanese.
PG  - 98-104
AB  - Recent studies have suggested that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection 
      might be a risk factor for atherosclerosis. Since the bacterium has not been 
      isolated from atherosclerotic lesions, a direct role in atherogenesis is not 
      plausible. We examined associations of plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) and serum 
      folate, independent risk factors for atherosclerosis, with H. pylori infection 
      and subsequent gastric atrophy among 174 patients (78 males and 96 females) aged 
      20 to 73 years, who visited an H. pylori eradication clinic of Nagoya University 
      from July 2004 to October 2005. Polymorphism genotyping was conducted for 
      methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T and thymidylate synthase (TS) 
      28-bp tandem repeats by PCR with confronting two-pair primers and PCR, 
      respectively. H. pylori infection and gastric atrophy were not significantly 
      associated with hyperhomocysteinemia (tHcy > or = 12 nmol/ml), when adjusted by 
      sex, age, smoking, alcohol, and genotypes of MTHFR and TS. The adjusted odds 
      ratio of gastric atrophy for low folate level (< or = 4 mg/ml) was 0.21 (95% 
      confidence interval = 0.05-0.78). The associations of tHcy with serum folate and 
      MTHFR genotype were clearly observed in this dataset. The present study 
      demonstrated that folate and MTHFR genotype were the deterministic factors of

      indicating that even if H. pylori infection influences the risk of 
      atherosclerosis, the influence may not be through the elevation of homocysteine.

TI  - Identification of a novel single nucleotide polymorphism in the first tandem 
      repeat sequence of the thymidylate synthase 2R allele.
PG  - 1930-4
AB  - Thymidylate synthase (TS) activity is an important determinant of response to 
      chemotherapy with fluoropyrimidine prodrugs and its expression is largely 
      determined by the number of functional upstream stimulatory factor (USF) E-box 
      consensus elements present in the 5'regulatory region of the TYMS gene. Two known 
      polymorphisms in this area, a variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) consisting 
      of 2 or 3 repeats (2R/3R) of a 28-bp sequence and a further G > C single 
      nucleotide substitution within the second repeat of the 3R, result in genotypes 
      with between 2 and 4 functional repeats in most humans. Here, we identify a 
      further G > C SNP in the first repeat of the TYMS 2R allele, which effectively 
      abolishes the only functional USF protein binding site in this promoter. The 
      frequency of the new allele was found to be 4.2% (95% CI = 1.4-9.6%), accounting 
      for 8.8% (95% CI = 2.9-19.3%) of all 2R alleles in our patient cohort. Thus, we 
      observed that the lowest number of inherited functional binding sites is 1 
      instead of 2 as previously thought, and could potentially be 0 in a homozygous 
      individual. This would severely decrease TS expression and may have implications 
      for predicting efficacy and toxicity of therapy with commonly used 
      fluorouracil-based therapy regimes.

TI  - Combined analysis of genetic polymorphisms in thymidylate synthase, uridine 
      diphosphate glucoronosyltransferase and X-ray cross complementing factor 1 genes 
      as a prognostic factor in advanced colorectal cancer patients treated with 
      5-fluorouracil plus oxaliplatin or irinotecan.
PG  - 637-45
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of combining thymidylate 
      synthase (TS), X-ray cross complementing factor 1 (XRCC1) and uridine diphosphate 
      glucoronosyltransferase (UGT1A1 *28) polymorphism genotypes in response rate and 
      time to progression (TTP) in metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with 
      5-fluorouracil (5-FU) plus irinotecan or oxaliplatin (OXA). PCR, RFLP, allelic 
      discrimination and direct sequencing were performed to elucidate TS, XRCC1 and 
      UGT1A1 *28 genotypes in blood from 71 patients. Patients with a number of 
      favourable genotypes (NFG) > or =1 had a lower progression rate and a better TTP 
      than patients with NFG=0 (log-rank p<0.03). In the OXA + 5-FU group, patients 
      with the TS 5' single nucleotide polymorphism and/or XRCC1 genotypes favourable 
      to treatment had a better TTP (log-rank p=0.02). The TS 5' tandem repeat 
      polymorphism and the NFG were independent prognostic factors in the Cox-based 
      multivariate analysis (p<0.03). These results confirm the influence on patient 
      out-come of these genetic polymorphisms and the possibility of studying them 
      together to predict the outcome in first-line treated colorectal cancer patients.

TI  - Fourteen novel genetic variations and haplotype structures of the TYMS gene 
      encoding human thymidylate synthase (TS).
PG  - 509-16
AB  - Forty genetic variations including 14 novel ones were found in the human TYMS 
      gene, which encodes thymidylate synthase, in 263 Japanese cancer patients who 
      received 5-fluorouracil (FU)-based chemotherapy. Three novel variations were 
      located within the 28-bp tandem repeat sequence in the 5'-untranslated region 
      (UTR) and were designated 5Rc, 3Rc-ins and 4Rc. Allele frequencies were 0.021 for 
      5Rc, 0.006 for 3Rc-ins and 0.002 for 4Rc. Other novel variations included -133G>C 
      and -125G>C in the 5'-UTR; IVS1-278G>A, IVS2-68C>T, IVS2-23T>C, 
      IVS4+122_+123insATTG, IVS4-141G>A, IVS5-100A>T and IVS6-111G>A in the introns; 
      and 1244(*302)A>G and 1264(*322)G>A in the 3'-UTR. The allele frequencies were 
      0.34 for IVS4+122_+123insATTG, 0.042 for -133G>C, 0.011 for IVS4-141G>A, 0.006 
      for -125G>C, 0.004 for IVS1-278G>A, IVS2-68C>T, 1244(*302)A>G and 1264(*322)G>A, 
      and 0.002 for IVS2-23T>C, IVS5-100A>T and IVS6-111G>A. Using the detected 
      polymorphisms, linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis was performed, which divided 
      the TYMS gene into three LD blocks. The 28-bp tandem repeat sequence in the 
      5'-UTR was assigned as Block 2 with a total of 7 alleles. In Blocks 1 and 3, 7 
      and 19 haplotypes were determined/inferred, respectively. Our findings provide 
      fundamental and useful information for genotyping TYMS in the Japanese and 
      probably other Asian populations.

TI  - Polymorphisms of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR C677T) and 
      thymidylate synthase enhancer region (TSER) as a risk factor of 
      cholangiocarcinoma in a Korean population.
PG  - 4229-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: 5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), a key enzyme in 
      folate metabolism, plays a major role in the provision of methyl groups for DNA 
      methylation; thymidylate synthase (TS) is a rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis 
      of dTMP and DNA repair. The clinical role of genetic polymorphisms of MTHFR and 
      that of the TS enhancer region (TSER) were demonstrated in several clinical 
      studies with colorectal, esophageal, gastric and breast cancer. However, there 
      have never been any studies on the association between cholangiocarcinoma (CCC) 
      and genetic polymorphisms of MTHFR and TSER. Therefore, the polymorphism of MTHFR 
      and TSER, which share a common substrate, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, in CCC 
      was examined, concurrently. The influence of these polymorphisms on plasma 
      homocysteine levels was also investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Blood samples 
      were obtained from 47 patients with CCC and 204 healthy control donors. Using 
      polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism 
      (PCR-RFLP), the C to T transition at position 677 of MTHFR and tandem repeat of 
      28bp in the enhancer region of TS gene were analyzed. Plasma homocysteine levels 
      were also determined. RESULTS: According to the logistic regression model, a 
      combination of MTHFR 677CC with the TSER 2R(+) genotype had a relative risk of 
      5.38 (95% CI, 1.23-23.56) of developing CCC compared to MTHFR 677CC with TSER 
      2R(-) (p = 0.0257). The level of homocysteine was lower in CCC patients than 
      healthy controls without statistical significance (8.27 +/- 4.17 vs. 9.40 +/- 
      2.57, p = 0.093). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest a role of MTHFR 677CC with the 
      TSER 2R(+) genotype in increasing the risk of CCC. This study is the first to 
      suggest an association between CCC and the polymorphisms of MTHFR and TSER.

TI  - Pharmacogenetic study of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and thymidylate 
      synthase in Japanese and assessment of ethnic and gender differences.
PG  - 41-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We investigated the four polymorphisms of the 
      5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and thymidylate synthase (TYMS) 
      genes that are related to the pharmacologically active sites of methotrexate for 
      the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in 102 healthy Japanese adults and assessed 
      the possibility of ethnic and gender differences. METHODS: Polymorphisms of MTHFR 
      C677T, A1298C, the two or three 28-bp tandem repeats in the TYMS 5'-untranslated 
      regions (UTR), and the 6-bp deletion/insertion in the TYMS 3'-UTR were measured 
      using polymerase chain reaction with restriction fragment length polymorphism 
      method. Published data on allelic frequencies by ethnic group and gender were 
      collected from Medline. RESULTS: Allelic frequencies in healthy Japanese adults 
      were: MTHFR 677T allele 41%, MTHFR 1298C allele 22%, TYMS 5'-UTR 3R allele 84%, 
      and TYMS 3'-UTR-6-bp allele 59%. Significant differences were found in the 
      distribution of MTHFR C677T between black and Japanese populations, of TYMS 
      5'-UTR alleles between Caucasian or black and Japanese populations, and of TYMS 
      3'-UTR alleles between Caucasian and Japanese populations (p < 0.001). Moreover, 
      a gender difference was found in TYMS 3'-UTR allelic frequency in Japanese (p = 
      0.015). CONCLUSION: Ethnic and gender variations in the distribution of these 
      allelic frequencies may associate with the difference in the effects of 
      methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis patients.

TI  - A haplotype of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene predicts poor tumor 
      response in rectal cancer patients receiving preoperative chemoradiation.
PG  - 817-24
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to evaluate whether germline 
      methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T and A1298C polymorphisms as 
      well as polymorphisms in the thymidylate synthase gene promoter, namely the 
      variable number tandem repeat polymorphism (TS VNTR) and the intrarepeat G to C 
      single nucleotide polymorphism (TS SNP), are predictive markers of tumor 
      regression in rectal cancer patients following preoperative chemoradiotherapy. 
      BASIC METHODS: Blood samples from 125 patients with primary adenocarcinoma of the 
      mid-low rectum who received 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy and external beam 
      radiotherapy (median dose 48.4 Gy), 125 patients (women n=45, men n=80; median 
      age 60 years, range 31-79 years) were genotyped. Response to preoperative 
      treatment was evaluated employing the Tumor Regression Grade criteria. On the 
      basis of the pathologic response, patients were classified as responders (TRG 
      1-2, n=48) and non-responders (TRG 3-5, n=74). Three patients were excluded 
      because of insufficient data. MAIN RESULTS: Among the polymorphic variants 
      examined, the MTHFR 677T-1298A haplotype was, upon univariate analysis, the only 
      variable found associated with tumor regression (P=0.004). Moreover, at 
      multivariate analysis, the MTHFR 677T-1298A haplotype was an independent 
      predictor of tumor regression. Patients not carrying the MTHFR 677T-1298A 
      haplotype (odds ratio 0.29, 95% confidence interval 0.13-0.64, P=0.002) displayed 
      a higher response rate than patients with the MTHFR 677T-1298A haplotype. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Unlike TS VNTR and SNP polymorphisms, MTHFR 677T-1298A haplotype in 
      genomic DNA has the potential to be a predictive marker of tumor response in 
      rectal cancer patients submitted to preoperative chemoradiotherapy.

TI  - Genomic copy number changes affecting the thymidylate synthase (TYMS) gene in 
      cancer: a model for patient classification to aid fluoropyrimidine therapy.
PG  - 9369-73
AB  - Thymidylate synthase (TS) is an important target for 5-fluorouracil (5FU)-based 
      therapy. The TS polymorphic 5'-untranslated region tandem repeat sequence is 
      under investigation to guide 5FU treatment, yet current protocols omit 
      consideration of copy number changes at the TS locus. We surveyed the TS tandem 
      repeat sequence and found copy number changes in gastrointestinal cancers. Ten of 
      12 informative cases had loss of heterozygosity (LOH), whereas two others and an 
      additional cell line had a novel TS genotype, allelic imbalance at the TS locus 
      due to polysomy. Experimentally, we studied a diploid colorectal cancer line 
      heterozygous at TS to mimic three common TS genotypes of cancers. Using genetic 
      engineering, we deleted the short tandem repeat (two repeats) allele and retained 
      the long (three repeats) allele to produce artificial LOH at the TS gene; the 
      TS(+/-) line had a reduced TS protein expression and was hypersensitive to 5FU 
      and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine in vitro as compared with syngeneic control lines. 
      We linked this sensitivity directly to the reduced TS expression by introducing 
      exogenous TS cDNA expression into the TS(+/-) line (i.e., increased TS copies). 
      Our model predicts that the 5FU sensitivity of a tumor is modified by aneuploidy 
      producing copy number changes of TS alleles by one or more of the following: LOH, 
      amplification, and, as presented here, copy number changes due to polysomy. The 
      data suggest that TS copy number in a patient's tumor may be a dominating 
      variable affecting 5FU responsiveness.

TI  - The thymidylate synthase tandem repeat promoter polymorphism: A predictor for 
      tumor-related survival in neoadjuvant treated locally advanced gastric cancer.
PG  - 2885-94
AB  - We evaluated DNA polymorphisms in the thymidylate synthase (TS) and 
      5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) genes for an association with 
      response and survival in locally advanced gastric cancer treated with 5-FU based 
      preoperative chemotherapy (CTx). DNA of 238 patients (CTx-group: total n = 135, 
      completely resected (R0) n = 102; without CTx: R0 n = 103) was isolated from 
      blood or from nontumorous tissues. In the CTx-group, genotyping of the tandem 
      repeat and the G/C polymorphism in the triple repeat in the promoter region of 
      the TS gene and of the C677T polymorphism of the MTHFR gene was performed. None 
      of the TS or MTHFR genotypes were associated with histopathological response and 
      only the TS tandem repeat polymorphism was significantly related to survival (all 
      patients n = 135, p = 0.002; R0 resected patients n = 102, p = 0.007; log-rank 
      test). Multivariate analysis revealed ypN (p < 0.001) and the TS tandem repeat 
      polymorphism as independent prognostic factors in the CTx-R0-group (p = 0.003). 
      Analyzing the prognostic significance of the TS polymorphisms in the R0-group 
      without CTx, TS genotypes were not significantly associated with survival. 
      Comparing survival between R0 patients with and without CTx in the respective TS 
      genotype groups of the tandem repeat polymorphism, a significant survival benefit 
      for the patients with CTx was found for the 2rpt/2rpt (n = 49; p = 0.002) and 
      2rpt/3rpt genotypes (n = 99; p = 0.004), but not for the 3rpt/3rpt genotype (n = 
      57; p = 0.93). Patients' survival after CTx was associated with the TS tandem 
      repeat polymorphism. CTx did not improve survival of patients with the 3rpt/3rpt 
      genotype. Thus, a different therapy might be more appropriate for these patients.

TI  - Orotate phosphoribosyltransferase gene polymorphism predicts toxicity in patients 
      treated with bolus 5-fluorouracil regimen.
PG  - 3928-34
AB  - PURPOSE: We investigated whether the determination of orotate 
      phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT) and thymidylate synthase (TYMS) polymorphisms 
      could predict the toxicity of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in colorectal cancer 
      patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The determination of OPRT and TYMS genotypes were 
      done in genomic DNA extracted from blood by PCR amplification in 69 patients 
      treated with bolus 5-FU as adjuvant chemotherapy. Associations between these 
      polymorphisms and toxicity were evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS: The Ala 
      allele in OPRT Gly213Ala polymorphism and the two tandem repeats (2R) in TYMS 
      promoter polymorphism were associated with grade 3 to 4 neutropenia and diarrhea. 
      The multivariate logistic regression models revealed that only TYMS promoter 
      polymorphism had an independent value to predict grade 3 to 4 neutropenia [odds 
      ratio, 19.2 for patients with the 2R allele compared with patients with 
      homozygous with the three repeat (3R) alleles], whereas both OPRT and TYMS 
      promoter polymorphisms were independent predictive factors for grade 3 to 4 
      diarrhea (odds ratio, 13.3 for patients with the Ala allele compared with 
      patients in the Gly/Gly genotype and 11.1 for patients with the 2R allele 
      compared with patients in the 3R/3R genotype). A significant difference was 
      observed in the time to onset of severe toxicity, defined as grade 4 neutropenia 
      and/or grade 3 to 4 gastrointestinal toxicities according to OPRT and TYMS 
      promoter polymorphisms. CONCLUSION: OPRT Gly213Ala polymorphism seems to be a 
      useful marker for predicting toxicity to bolus 5-FU chemotherapy. Prospective 
      translational treatment trials including larger number of patients are needed to 
      confirm our results.

TI  - Thymidylate synthase expression pattern, expression level and single nucleotide 
      polymorphism are predictors for disease-free survival in patients of colorectal 
      cancer treated with 5-fluorouracil.
PG  - 1303-10
AB  - Several variables associated to thymidylate synthase (TS), the biological target 
      of 5-fluorouracil (5FU) have been studied for their possible role as predictors 
      of the clinical outcome and response to chemotherapy in colorectal cancer (CRC) 
      patients. The level of protein expression and the number of variable 
      tandem-repeats of a 28-bp sequence within the gene promoter have been proposed as 
      predictive and/or prognostic factors with variable agreement, while consensus 
      seems to be achieved with respect to the value of a single nucleotide 
      polymorphism (SNP) described within this same region. More recently, an 
      association between TS expression pattern and survival has been disclosed. 
      Paraffin-embedded sections from 140 CRC patients were analyzed by 
      immuno-histochemistry (Mab TS106) for TS levels and expression pattern. Also, 
      VNTR and SNP were determined by polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) and 
      restriction-length-fragment polymorphism (RFLP) in 123 and 112 patients, 
      respectively. Cytoplasmic expression pattern tended to be associated to C SNP 
      (p=0.06). Low TS expression levels, cytoplasmic expression pattern and C SNP 
      arose as variables associated to longer progression-free survival (PFS) in 
      patients treated with 5FU. Accordingly, patients having at least two favourable 
      or unfavourable variables were classified respectively as 'low risk' and 'high 
      risk', the former showing significantly longer PFS (p=0.0299). The possibility 
      for designing a selection method for subsequent therapies is suggested on the 
      basis of a probable combined effect of the above mentioned parameters but further 
      studies in larger populations are needed to confirm these results.

TI  - Uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 promoter polymorphism predicts 
      the risk of gastrointestinal toxicity and fatigue induced by irinotecan-based 
      chemotherapy.
PG  - 1007-16
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the current Phase II study, the authors evaluated the association 
      between genomic polymorphic variants in uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl 
      transferase (UGT1A1), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), and 
      thymidylate synthase (TS) genes, and the incidence of the adverse effects of 
      irinotecan and raltitrexed in previously heavily treated patients with metastatic 
      colorectal carcinoma. METHODS: Fifty-six patients received irinotecan (at a dose 
      of 80 mg/m(2) on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 every 5 wks), combined with raltitrexed 
      (at a dose of 3 mg/m(2) every 3 wks). Genotyping for the MTHFR C677T 
      polymorphism, the TATA box region in the UGT1A1 promoter, and tandem repeats in 
      the TS promoter was performed on genomic DNA extracted from blood. Nineteen 
      variables related to patient, disease, and treatment characteristics, together 
      with genotypes, were analyzed using a binary logistic regression model with 
      stepwise selection to evaluate their correlation with adverse reactions. RESULTS: 
      Toxicities (determined according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity 
      Criteria) were evaluated in 169 cycles. Grade 3/4 neutropenia was reported to 
      occur in 2% of cycles, Grade 2-4 nausea was reported to occur in 19% of cycles, 
      Grade 2-4 emesis was reported to occur in 9% of cycles, Grade 2-4 diarrhea was 
      reported to occur in 20% of cycles, Grade 2/3 fatigue was reported to occur in 
      11% of cycles, and Grade 3/4 hepatic toxicity was reported to occur in 7% of 
      cycles. Homozygosis for six TA repeats in the promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene 
      was found to be the main predictive factor for diarrhea (P < 0.00005), emesis (P 
      = 0.0001), and fatigue (P = 0.007). Homozygosis for two tandem repeats in the TS 
      promoter was found to be predictive of a reduced incidence of fatigue (P = 
      0.044). MTHFR C677T polymorphism was not found to be associated with any adverse 
      reaction. CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, UGT1A1 promoter polymorphism was 
      found to be predictive of the risk of diarrhea, emesis, and fatigue caused by 
      chemotherapy with irinotecan and raltitrexed. Screening for UGT1A1 promoter 
      polymorphism may be clinically useful for identifying patients at a higher risk 
      of developing a severe or potentially life-threatening toxicity after 
      irinotecan-based chemotherapy.

TI  - Prognostic significance of the polymorphisms in thymidylate synthase and 
      methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene in lung cancer.
PG  - 4455-61
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thymidylate synthase (TS) and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 
      (MTHFR) play important roles in folate metabolism. Previous studies have 
      suggested that TS expression is a prognostic factor in non-small cell lung cancer 
      (NSCLC). The TS gene has a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) and single 
      nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 5'-untranslated region, which are associated 
      with TS expression. This association suggests that the TS polymorphism is a novel 
      prognostic factor in NSCLC. In the present study, multiple genetic polymorphisms, 
      TS VNTR, TS SNP and MTHFR C677T, were analyzed in NSCLC and compared with 
      clinicopathological features and patients' prognoses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Genomic DNA was isolated from 294 surgically resected NSCLC tissues. The 
      genotypes were determined by PCR and PCR-RFLP. The TS VNTR and SNP were combined, 
      followed by functional stratification of H/H (3G/3G), H/L (2R/3G, 3G/3C) and L/L 
      (2R/2R, 2R/3C, 3C/3C). Patients' prognoses were compared with TS and/or MTHFR 
      genotype groups. TS was divided into the H- (H/H, H/L) and L-groups (L/L) 
      according to functional stratification and MTHFR C677T was divided into C- (C/C) 
      and T-groups (C/T, T/T). RESULTS: TS VNTR, the SNP and the TS functional type, 
      along with MTHFR C677T, showed no significant association with 
      clinicopathological factors. There were no differences in prognosis between each 
      genotype or functional group when the TS and MTHFR groups were considered 
      separately. However, we found a unique association between prognosis and the TS 
      functional group in stage I NSCLC, taking both TS and MTHFR groups into 
      consideration. The patients in the TS L-group survived longer than those in the 
      H-group when limited to stage I and MTHFR C-group (p = 0.086). This relationship 
      between the TS genotype group and prognosis was statistically significant in the 
      subgroup of stage IB and MTHFR C-group (p = 0.030). In contrast, the patients in 
      the TS H-group survived longer than those in the L-group when limited to stage I 
      and MTHFR T-group (p = 0.052). CONCLUSION: The TS and MTHFR genotypes can be 
      prognostic factors in NSCLC, where gene-gene interactions between the genotypes 
      may occur. Further validation and investigation of the involvement of genotypes 
      of folate metabolizing enzymes in the prognosis of NSCLC patients are required.

TI  - The prognostic significance of genetic polymorphisms (Methylenetetrahydrofolate 
      Reductase C677T, Methionine Synthase A2756G, Thymidilate Synthase tandem repeat 
      polymorphism) in multimodally treated oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
PG  - 203-7
AB  - The present study retrospectively examined the correlation between the outcome of 
      patients with locally advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (cT3-4 cN0-1 
      cM0) after multimodal treatment (radiochemotherapy+/-surgical resection), and the 
      presence of genetic polymorphisms in genes involved in folate metabolism. In 
      total, 68 patients who took part in a prospective multicentric trial received 
      5-fluorouracil (FU)-based radiochemotherapy, optionally followed by surgery. DNA 
      was extracted from pretherapeutic tumour biopsies and was subsequently genotyped 
      for common genetic polymorphisms of three genes (MTHFR C677T, MTR A2756G, TS 
      tandem repeat polymorphism) involved in folate metabolism and potentially in 
      sensitivity to 5-FU-based chemotherapy. The genotypes were correlated with tumour 
      response to polychemotherapy, radiochemotherapy and with overall survival. 
      Tumours with the MTR wild-type genotype (2756AA) showed a median survival time of 
      16 months, whereas tumours with an MTR variant genotype (2756AG/2756GG) showed a 
      median survival time of 42 months (P=0.0463). No prognostic impact could be 
      verified for the genotypes of the MTHFR genes and the TS gene. Among tumours 
      treated with radiochemotherapy and subsequent resection, MTR variant genotype 
      showed higher histopathological response rate than tumours with MTR wild-type 
      genotype (P=0.0442). In contrast, no significant relationship between clinically 
      determined tumour regression after polychemotherapy and polymorphisms of the 
      three genes under analysis was observed. In conclusion, pretherapeutic 
      determination of the MTR A2756G polymorphism may predict survival of multimodally 
      treated oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas. Determination of MTHFR C677T and TS 
      tandem repeat polymorphism has no predictive value.

TI  - Genetic polymorphisms in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and thymidylate 
      synthase and risk of pancreatic cancer.
PG  - 743-51
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Human pancreatic cancer might be associated with folate 
      deficiency and impaired metabolism. We tested this hypothesis by examining the 
      contribution of functional polymorphisms in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 
      (MTHFR) and thymidylate synthase (TS) to risk of cancer. METHODS: DNA from 163 
      pancreatic cancer patients and 337 control subjects was genotyped for MTHFR (677C 
      > T and 1298A > C) and TS (5'-untranslated region tandem repeat and G/C). 
      Association with risk of pancreatic cancer was estimated by logistic regression. 
      All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: We observed an increased risk of 
      pancreatic cancer associated with the MTHFR 677CT (odds ratio [OR], 2.60; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 1.61-4.29; P = .0005) or 677TT (OR, 5.12; 95% CI, 
      2.94-9.10; P < .0001) genotype compared with the MTHFR CC genotype. An increased 
      risk of pancreatic cancer was also associated with the TS 3Rc/3Rc genotype (OR, 
      2.19, 95% CI, 1.13-4.31; P = .022) compared with the TS 3Rg/3Rg genotype. Joint 
      effect between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and smoking or drinking increased risk of 
      pancreatic cancer in a super-multiplicative manner. The ORs for smoking, the 
      polymorphism, and both factors combined were 0.70 (95% CI, 0.30-1.63), 2.17 (95% 
      CI, 1.17-4.21), and 3.10 (95% CI, 1.54-6.51), respectively. This joint effect was 
      much stronger in heavy smokers (OR, 6.69; 95% CI, 3.39-13.63; P < .0001). The ORs 
      for drinking, the polymorphism, and both factors combined were 0.98 (95% CI, 
      0.40-2.30), 2.81 (95% CI, 1.65-4.98), and 4.39 (95% CI, 2.25-8.78), respectively. 
      CONCLUSION: The MTHFR and TS polymorphisms are genetic determinants for 
      developing pancreatic cancer.

TI  - Relationships between promoter polymorphisms in the thymidylate synthase gene and 
      mRNA levels in colorectal cancers.
PG  - 2176-83
AB  - Thymidylate synthase (TS) intratumoural expression may be a prognostic marker and 
      predict outcome of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy in colorectal cancer 
      patients. The TS gene promoter enhancer region contains two different 
      polymorphisms which can influence TS mRNA transcriptional and translational 
      efficiency: a polymorphic tandem repeat sequence (2 or 3 repeats; 2R and 3R) and 
      a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), G > C, within the second repeat of the 3R 
      alleles. We studied the relationship between tumoural TS mRNA expression levels 
      and TS gene polymorphisms in the colonic mucosa of 48 colorectal cancer patients. 
      The 3R/3R genotype was characterised by higher TS mRNA levels in the tumour than 
      the 2R/2R-2R/3R genotypes (P = 0.071). Regarding the relationship with the SNP 
      polymorphism, a statistically significant difference in TS gene expression 
      between the 3RG/3RG genotype and 2R/2R-2R/3RC-2R/3RG genotype subset was observed 
      (P = 0.017). No statistically significant correlation was observed between 
      experimental data and baseline clinical-pathological characteristics as well as 
      clinical outcome in the relatively small patient series investigated. This is the 
      first study reporting an association between the TS intra-repeat SNP and gene 
      expression levels in colorectal cancer patients. These results suggest that in 
      3R/3R patients, the G > C polymorphism may be an important factor in determining 
      TS mRNA expression levels, and warrant further investigation of the role of TS 
      promoter polymorphisms as predictors of sensitivity to 5-FU-based chemotherapy in 
      larger case series.

TI  - Prognostic role of thymidylate synthase polymorphisms in gastric cancer patients 
      treated with surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy.
PG  - 3778-83
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the prognostic role of thymidylate synthase (TS) 
      polymorphisms in gastric cancer patients treated with radical surgery and 
      fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Ninety gastric 
      cancer cases were identified among 187 patients previously enrolled in 
      prospective case-control studies for disease susceptibility. Patients were 
      genotyped for a G/C nucleotide change within a triple 28 bp variable number of 
      tandem repeat sequence in the TS 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) and a 6 bp 
      deletion in the TS 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR). According to available 
      functional data, patients with 5'-UTR 2R/2R, 2R/3C, 3C/3C genotypes were 
      classified as low TS producers (5'-UTRlow) and patients with 5'-UTR 3G/3G, 3G/3C, 
      2R/3G genotypes as high TS producers (5'UTRhigh). Patients with 3'-UTR del6/del6 
      and del6/ins6 genotypes were classified as low TS producers (3'-UTRlow) and 
      patients with 3'-UTR ins6/ins6 genotype as high TS producers (3'-UTRhigh). The 
      prognostic analysis was based on 5'-UTR/3'-UTR combined genotypes. RESULTS: Ten 
      patients (11%) were 5'-UTRhigh/3'-UTRhigh, 36 patients were 5'-UTRhigh/3'-UTRlow, 
      19 patients were 5'-UTRlow/3'-UTRhigh, and 25 patients were 5'-UTRlow/3'-UTRlow. 
      5'-UTRlow/3'-UTRlow patients showed the best outcome and the threshold of 
      statistical significance was achieved in the comparison of disease-free survival 
      and overall survival with 5'-UTRhigh/3'-UTRlow patients and 5'-UTRhigh/3'-UTRhigh 
      patients. The presence of at least one high TS expression genotype showed 
      independent adverse prognostic role in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      prognostic role of TS polymorphisms in gastric cancer deserves further 
      investigation because the adverse effect of high TS expression genotypes may be a 
      relevant information to improve adjuvant chemotherapeutic strategies.

TI  - Significant increase in risk of gastroesophageal cancer is associated with 
      interaction between promoter polymorphisms in thymidylate synthase and serum 
      folate status.
PG  - 1430-5
AB  - Thymidylate synthase (TS) catalyzes the 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate-mediated 
      conversion of deoxyuridine monophosphate to deoxythymydine monophosphate, a 
      nucleotide required for DNA synthesis and repair. The impaired TS expression has 
      been shown to be related to 28 bp tandem repeats and a G-->C SNP in the 5'-UTR of 
      TS. Folate deficiency has been demonstrated to play a role in gastroesophageal 
      carcinogenesis. This case-control study was to examine the hypothesis that the TS 
      polymorphisms, alone or in combination with serum folate status, may confer 
      susceptibility of the hosts to gastroesophageal cancer. We analyzed TS genotype 
      and serum folate concentration in 324 patients with esophageal squamous cell 
      carcinoma (ESCC), 231 patients with gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) and 492 
      controls. It was found that compared with the normal expression TS genotype, the 
      low expression TS genotype alone was significantly associated with increased risk 
      of ESCC [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.47; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-2.10] 
      but not GCA (OR=0.98, 95% CI=0.68-1.40). More importantly, a significant 
      interaction between the TS polymorphisms and serum folate status in risk of ESCC 
      and GCA was observed. Among subjects with low serum folate concentration (<3 
      ng/ml), the ORs of ESCC and GCA for the low expression genotype were 22.63 (95% 
      CI=10.44-49.05) and 4.08 (95% CI=1.94-8.59), which were greater than respective 
      9.97 (95% CI=5.67-17.53) and 1.88 (95% CI=1.18-3.24) for the normal expression 
      genotype (P=0.002 and 0.029). These results suggest an important role for folate 
      deficiency and impaired TS activity in the etiology of ESCC and GCA.

TI  - Thymidylate synthase gene polymorphism as a prognostic factor for colon cancer.
PG  - 336-42
AB  - The human thymidylate synthase (TS) gene promoter is polymorphic, having either 
      double or triple tandem repeats of a 28-base-pair (bp) sequence. Here, we 
      determined the significance of this polymorphism in predicting the clinical 
      outcomes for patients with colon cancer. We reviewed 121 consecutive patients 
      with stage II or III colon cancer who underwent a curative resection. After DNA 
      extraction from paraffin-embedded tissues, the promoter region of the TS gene was 
      amplified by polymerase chain reaction. In addition to the conventional 
      prognostic factors, patient survivals were compared with regard to the pattern of 
      TS polymorphism. Sixty-eight subjects were homozygotes for the triple-repeat 
      variant (250 bp, group A), and 53 subjects (group B) were either homozygotes for 
      the double-repeat variant (220 bp) or heterozygotes (220 and 250 bp). We found a 
      significant difference between groups A and B in survival (53% versus 80%, 
      P=0.0481). The difference was particularly significant in the patients with stage 
      III disease (41% versus 77%, P=0.0414). Tumor stage and the TS polymorphism were 
      identified as significant prognostic factors by multivariate analysis. We found 
      the TS polymorphism to be a significant and independent prognostic factor for 
      colon cancer.

TI  - Genetic heterogeneity of variable number tandem repeats in thymidylate synthase 
      gene in colorectal cancer patients.
PG  - 332-6
AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze the genetic variability in a variable number of tandem 
      repeats (VNTR) in the thymidylate synthase (TS) enhancer promoter region and 
      assess the influence of functional alterations in mismatch repair genes by 
      analyzing constitutional and tumoral DNA from patients with colorectal 
      adenocarcinoma with a high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) or microsatellite 
      stability (MSS) status. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients who underwent surgery for 
      colorectal adenocarcinoma were selected from the colorectal database of our 
      institute and, on the basis of MSI status, assigned to a study group and a 
      control group: group A, MSI-H; group B, MSS. Microsatellite status was 
      investigated using the Bethesda recommended panel (BAT-26, BAT-25, D2S123, 
      D5S346, D17S250). In MSI-H patients an additional analysis was made of the 
      microsatellite loci D18S61 and D18S58, both mapping in the region containing the 
      TS gene (18p11.2-11.32). Based on the number of altered microsatellites (> or = 
      2, 1, or 0), tumors were considered as having high (MSI-H) or low (MSI-L) 
      instability or microsatellite stability (MSS), respectively. Genotyping for 
      thymidylate synthase promoter polymorphism was carried out on constitutional and 
      tumor DNA of each patient by PCR amplification of the polymorphic region. 
      RESULTS: MSI-H was found in 55 patients (group A) and MSS in 50 patients (group 
      B). In none of the MSI-H patients was microsatellite instability found in the 
      additional D18S61 and D18S58 loci. In five group A and ten group B cases the 
      analysis was not performed because constitutional DNA and/or tumoral DNA were not 
      amplifiable. Homozygotes for the triple repeat variant (3R/3R) displayed only the 
      large PCR product, homozygotes for the double repeat variant (2R/2R) displayed 
      only the smaller PCR product, while heterozygotes (2R/3R) displayed both the 
      larger and smaller PCR products. In 3/50 (6%) group A patients and 5/40 (12%) 
      group B patients repeat variations were found in tumoral DNA. CONCLUSION: Our 
      findings demonstrate that there is genetic homogeneity between constitutional and 
      tumoral DNA but do not support the hypothesis that mismatch repair genes are 
      involved in VNTR recombinant events in TS gene variability.

TI  - Case-control analysis of thymidylate synthase polymorphisms and risk of lung 
      cancer.
PG  - 649-56
AB  - Although tobacco smoking is the primary risk factor for lung cancer, low dietary 
      folate intake and suboptimal DNA repair capacity also contribute to lung cancer 
      risk. Thymidylate synthase (TYMS) is involved in the metabolism of folate and the 
      provision of nucleotides needed for DNA synthesis and repair. Thus, a variation 
      in TYMS functions likely plays a role in the etiology of lung cancer. The TYMS 
      gene has a tandem repeat polymorphism (two or three 28 bp) in the TYMS enhancer 
      region (TSER) and a 6 bp deletion/insertion polymorphism in the TS 
      3'-untranslated region (TS3'UTR or 1494del6). We investigated the frequencies of 
      these two polymorphisms in a hospital-based case-control study of 1055 lung 
      cancer patients and 1140 cancer-free controls in a non-Hispanic white population 
      and genotyped for these two polymorphisms. We found that the TS3'UTR, but not the 
      TSER, variant was associated with the risk of lung cancer. Compared with 
      homozygotes for the TS3'UTR 6 bp deletion (0bp/0bp), the 6bp/0bp+6bp/6bp 
      genotypes were associated with a significantly increased risk of lung cancer 
      [odds ratio (OR) = 1.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.12-2.06]. In 
      stratification analysis the risk associated with the 0bp/6bp+6bp/6bp genotype was 
      more pronounced in subjects who were >55 years old (OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 
      1.10-2.23), males (OR = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.22-2.89), current (OR = 2.04, 95% CI = 
      1.26-3.29) and heavy smokers (OR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.10-2.70) and current drinkers 
      (OR = 3.17, 95% CI = 1.78-5.64).Furthermore, significant gene-dietary 
      interactions were found between TS3'UTR and alcohol consumption and between TSER 
      and vitamin B(12) intake. In conclusion, the polymorphisms of TYMS are likely to 
      contribute to the risk of lung cancer in non-Hispanic whites and interact with 
      dietary factors in lung cancer development.

TI  - Thymidylate synthase polymorphism and microsatellite instability: association in 
      colorectal cancer.
PG  - 1377-9
AB  - 5-Fluorouracil (5FU) is the main drug used for the treatment of colorectal cancer 
      (CRC) and Thymidilate Synthase (TS) is its target enzyme. TS gene has regulatory 
      tandemly repeated sequences in its 5' and 3'untraslated region (5'-3' UTR). CRC 
      often shows a kind of genomic instability called Microsatellite Instability (MSI) 
      that is associated with TS levels and survival. Our data show that the genotype 
      2R/2R (homozygosity for 2 tandem repeat sequences in the 5'UTR) is more 
      frequently associated with MSI+ and lower TS levels. More over we did not find 
      any significant association between the 2R/3R (heterozygosity for 2 and 3 tandem 
      repeat sequences in the 5'UTR) and 3R/3R (homozygosity for 3 tandem repeat 
      sequences in the 5' UTR) genotypes with the MSI+ and MSI-, while these genotypes 
      were associated with a higher TS expression. As a consequence we can hypothesise 
      that patients bearing CRC with the MSI+, the 2R/2R genotype and with low TS 
      levels could have a better prognosis and they could not be drug resistant.

TI  - Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthase polymorphisms are 
      not associated with breast cancer risk or phenotype.
PG  - 3215-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aberrations in folate metabolism contribute to the risk of cancer via 
      effects on the synthesis, methylation and repair of DNA. Functional genetic 
      variants in the methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and thymidylate 
      synthase (TS) genes may be risk factors for breast cancer because of their 
      central roles in cellular folate metabolism. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The MTHFR 
      C677T and TS tandem repeat polymorphisms were investigated in a case-control 
      study of 339 women with breast cancer for possible associations with the risk of 
      this disease, tumor phenotype and patient survival. RESULTS: The MTHFR and TS 
      polymorphisms were not associated with a significantly increased risk of breast 
      cancer. No associations were observed with any pathological or molecular feature 
      and neither polymorphism was associated with survival from this disease. 
      CONCLUSION: The common MTHFR C677T and TS enhancer region polymorphisms were not 
      risk factors for breast cancer in this patient cohort nor were they associated 
      with phenotypic features or with prognosis.

TI  - Polyglutamation of methotrexate with common polymorphisms in reduced folate 
      carrier, aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase, and 
      thymidylate synthase are associated with methotrexate effects in rheumatoid 
      arthritis.
PG  - 2766-74
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Methotrexate (MTX) enters cells through the reduced folate carrier 
      (RFC-1) and exerts part of its effects through polyglutamation to MTX 
      polyglutamates (MTXPGs) and inhibition of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 
      ribonucleotide transformylase (ATIC) and thymidylate synthase (TS). We 
      investigated the contribution of common genetic polymorphisms in RFC-1 (G80A), 
      ATIC (C347G), and TS (28-bp tandem repeats located in the TS enhancer region 
      [TSER*2/*3]) and of MTXPGs to the effect of MTX in patients with rheumatoid 
      arthritis. METHODS: The study was cross-sectional. All patients received MTX for 
      at least 3 months. The numbers of tender and swollen joints, the Visual Analog 
      Scale (VAS) scores for the physician's global assessment of disease activity, and 
      the modified Health Assessment Questionnaire scores were collected. Using the VAS 
      score for the physician's assessment of patient's response to MTX, the population 
      of patients was dichotomized into responders to MTX (VAS score < or =2 cm) and 
      nonresponders to MTX (VAS score >2 cm). A pharmacogenetic index was calculated as 
      the sum of homozygous variant genotypes (RFC-1 AA + ATIC 347GG + TSER *2/*2) 
      carried by the patients. MTXPG concentrations were measured in red blood cells 
      (RBCs) by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The dose of MTX was 
      not associated with the effects of MTX (P > 0.05). In contrast, increased RBC 
      long-chain MTXPG concentrations (median 40 nmoles/liter; range <5-131 
      nmoles/liter) and an increased pharmacogenetic index were associated with a lower 
      number of tender and swollen joints (P < 0.05) and a lower score for the 
      physician's global assessment of disease activity (P < or = 0.001). Patients with 
      RBC MTXPG levels of >60 nmoles/liter and carriers of a homozygous variant 
      genotype were 14.0-fold (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 3.6-53.8) and 3.7-fold 
      (95% CI 1.7-9.1), respectively, more likely to have a good response to MTX (P <or 
      = 0.01). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that measuring RBC MTXPG levels and/or 
      the common polymorphisms in the folate-purine-pyrimidine pathway may help in 
      monitoring MTX therapy.

TI  - Single nucleotide polymorphism in the 5' tandem repeat sequences of thymidylate 
      synthase gene predicts for response to fluorouracil-based chemotherapy in 
      advanced colorectal cancer patients.
PG  - 733-7
AB  - Thymidylate synthase (TS) is the primary target of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). A VNTR 
      polymorphism in the TS promoter region is associated with the efficacy of 
      5-FU-based chemotherapy in colorectal cancer. A common G>C SNP at the 12th 
      nucleotide of the second repeat in the TS*3 alleles has been recently described. 
      The combination of SNP and VNTR allows the definition of 3 TS alleles: *2, *3G 
      and *3C. The aim of our study was to evaluate the predictive value of clinical 
      response and survival of these new defined TS alleles. TS genotypes of 89 
      patients diagnosed with metastatic colorectal cancer and undergoing 5-FU-based 
      chemotherapy were carried out. The clinical outcome was evaluated according to 
      the genotype (high expression genotype: *2R/*3G; *3C/*3G; *3G/*3G; and low 
      expression genotype: *2R/*2R; *2R/*3C; *3C/*3C. A higher overall response was 
      observed in the group of patients with a low expression genotype (p = 0.035). The 
      probability of achieving a clinical response of patients with a low 
      expression-related genotype was 2.9 higher than that of the other group (95% CI = 
      1.03-5.6, p = 0.04). The median time to progression was 12 months and 9 months in 
      the low and high expression groups, respectively (p = 0.07, log rank test). 
      Overall survival was significantly longer in the low expression group. In this 
      group the median OS was not achieved at 50 months of follow-up in contrast to the 
      20 months observed in the high expression group (p = 0.03). TS genotype was an 
      independent predictor of progression-free and overall survival in the Cox 
      regression models after adjustment to the other clinical variables. The selection 
      of patients who are likely to respond to 5-FU therapy may be considerably 
      improved if the TS genotype were to include both the VNTR and the SNP located 
      within the promoter region of the gene.

TI  - Association of the thymidylate synthase polymorphisms with esophageal squamous 
      cell carcinoma and gastric cardiac adenocarcinoma.
PG  - 2479-85
AB  - Polymorphisms in the untranslated regions (UTRs) of the thymidylate synthase (TS) 
      gene, which may modulate TS transcription and expression, have been associated 
      with susceptibility and prognosis of several tumors. However, their effects on 
      the development and clinical staging of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) 
      and gastric cardiac adenocarcinoma (GCA) have not been assessed so far. In this 
      study, the 28-bp tandem repeat and the G/C single nucleotide polymorphism in the 
      TS 5'UTR, the 6-bp deletion (6 bp-) polymorphism in the TS 3'UTR, were genotyped 
      in 465 cancer patients (232 ESCC, 233 GCA) and 348 control subjects in North 
      China. The genotype and allelotype distribution of the TS variants in ESCC, GCA 
      patients and controls did not show significant difference. However, the frequency 
      of the 6 bp-/2R haplotype in ESCC and GCA patients was marginally or 
      significantly lower than that in controls (P = 0.05 and 0.006, respectively). 
      Thus, the 6 bp-/2R significantly reduced the risk to ESCC and GCA, compared with 
      the 6 bp-/3G haplotype [odds ratio (OR) = 0.61 and 0.48, 95% confidence interval 
      (CI) = 0.37-1.00 and 0.28-0.81, respectively]. In addition, the 6 bp+/3G 
      haplotype in ESCC patients was also significantly less common than in controls (P 
      = 0.002). Compared with the 6 bp-/3G haplotype, the 6 bp+/3G significantly 
      reduced the risk to ESCC (OR = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.14-0.67). Moreover, the TS 2R/3G 
      genotype frequency in ESCC patients with and without lymphatic metastasis was 
      significantly different (27.1 versus 4.9%, P < 0.001). Therefore, the 2R/3G 
      genotype had an approximately 11-fold increase in the risk of lymphatic 
      metastasis of ESCC, compared with the 3G/3G genotype (95% CI = 2.67-49.74). The 
      results suggested that the TS polymorphisms might be associated with the 
      susceptibility to ESCC and GCA, and the 2R/3G genotype might be a candidate 
      marker to predict the potential of lymphatic metastasis in ESCC.

TI  - A 6 bp polymorphism in the thymidylate synthase gene causes message instability 
      and is associated with decreased intratumoral TS mRNA levels.
PG  - 319-27
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A 6 bp deletion polymorphism in the thymidylate synthase (TS) gene was 
      investigated in order to determine its function. METHODS: A luciferase system was 
      used to investigate the function of the 6 bp/1494 polymorphism in vitro. A group 
      of 43 patients with colorectal carcinoma were evaluated for the 6 bp/1494 
      polymorphism and for intratumoral TS mRNA levels in vivo. RESULTS: The 3'UTR of 
      TS containing the +6 bp polymorphism resulted in an approximate 35% decrease in 
      luciferase activity and mRNA levels, while the TS-3'UTR bearing the -6 bp 
      deletion resulted in an approximate 70% decrease in luciferase activity and mRNA 
      levels. The TS-3'UTR construct containing the -6 bp/1494 deletion also had a 
      higher rate of message degradation compared to the +6 bp/1494 construct. 
      Individuals homozygous for the insertion (+6 bp/+6 bp) had significantly higher 
      TS mRNA levels compared to individuals that were homozygous for the deletion (-6 
      bp/-6 bp) (P < 0.007). We determined the frequency of the -6 bp/1494 deletion 
      polymorphism to be 41% in non-Hispanic whites, 26% in Hispanic whites, 52% in 
      African-Americans and 76% in Singapore Chinese. CONCLUSIONS: These results 
      suggest that the -6 bp/1494 deletion polymorphism in the 3'UTR of TS is 
      associated with decreased mRNA stability in vitro and lower intratumoral TS 
      expression in vivo. Further, the 6 bp/1494 polymorphism varies greatly within 
      different ethnic populations and is in linkage disequilibrium with the TS 5' 
      tandem repeat enhancer polymorphism. Taken together, these data suggest that the 
      6 bp/1494 polymorphism may be a useful screening tool in predicting TS mRNA 
      expression.

TI  - Identification and functional analysis of single nucleotide polymorphism in the 
      tandem repeat sequence of thymidylate synthase gene.
PG  - 6004-7
AB  - The variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) of thymidylate synthase (TS) gene, 
      mainly 2 repeat (2R) and 3 repeat (3R), is one of the genetic variations that can 
      potentially predict the effectiveness of 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy. In 
      this study we identified an additional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in 
      the VNTR of TS, followed by functional and clinical analysis of the SNP. 
      Two-hundred fifty eight tumor samples were obtained from patients with primary 
      colorectal adenocarcinoma. We observed three different patterns of 
      electrophoresis by analysis of the VNTR with 2R/3R heterozygote. The sequencing 
      results revealed a SNP, G/C polymorphism, within the 28-bp repeat component of TS 
      VNTR. Each polymorphic allele was assigned as 2G, 2C, 3G, or 3C according to the 
      combination of SNP and VNTR. Functional analysis showed that the plasmid 
      construct with 3G sequence had three to four times greater efficiency of 
      translation than other polymorphic sequences. 3R allele in colorectal cancer was 
      subdivided into around half by the SNP, indicating its commonness among Japanese. 
      TS genotypes of the patients with colorectal cancer were classified into high 
      expression type (2R/3G, 3C/3G, and 3G/3G) and low expression type (2R/2R, 2R/3C, 
      and 3C/3C). The patients who received oral fluoropyrimedines survived longer than 
      the patients with no treatment in the group of low expression type. No benefit of 
      oral fluoropyrimedines was observed in the group of high expression type. These 
      results suggest that the double polymorphism in the TS tandem repeat sequence, 
      the SNP and the VNTR, may provide a potential for more effective prediction of 
      the clinical outcome of 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy.

TI  - Polymorphisms in the thymidylate synthase and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 
      genes and sensitivity to the low-dose methotrexate therapy in patients with 
      rheumatoid arthritis.
PG  - 593-600
AB  - Methotrexate (MTX), widely used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 
      inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and folate-dependent enzymes. Thymidylate 
      synthase (TS) and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) are key enzymes in 
      the folate metabolism and both have been shown to be polymorphic affecting the 
      enzyme activity. To clarify the association between these genetic variations and 
      MTX-related toxicity and efficacy in the treatment of RA, a total of 167 Japanese 
      individuals with RA, including 52 and 63 patients treated with low-dose MTX with 
      or without adverse effects, respectively, and 52 patients without MTX 
      administration were analyzed. Among the 93 patients treated with MTX for >2 
      months, significantly more patients homozygous for the triple-repeat allele of 
      the polymorphism in the promoter region of the TYMS gene required higher dose of 
      MTX compared to those having at least a double-repeat allele (P=0.033). The 
      incidence of > or =50% improvement in the serum CRP level was significantly 
      higher in patients homozygous for the deletion allele of the polymorphism in the 
      3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the TYMS gene (P=0.0383). The allele frequency of 
      the insertion/deletion polymorphism in the TYMS 3'UTR in Japanese was 
      significantly different from that in Caucasians (P<0.0001), as was the 
      tandem-repeat polymorphism in its promoter region. On the other hand, MTHFR C677T 
      and A1298C polymorphisms showed no association with MTX-related toxicity or 
      efficacy. Our results suggest that the genotyping for the TYMS polymorphisms may 
      become a useful indicator in determining the appropriate dose of MTX in patients 
      with RA.

TI  - Associations between polymorphisms in the thymidylate synthase and serine 
      hydroxymethyltransferase genes and susceptibility to malignant lymphoma.
PG  - 159-66
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Polymorphisms in thymidylate synthase (TS) 28-bp 
      tandem repeats in the promoter region and in cytosolic serine 
      hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT1 C1420T) have been reported to modulate the risk 
      of adult acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). We examined the associations between 
      susceptibility to malignant lymphoma and these polymorphisms. DESIGN AND METHODS: 
      A hospital-based prevalent case-control study was conducted in Aichi Cancer 
      Center. One hundred and eight patients with histologically confirmed lymphoma and 
      494 control subjects without cancer were evaluated. RESULTS: In a risk estimation 
      of each genotype, those who harbored at least one TS 2 repeat (2R) allele had a 
      1.6-fold increase in the risk of malignant lymphoma (OR=1.63; 95%CI, 1.05-2.53, 
      p=0.030) when using those without the TS 2R allele as a reference. For the SHMT1 
      C1420T polymorphism, those harboring at least one T allele showed a 2.2-fold 
      decrease in risk (OR =0.46; 95% CI, 0.23-0.93, p=0.031). Moreover, combined 
      analysis of TS and SHMT1 polymorphisms revealed that the OR for lymphoma in 
      patients with SHMT1 1420 CC and the TS 2R allele, which might be expected to 
      provide the basis for the highest susceptibility, was 2.88 (95% CI, 1.26-6.58, 
      p=0.013). INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that genetic 
      traits involving low penetrance polymorphisms in folate-metabolizing genes may 
      modulate the risk of malignant lymphoma.

TI  - Functional polymorphism of the thymidylate synthase gene in colorectal cancer 
      accompanied by frequent loss of heterozygosity.
PG  - 1221-9
AB  - The thymidylate synthase (TS) gene has a polymorphic repeated sequence in its 
      5'-untranslated region. The repeat length is associated with TS protein 
      expression, which suggests that we may be able to predict the efficacy of 
      5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy from a patient's TS genotype determined 
      through analysis of normal tissue obtained non-invasively. However, it is not yet 
      elucidated whether the TS genotype is identical in tumor and normal tissue. In 
      this study, we investigated the TS genotype in 151 matched tumor and normal DNA 
      samples isolated from colorectal cancer and adjacent normal tissues by PCR 
      analysis. The results showed that TS genotypes are identical in normal and tumor 
      tissues of homozygous individuals, suggesting that the repeat sequence is stable 
      through carcinogenesis. However, in heterozygous samples, an imbalance between 
      the 2R and 3R alleles in the tumor DNA was frequently observed, suggesting loss 
      of heterozygosity (LOH) at the TS locus. Detailed LOH analysis revealed that 62% 
      (31 of 50) of 2R/3R-heterozygous samples had LOH. Frequent LOH at the TS locus 
      was confirmed by RT-PCR of TS mRNA and microsatellite analysis using the marker 
      D18S59, located on 18p11.3. There was no difference in the expressions of TS mRNA 
      and TS protein between LOH and non-LOH samples. However, when the heterozygous 
      genotype bearing LOH was subdivided according to the number of repeats, the 
      cancer tissue with 2R/loss genotype expressed a significantly lower level of TS 
      protein than did that with 3R/loss genotype. The results suggest that the 
      difference in TS genotype between tumor and normal tissue due to LOH should be 
      considered when the genotype is analyzed with normal tissue, such as peripheral 
      blood cells, because it is important for TS protein expression.

TI  - Association between the dopamine transporter gene and posttraumatic stress 
      disorder.
PG  - 903-7
AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic anxiety disorder that follows 
      exposure to extreme events. A large twin study of Vietnam veterans had 
      demonstrated a significant genetic contribution to chronic PTSD upon exposure to 
      combat.(1,2) The underlying genes, however, have not been described. Given 
      previous findings of abnormal dopamine (DA) function in PTSD, and given the 
      putative effect of dopamine neurotransmission in shaping the responses to stress 
      in animals, this study examined the association of the dopamine transporter (DAT) 
      SLC6A3 3' variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism with PTSD. The study 
      evaluated 102 chronic PTSD patients and 104 carefully-documented trauma survivors 
      (TS) who did not develop PTSD. Significant excess of 9 repeat allele was observed 
      among PTSD patients (43% vs 30.5% in TS controls; chi(2) = 6.3, df = 1, P = 
      0.012). An excess of 9 repeat homozygous genotype was also observed in PTSD 
      (20.43% in PTSD vs 9.47% in TS controls; chi(2) = 6.11, df = 2, P < 0.047). These 
      findings suggest that genetically determined changes in dopaminergic reactivity 
      may contribute to the occurrence of PTSD among trauma survivors.

TI  - Thymidylate synthase: a novel genetic determinant of plasma homocysteine and 
      folate levels.
PG  - 299-302
AB  - The thymidylate synthase gene ( TYMS or TS) encodes a tightly regulated enzyme 
      that catalyzes the conversion of deoxyuridylate to thymidylate, and contains a 
      tandem repeat polymorphism that affects expression of the enzyme. We have 
      investigated the relationship between TYMS genotype and plasma concentrations of 
      homocysteine and folate in a cohort of 505 Chinese from Singapore. TYMS 3/3 
      genotype was associated with reduced plasma folate and, among individuals with 
      low dietary folate intake, with elevated plasma homocysteine levels. These 
      associations were independent of the well-established methylenetetrahydrofolate 
      reductase ( MTHFR) C677T genotype effects on plasma folate and homocysteine 
      levels. Our results suggest that TYMS and MTHFR compete for limiting supplies of 
      folate required for the remethylation of homocysteine. These genetic determinants 
      of plasma folate and homocysteine levels may be useful in identifying individuals 
      at increased risk for cardiovascular disease.

TI  - Changes of cortical excitability of human motor cortex in spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 2. A study with paired transcranial magnetic stimulation.
PG  - 87-92
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate motor cortex excitability in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2). Cortical silent period (CSP), motor 
      thresholds, and intracortical inhibition and facilitation by paired transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation (TMS) were investigated in 18 SCA2 patients and in 20 
      controls. The mean CSP duration and motor threshold after TMS were significantly 
      increased in the patient group. Intracortical inhibition by paired TMS at short 
      interstimulus intervals (ISIs) showed no significant differences between patients 
      and controls; at longer ISIs, the expected facilitation of test responses, 
      observed in control subjects, resulted significantly less marked in SCA2 patients 
      at all the tested intervals. Our findings extend previous findings on cerebellar 
      dysfunctions of varying aetiologies by investigating intracortical excitability 
      in SCA2. In addition, this study demonstrates that the cortical excitability 
      involvement found in SCA2 is independent on the cytosine-adenine-guanine repeat 
      expansion. The neurophysiological alterations seen in our patients relate to the 
      worsening of general clinical condition. Thus, we might speculate that changes of 
      motor cortex excitability in SCA2 represent a slow neurodegenerative process 
      characterized by gradual loss of cerebellar neurons leading to an increasing 
      disturbance of the balance between inhibitory and excitatory circuits in the 
      motor system.

TI  - Thymidylate synthase gene polymorphism determines response and toxicity of 5-FU 
      chemotherapy.
PG  - 65-70
AB  - Thymidylate synthase (TS) catalyses the conversion of deoxy-uridylate to 
      deoxy-thymidylate and is essential for DNA synthesis. The human TS gene promoter 
      is polymorphic, having either double or triple tandem repeats of a 28-bp 
      sequence. Here we determined the significance of this polymorphism in humans and 
      its prediction for clinical outcome of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer 
      treated with 5-fluorouracil. The TS mRNA level was analyzed using RT-PCR. 
      Individuals homozygous for the triple repeat variant (L/L) had 3.6 times higher 
      TS mRNA levels compared to those homozygous for the double repeat variant (S/S) 
      in tumor tissue (P = 0.004). We tested 50 patients with disseminated colorectal 
      cancer who received 5-FU treatment to determine whether this TS polymorphism will 
      predict clinical outcome. We found individuals with S/S genotype had a response 
      rate of 50% (4/8) when compared to 9% (2/22) in those with L/L and 15% (3/20) in 
      those with S/L genotype (P = 0.041). Patients with L/L had less severe side 
      effects to 5-FU (P = 0.008). The data suggest that genotyping for the TS 
      polymorphism may have the potential to identify patients more likely to respond 
      to 5-FU based chemotherapy.

TI  - The Trypanosoma cruzi trans-sialidase is a T cell-independent B cell mitogen and 
      an inducer of non-specific Ig secretion.
PG  - 299-308
AB  - Polyclonal lymphocyte activation and hypergammaglobulinemia characterize the 
      acute phase of many parasitic diseases, including Chagas' disease, a debilitating 
      condition caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. Polyclonal lymphocyte activation 
      correlates with disease susceptibility inT. cruzi infection. Thus, identifying 
      factors that drive such reactivities should provide insight into mechanisms of 
      parasite evasion from host immunity and of disease pathogenesis. Sensitization of 
      mice with small doses of T. cruzi trans-sialidase (TS) turns the mice into highly 
      susceptible hosts to T. cruzi. In addition, TS heterologously expressed in 
      Leishmania major greatly enhances virulence of the parasite to mice. In attempt 
      to study the mechanism of TS-induced virulence, we found that TS and its 
      C-terminal long tandem repeat (LTR) are T-independent polyclonal activators for 
      mouse B cells. While B cells deficient/defective in L-6, CD40 or Toll-like 
      receptor-4 are similarly activated by TS as compared to wild-type cells, B cells 
      from Bruton's tyrosine kinase-defective X-linked immunodeficient mice are 
      remarkably insensitive to TS activation. TS-induced B cell activation in vitro is 
      accompanied by Ig secretion independent of T cells. Furthermore, administration 
      of TS into normal mice leads to non-specific Ig secretion that peaks 4-6 days 
      after injection. Thus TS, through its LTR, induces abnormal polyclonal B cell 
      activation and Ig secretion, which could explain in part its virulence-enhancing 
      activity.

TI  - Different lengths of a polymorphic repeat sequence in the thymidylate synthase 
      gene affect translational efficiency but not its gene expression.
PG  - 4096-101
AB  - PURPOSE: Thymidylate synthase (TS) is a target enzyme of 5-fluorouracil. 
      Recently, the TS gene has been shown to contain a polymorphic tandem repeat 
      sequence. The aim of this study was to determine whether differences in the 
      number of tandem repeats could affect gene expression or mRNA translation. 
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We quantified TS mRNA isolated from 130 colorectal cancer 
      tissues by real-time reverse transcription-PCR and TS protein in 92 available 
      samples by the fluoro-dUMP binding assay. These values were compared with TS 
      genotypes of the samples determined by a PCR assay. RESULTS: There was no 
      relation between TS genotype and mRNA expression level. On the other hand, cancer 
      tissues with the 3R/3R genotype had a significantly higher TS protein expression 
      level than did those with the 2R/3R genotype. These results suggest that the 
      efficiency of TS mRNA translation is responsible for the genotype-dependent 
      difference in TS protein expression. Further analysis using TS 5'-untranslated 
      region-luciferase reporter constructs showed that the RNA with the three-repeat 
      sequence was translated three to four times more efficiently than that with 
      two-repeat sequence. CONCLUSIONS: From the results of both in vitro and in vivo 
      study, we conclude that TS mRNA with a three-repeat sequence has greater 
      translation efficiency than that with the two-repeat sequence. The results 
      provide the rationale for comprehensive usage of TS genotyping with quantitation 
      of TS mRNA or TS protein to predict the patient's response to 
      5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy.

TI  - Children with atopic dermatitis who carry toxin-positive Staphylococcus aureus 
      strains have an expansion of blood CD5- B lymphocytes without an increase in 
      disease severity.
PG  - 184-9
AB  - Toxin-positive strains of Staphylococcus aureus (T + S. aureus) are present on 
      the skin of some but not all patients with atopic dermatitis. Many staphylococcal 
      toxins are superantigens, which can stimulate the immune response and thus may 
      potentially lead to the very high levels of IgE characteristic of this condition, 
      as well as exacerbating the clinical disease. The aim of this study was to 
      determine whether the presence of T + S. aureus on the skin of children with 
      atopic dermatitis was associated with in vivo evidence of a heightened humoral 
      immune response, higher IgE levels and more severe clinical disease. Toxin gene 
      expression in S. aureus isolated from the eczematous lesions of 28 children with 
      atopic dermatitis was assessed by PCR. Clinical and immune data were also 
      collected from this cohort. Thirteen of the 28 children (46%) were colonized with 
      T + S. aureus strains. The presence of T + S. aureus was associated with a 
      significant expansion in peripheral blood CD5- B cells (P = 0.01), and the more 
      toxin types identified the greater the B-cell expansion (P = 0.002). However, in 
      this cohort of children with atopic dermatitis, despite th in vivo expansion of B 
      cells in children harbouring T + S. aureus, there was no associated increase in 
      IgE levels or in clinical disease severity scores.

TI  - Polymorphism in the thymidylate synthase promoter enhancer region in colorectal 
      cancer.
PG  - 383-6
AB  - Thymidylate synthase (TS) is an important target for chemotherapy drugs such as 
      5-fluorouracil and raltitrexed. Over-expression of TS has been linked to 
      chemotherapy resistance. A polymorphic tandem repeat sequence in the 5' 
      untranslated region (5'UTR) of the human TS gene (TSER) has been shown to 
      influence TS expression. The presence of a triple tandem repeat (TSER*3) 
      increases in vitro TS expression compared to a double tandem repeat (TSER*2) and 
      is associated with higher in vivo tumor TS activity. The polymorphism of this 
      promoter enhancer region has not been extensively studied in patients with cancer 
      and may represent a possible mechanism of intrinsic resistance to TS inhibitors. 
      In this study, PCR analysis of genomic DNA from 121 patients with colorectal 
      cancer demonstrated 29% of patients were homozygous for TSER*3, 16% were 
      homozygous for TSER*2 and 55% were heterozygous. In 44/45 microdissected tumors 
      the TS enhancer genotype was identical between paired samples of colorectal tumor 
      and normal tissue. In 24 patients receiving a bolus/infusion 5-fluorouracil (5FU) 
      regimen for metastatic colorectal cancer, 22% of non-responders to chemotherapy 
      were homozygous for TSER*2 compared with 40% of responders. Median survival 
      dropped from 16 months for homozygous TSER*2 to 12 months for homozygous TSER*3. 
      This is consistent with previous studies where higher TS expression was 
      associated with poor response to TS inhibitors. Prospective analysis of the 
      influence of the TS polymorphism on patient outcome is warranted.

TI  - Polymorphic tandem repeats in the thymidylate synthase gene is associated with 
      its protein expression in human gastrointestinal cancers.
PG  - 3249-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thymidylate synthase (TS) is a target enzyme of 5-fluorouracil 
      (5-FU), and the TS gene has a polymorphic tandem repeated sequence in the 
      5'-untranslated region. We investigated the polymorphism on the repeat length of 
      the TS gene and its relation to the number of 5-fluoro-dUMP (FdUMP) binding sites 
      in human gastrointestinal cancers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy adenocarcinoma 
      samples were used. Twenty-one patients received UFT and 49 patients received no 
      treatment before surgery. Tandem repeat length of TS gene was determined by PCR 
      amplification of genomic DNA. The number of FdUMP binding sites were measured by 
      3H-FdUMP binding assay. RESULTS: Double- (2R) and triple-repeated (3R) sequences 
      of the TS gene were found in the cancer tissues. Three genotypes of TS were 
      found: 2R/2R (n = 3), 2R/3R (n = 16) and 3R/3R (n = 51). The free TS level for 
      the 3R/3R genotype was significantly higher than for the 2R/3R genotype in UFT 
      (+) group. Similar genotype-dependent difference of TS level was observed in UFT 
      (-) group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the link between TS genotype and TS 
      protein expression. This link might offer an advantage for selection of patients 
      to receive 5-FU-based chemotherapy.

TI  - DNA polymerase III proofreading mutants enhance the expansion and deletion of 
      triplet repeat sequences in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 2174-84
AB  - The influence of mutations in the 3' to 5' exonucleolytic proofreading 
      epsilon-subunit of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III on the genetic 
      instabilities of the CGG.CCG and the CTG.CAG repeats that cause human hereditary 
      neurological diseases was investigated. The dnaQ49(ts) and the mutD5 mutations 
      destabilize the CGG.CCG repeats. The distributions of the deletion products 
      indicate that slipped structures containing a small number of repeats in the loop 
      mediate the deletion process. The CTG.CAG repeats were destabilized by the 
      dnaQ49(ts) mutation by a process mediated by long hairpin loop structures (>/=5 
      repeats). The mutD5 mutator strain stabilized the (CTG.CAG)(175) tract, which 
      contained two interruptions. Since the mutD5 mutator strain has a saturated 
      mismatch repair system, the stabilization is probably an indirect effect of the 
      nonfunctional mismatch repair system in these strains. Shorter uninterrupted 
      tracts expand readily in the mutD5 strain, presumably due to the greater 
      stability of long CTG.CAG tracts (>100 repeats) in this strain. When parallel 
      studies were conducted in minimal medium, where the mutD5 strain is defective in 
      exonucleolytic proofreading but has a functional MMR system, both CTG.CAG and 
      CGG.CCG repeats were destabilized, showing that the proofreading activity is 
      essential for maintaining the integrity of TRS tracts. Thus, we conclude that the 
      expansion and deletion of triplet repeats are enhanced by mutations that reduce 
      the fidelity of replication.

TI  - Invasive phenotype of Trypanosoma cruzi restricted to a population expressing 
      trans-sialidase.
PG  - 3884-92
AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi expresses a developmentally regulated trans-sialidase 
      implicated in the pathogenesis of Chagas' disease. On inhabitation of the 
      extracellular milieu of cultured cells by infective trypomastigotes, the enzyme 
      is restricted to a small (20 to 30%) population of parasites. The biological 
      significance of trans-sialidase expression on this subset, termed TS+, and not on 
      the majority (70 to 80%) of morphologically similar trypanosomes, named TS-, is 
      unknown. To determine the roles of the TS+ and TS- subsets in T. cruzi invasion, 
      we prepared pure populations of TS- and TS+ trypanosomes using magnetic beads 
      coated with a monoclonal antibody specific for the tandem repeat unit of the 
      trans-sialidase C terminus. After removal of nonadherent TS- trypomastigotes, the 
      TS+ trypomastigotes were isolated from the beads by specific elusion with a 
      synthetic peptide epitope of the trans-sialidase monoclonal antibody. 
      Confirmation of TS+ and TS- phenotypes was obtained by immunofluorescence, 
      immunoblotting, and sialidase or sialyl transferase activity measurements. The 
      TS+ trypanosomes were highly invasive, as they attached to, penetrated, and 
      thrived in cultured mammalian cells much more efficiently than did unfractionated 
      parasites. The critical role of the trans-sialidase in invasion was underscored 
      by the observation that infection was neutralized by human antibodies to 
      transsialidase. What's more, the TS- parasites, in sharp contrast to their TS+ 
      counterparts, were extremely inefficient in invading epithelial cells and 
      fibroblasts. Further, introduction of small amounts of exogenous trans-sialidase 
      into suspensions of nonpenetrating TS- parasites converted them to a highly 
      invasive phenotype indistinguishable from that of the TS+ population. Rescue of 
      the invasive phenotype was specific for the T. cruzi enzyme, for it didn't happen 
      with bacterial and viral sialidases. The in vitro results were confirmed in the 
      murine model of Chagas' disease, as TS- trypomastigotes were relatively avirulent 
      while TS+ trypomastigotes were more virulent than unfractionated parasites.

TI  - Cytomegalovirus infection in cardiac transplant recipients associated with 
      chronic T cell subset ratio inversion with expansion of a Leu-7+ TS-C+ subset.
PG  - 515-24
AB  - Lymphocyte subsets were analysed in 18 patients during the first 3 years after 
      cardiac transplantation. The patients received Cyclosporin A and prednisolone for 
      maintenance immunosuppression. Serological evidence of active cytomegalovirus 
      (CMV) infection was found in 13 cases (72%), and in 12 of these an inversion 
      usually of the T helper/T suppressor-cytotoxic ratio (TH/TS-C) was detected. T 
      subset inversion usually preceded the diagnostic rise in CMV antibody titre. In 
      69% of patients with CMV the TH/TS-C ratio remained inverted throughout follow-up 
      (245-951 days). Persistent T subset inversion was not found in all five patients 
      who lacked serological evidence of active CMV. Chronic inversion consisted of an 
      average increase in TS-C of 152% and an average decline in TH cells of 31% as 
      compared to CMV negative patients. The proportion of lymphoid cells reacting with 
      a phenotypic marker for natural killer (NK) cells (Leu-7) was increased by 83%. 
      These alterations were also reflected in the absolute numbers of cells with these 
      markers. Two-colour immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the expanded TS-C 
      population present during chronic inversion was predominantly Leu-7+. As TS-C+ 
      Leu-7+ cells in healthy persons may be hyporesponsive NK cells, a sustained 
      increase in this cell type in allograft recipients could further reduce 
      immunocompetence, thereby predisposing to superinfection or malignancy.
