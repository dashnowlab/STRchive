TI  - Unraveling O-Glycan Diversity of Mucins: Insights from SmE Mucinase and 
      Ultraviolet Photodissociation Mass Spectrometry.
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.4c02011 [doi]
AB  - Deciphering the pattern and abundance of O-glycosylation of mucin domain 
      proteins, glycoproteins heavily implicated in cancer and other diseases, remains 
      an ongoing challenge. Both the macro- and microheterogeneity of glycosylation 
      complicates the analysis, motivating the development of new strategies for 
      structural characterization of this diverse class of glycoproteins. Here we 
      combine digestion of mucin domain proteins using a targeted protease, Enhancin 
      from Serratia marcescens (SmE), with ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD) mass 
      spectrometry to advance glycan mapping and elucidation of O-glycosylation trends 
      of densely glycosylated mucin proteins. UVPD facilitates identification of 
      O-glycoforms of mucin domain proteins TIM-1, MUC-1 and MUC-16. Additionally, UVPD 
      elucidates several glycoforms of MUC-16 and contributes to the discovery of 
      O-glycosylation across tandem repeats of MUC-1.

TI  - Stenotrophomonas maltophilia provokes NEU1-mediated release of a 
      flagellin-binding decoy receptor that protects against lethal infection.

AB  - Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (Sm), a multidrug-resistant pathogen often isolated 
      from immunocompromised individuals, presents its flagellin to multimeric tandem 
      repeats within the ectodomain of mucin-1 (MUC1-ED), expressed on airway 
      epithelia. Flagellated Sm increases neuraminidase-1 (NEU1) sialidase association 
      with and desialylation of MUC1-ED. This NEU1-mediated MUC1-ED desialylation 
      unmasks cryptic binding sites for Sm flagellin, increasing flagellin and Sm 
      binding to airway epithelia. MUC1 overexpression increases receptor number 
      whereas NEU1 overexpression elevates receptor binding affinity. Silencing of 
      either MUC1 or NEU1 reduces the flagellin-MUC1 interaction. Sm/flagellin provokes 
      MUC1-ED autoproteolysis at a juxtamembranous glycine-serine peptide bond. MUC1-ED 
      shedding from the epithelium not only occurs in vitro, but in the bronchoalveolar 
      compartments of Sm/flagellin-challenged mice and patients with 
      ventilator-associated Sm pneumonia. Finally, the soluble flagellin-targeting, 
      MUC1-ED decoy receptor dose-dependently inhibits multiple Sm flagellin-driven 
      pathogenic processes, in vitro, including motility, biofilm formation, adhesion, 
      and proinflammatory cytokine production, and protects against lethal Sm lung 
      infection, in vivo.

TI  - Analysis of Molecular Genetic Variants of Lgals4 in Esophageal Cancer: A 
      Preliminary Report.
LID - 10.1007/s10528-024-10780-y [doi]
AB  - Esophageal cancer is the eighth most common cancer worldwide and fourth most 
      common in developing countries. Altered glycosylation pattern of cell membrane 
      molecules along with inflammation is a characteristic attribute of oncogenesis. 
      Galectin-4, a tandem repeat galectin, has shown effect on cancer 
      progression/metastasis in digestive system cancers. This role of galectin-4 can 
      be attributed to variations in LGALS4, gene encoding galectin-4. The present 
      case-control study was designed to analyze four intronic SNPs in LGALS4 with 
      susceptibility toward esophageal cancer.Esophageal cancer cases and age- and 
      gender-matched apparently healthy individuals were recruited for the present 
      study. Genotyping of rs8113319, rs4802886, rs4802887, and rs12610990 was carried 
      out using Sanger sequencing and PCR-RFLP. MedCalc software, SNPStats and SHEsis 
      online platform were used for statistical analysis.Genotypic analyses revealed an 
      overall increased heterozygosity of rs12610990, rs4802886, and rs4802887, and AA 
      genotype of rs8113319 in the study participants. Haplotypic analyses also 
      revealed a predominance of AAAT haplotype in the cases. Moreover, combined 
      presence of wild alleles of rs4802886 and rs4802887 could influence protection 
      toward disease, and combined presence of wild alleles of rs12610990 and rs8113319 
      could influence disease susceptibility. Furthermore, a strong linkage 
      disequilibrium was also observed between the SNPs. Further studies are underway 
      to validate galectin-4 and its genetic variants as blood-based biomarkers in 
      early disease diagnosis, improving treatment outcome.

TI  - Structural and molecular insight into antibody recognition of dynamic neoepitopes 
      in membrane tethered MUC1 of pancreatic cancer cells and secreted exosomes.
PG  - 564-572
LID - 10.1039/d3cb00036b [doi]
AB  - Pancreatic cancer is highly metastatic and has poor prognosis, mainly due to 
      delayed detection, often after metastasis has occurred. A novel method to enable 
      early detection and disease intervention is strongly needed. Here we unveil for 
      the first time that pancreatic cancer cells (PANC-1) and secreted exosomes 
      express MUC1 bearing cancer-relevant dynamic epitopes recognized specifically by 
      an anti-MUC1 antibody (SN-131), which binds specifically core 1 but not core 2 
      type O-glycans found in normal cells. Comprehensive assessment of the essential 
      epitope for SN-131 indicates that PANC-1 cells produce dominantly MUC1 with 
      aberrant O-glycoforms such as Tn, T, and sialyl T (ST) antigens. Importantly, 
      SN-131 showed the highest affinity with MUC1 bearing ST antigen at the 
      immunodominant DTR motif (K(D) = 1.58 nM) independent of the glycosylation states 
      of other Ser/Thr residues in the MUC1 tandem repeats. The X-ray structure 
      revealed that SN-131 interacts directly with Neu5Ac and root GalNAc of the ST 
      antigen in addition to the proximal peptide region. Our results demonstrate that 
      targeting O-glycosylated "dynamic neoepitopes" found in the membrane-tethered 
      MUC1 is a promising therapeutic strategy for improving the treatment outcome of 
      patients with pancreatic cancer.

TI  - VNtyper enables accurate alignment-free genotyping of MUC1 coding VNTR using 
      short-read sequencing data in autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney 
      disease.

AB  - The human genome comprises approximately 3% of tandem repeats with variable 
      length (VNTR), a few of which have been linked to human rare diseases. Autosomal 
      dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease-MUC1 (ADTKD-MUC1) is caused by 
      specific frameshift variants in the coding VNTR of the MUC1 gene. Calling 
      variants from VNTR using short-read sequencing (SRS) is challenging due to poor 
      read mappability. We developed a computational pipeline, VNtyper, for reliable 
      detection of MUC1 VNTR pathogenic variants and demonstrated its clinical utility 
      in two distinct cohorts: (1) a historical cohort including 108 families with 
      ADTKD and (2) a replication naive cohort comprising 2,910 patients previously 
      tested on a panel of genes involved in monogenic renal diseases. In the 
      historical cohort all cases known to carry pathogenic MUC1 variants were 
      re-identified, and a new 25bp-frameshift insertion in an additional mislaid 
      family was detected. In the replication cohort, we discovered and validated 30 
      new patients.

AB  - The interplay between genetic and environmental factors influences the course of 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD). In this context, genetic alterations in the kidney 
      disease gene MUC1 (Mucin1) predispose to the development of CKD. These variations 
      comprise the polymorphism rs4072037, which alters splicing of MUC1 mRNA, the 
      length of a region with variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR), and rare 
      autosomal-dominant inherited dominant-negative mutations in or 5' to the VNTR 
      that causes autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD-MUC1). As 
      hypoxia plays a pivotal role in states of acute and chronic kidney injury, we 
      explored the effects of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIF) on the 
      expression of MUC1 and its pathogenic variants in isolated primary human renal 
      tubular cells. We defined a HIF-binding DNA regulatory element in the 
      promoter-proximal region of MUC1 from which hypoxia or treatment with HIF 
      stabilizers, which were recently approved for an anti-anemic therapy in CKD 
      patients, increased levels of wild-type MUC1 and the disease-associated variants. 
      Thus, application of these compounds might exert unfavorable effects in patients 
      carrying MUC1 risk variants.

AB  - The human genome contains more than one million tandem repeats (TRs), DNA 
      sequences containing multiple approximate copies of a motif repeated 
      contiguously. TRs account for significant genetic variation, with 50 + diseases 
      attributed to changes in motif number. A few diseases have been to be caused by 
      small indels in variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) including poly-cystic 
      kidney disease type 1 (MCKD1) and monogenic type 1 diabetes. However, small 
      indels in VNTRs are largely unexplored mainly due to the long and complex 
      structure of VNTRs with multiple motifs. We developed a method, code-adVNTR, that 
      utilizes multi-motif hidden Markov models to detect both, motif count variation 
      and small indels, within VNTRs. In simulated data, code-adVNTR outperformed 
      GATK-HaplotypeCaller in calling small indels within large VNTRs. We used 
      code-adVNTR to characterize coding VNTRs in the 1000 genomes data identifying 
      many population-specific variants, and to reliably call MUC1 mutations for MCKD1.

TI  - Detecting MUC1 Variants in Patients Clinicopathologically Diagnosed With Having 
      Autosomal Dominant Tubulointerstitial Kidney Disease.
PG  - 857-866
LID - 10.1016/j.ekir.2021.12.037 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD)-MUC1 
      is predominantly caused by frameshift mutations owing to a single-base insertion 
      into the variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) region in MUC1. Because of the 
      complexity of the variant hotspot, identification using short-read sequencers 
      (SRSs) is challenging. Although recent studies have revealed the usefulness of 
      long-read sequencers (LRSs), the prevalence of MUC1 variants in patients with 
      clinically suspected ADTKD remains unknown. We aimed to clarify this prevalence 
      and the genetic characteristics and clinical manifestations of ADTKD-MUC1 in a 
      Japanese population using an SRS and an LRS. METHODS: From January 2015 to 
      December 2019, genetic analysis was performed using an SRS in 48 patients with 
      clinically suspected ADTKD. Additional analyses were conducted using an LRS in 
      patients with negative SRS results. RESULTS: Short-read sequencing results 
      revealed MUC1 variants in 1 patient harboring a cytosine insertion in the second 
      repeat unit of the VNTR region; however, deeper VNTR regions could not be read by 
      the SRS. Therefore, we conducted long-read sequencing analysis of 39 cases and 
      detected MUC1 VNTR variants in 8 patients (in total, 9 patients from unrelated 
      families). With the inclusion of family-affected patients (n = 31), the median 
      age at the development of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) was 45 years (95% CI: 
      40-40 years). CONCLUSION: In Japan, the detection rate of MUC1 variants in 
      patients with clinically suspected ADTKD was 18.8%. More than 20% of patients 
      with negative SRS results had MUC1 variants detected by an LRS.

TI  - A Possible Inhibitory Role of Sialic Acid on MUC1 in Peritoneal Dissemination of 
      Clear Cell-Type Ovarian Cancer Cells.
LID - 10.3390/molecules26195962 [doi]
LID - 5962
AB  - The role of sialic acids on MUC1 in peritoneal dissemination of ovarian cancer 
      cells was investigated. A human ovarian carcinoma cell line, ES-2, was 
      transfected with full-length MUC1 containing 22 or 42 tandem repeats. These 
      transfectants were less adherent to monolayers of patient-derived mesothelial 
      cells than ES-2/mock transfectants. When these cells were inoculated into the 
      abdominal cavity of female nude mice, mice that had received the transfectants 
      showed better survival. When the transfectants were mixed with sialidase and 
      injected, the survival was poorer, whereas when they were mixed with 
      N-acetyl-2,3-dehydro-2-deoxyneuraminic acid, a sialidase inhibitor, the survival 
      was significantly prolonged. These behaviors, concerned with peritoneal 
      implantation and dissemination observed in vitro and in vivo, were dependent on 
      the expression of MUC1. Therefore, sialic acid linked to MUC1 in the form, at 
      least in part, of sialyl-T, as shown to be recognized by monoclonal antibody 
      MY.1E12, is responsible for the suppression of adhesion of these cells to 
      mesothelial cells and the suppression of peritoneal implantation and 
      dissemination.

AB  - MUC1, the transmembrane glycoprotein Mucin 1, is usually found to be 
      overexpressed in a variety of epithelial cancers playing an important role in 
      disease progression. MUC1 isoforms such as MUC1/Y, which lacks the entire 
      variable number of tandem repeat region, are involved in oncogenic processes by 
      enhancing tumour initiation. MUC1/Y is therefore considered a promising target 
      for the identification and treatment of epithelial cancers; but so far, the 
      precise role of MUC1/Y remains to be elucidated. In this work, we developed and 
      identified a DNA aptamer that specifically recognizes the splice variant MUC1/Y 
      for the first time. The DNA aptamer could bind to a wide variety of human cancer 
      cells, and treatment of MUC1/Y positive cells resulted in reduced growth in

AB  - The modulation of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) by small molecules 
      represents a valuable strategy for pharmacological intervention in several human 
      diseases. In this context, computer-aided drug discovery techniques offer useful 
      resources to predict the network of interactions governing the recognition 
      process between protein partners, thus furnishing relevant information for the 
      design of novel PPI modulators. In this work, we focused our attention on the 
      MUC1-CIN85 complex as a crucial PPI controlling cancer progression and 
      metastasis. MUC1 is a transmembrane glycoprotein whose extracellular domain 
      contains a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs) regions that are highly 
      glycosylated in normal cells and under-glycosylated in cancer. The 
      hypo-glycosylation fosters the exposure of the backbone to new interactions with 
      other proteins, such as CIN85, that alter the intracellular signalling in tumour 
      cells. Herein, different computational approaches were combined to investigate 
      the molecular recognition pattern of MUC1-CIN85 PPI thus unveiling new structural 
      information useful for the design of MUC1-CIN85 PPI inhibitors as potential 
      anti-metastatic agents.

TI  - TF-containing MUC1 glycopeptides fail to entice Galectin-1 recognition of 
      tumor-associated Thomsen-Freidenreich (TF) antigen (CD176) in solution.
PG  - 657-666
LID - 10.1007/s10719-020-09951-x [doi]
AB  - Aberrant Mucin-1 (MUC1) glycosylation with the Thomsen-Friedenreich (TF) 
      tumor-associated antigen (CD176) is a hallmark of epithelial carcinoma 
      progression and poor patient prognosis. Recognition of TF by glycan-binding 
      proteins, such as galectins, enables the pathological repercussions of this 
      glycan presentation, yet the underlying binding specificities of different 
      members of the galectin family is a matter of continual investigation. While 
      Galectin-3 (Gal-3) recognition of TF has been well-documented at both the 
      cellular and molecular level, Galectin-1 (Gal-1) recognition of TF has only truly 
      been alluded to in cell-based platforms. Immunohistochemical analyses have 
      purported Gal-1 binding to TF on MUC1 at the cell surface, however binding at the 
      molecular level was inconclusive. We hypothesize that glycan scaffold (MUC1's 
      tandem repeat peptide sequence) and/or multivalency play a role in the binding 
      recognition of TF antigen by Gal-1. In this study we have developed a method for 
      large-scale expression of Gal-1 and its histidine-tagged analog for use in 
      binding studies by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and development of an 
      analytical method based on AlphaScreen technology to screen for Gal-1 inhibitors. 
      Surprisingly, neither glycan scaffold or multivalent presentation of TF antigen 
      on the scaffold was able to entice Gal-1 recognition to the level of affinity 
      expected for functional significance. Future evaluations of the Gal-1/TF binding 
      interaction in order to draw connections between immunohistochemical data and 
      analytical measurements are warranted.

AB  - We reported a large Chinese family diagnosed with autosomal dominant 
      tubulointerstitial kidney disease caused by MUC1 mutation (ADTKD-MUC1). Cytosine 
      duplication within a string of 7 cytosines in the variable-number tandem repeats 
      (VNTR) region of the MUC1 gene was detected by long-read single-molecule 
      real-time (SMRT) sequencing. MUC1 frameshift protein (MUC1fs) was found to be 
      expressed in renal tubules and urinary exfoliated cells by pathological 
      examination. The family, which consisted of 5 generations including 137 
      individuals, was followed for 5 years. Genetic testing was performed in 
      thirty-four individuals, 17 of whom carried MUC1 mutations. The 
      ADTKD-MUC1-affected individuals had an elevated incidence of hyperuricaemia 
      without gout attack. Within five years, higher baseline levels of urinary 
      alpha1-microglobulin were detected in affected individuals with rapidly progressing 
      renal failure than in affected individuals with stable renal function, and the 
      increases manifested even before increases in serum creatinine. This study 
      demonstrates that SMRT sequencing is an effective method for the identification 
      of MUC1 mutations. The pathological examination of MUC1fs expression in renal 
      tissue and urinary exfoliated cells can contribute to early screening of family 
      members suspected to be affected. It is suggested that affected individuals with 
      elevated urinary alpha1-microglobulin levels should be closely monitored for renal 
      function.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is the most common tumor of the biliary 
      tract. The incidence of GBC shows a large geographic variability, being 
      particularly frequent in Native American populations. In Chile, GBC represents 
      the second cause of cancer-related death among women. We describe here the 
      establishment of three novel cell lines derived from the ascitic fluid of a 
      Chilean GBC patient, who presented 46% European, 36% Mapuche, 12% Aymara and 6% 
      African ancestry. RESULTS: After immunocytochemical staining of the primary cell 
      culture, we isolated and comprehensively characterized three independent clones 
      (PUC-GBC1, PUC-GBC2 and PUC-GBC3) by short tandem repeat DNA profiling and RNA 
      sequencing as well as karyotype, doubling time, chemosensitivity, in vitro 
      migration capability and in vivo tumorigenicity assay. Primary culture cells 
      showed high expression of CK7, CK19, CA 19-9, MUC1 and MUC16, and negative 
      expression of mesothelial markers. The three isolated clones displayed an 
      epithelial phenotype and an abnormal structure and number of chromosomes. RNA 
      sequencing confirmed the increased expression of cytokeratin and mucin genes, and 
      also of TP53 and ERBB2 with some differences among the three cells lines, and 
      revealed a novel exonic mutation in NF1. The PUC-GBC3 clone was the most 
      aggressive according to histopathological features and the tumorigenic capacity 
      in NSG mice. CONCLUSIONS: The first cell lines established from a Chilean GBC 
      patient represent a new model for studying GBC in patients of Native American 
      descent.

AB  - Mucin 1 is a cell-membrane associated mucin, expressed on epithelial and immune 
      cells that helps protect against pathogenic infections. In humans, MUC1 is highly 
      polymorphic, predominantly due to the presence of a variable number tandem repeat 
      (VNTR) region in the extracellular domain that results in MUC1 molecules of 
      typically either short or long length. A genetic link is known between these MUC1 
      polymorphisms and inflammation-driven diseases, although the mechanism is not 
      fully understood. We previously showed that MUC1 on murine macrophages 
      specifically restricts activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby repressing 
      inflammation. This study evaluated the effect of MUC1 VNTR polymorphisms on 
      activity of the NLRP3 inflammasome in human macrophages, finding that long MUC1 
      alleles correlated with increased IL-1beta production following NLRP3 inflammasome 
      activation. This indicates that the length of MUC1 can influence IL-1beta 
      production, thus providing the first evidence of an immune-modulatory role of 
      MUC1 VNTR polymorphisms in human macrophages.

AB  - Cell surface molecules aberrantly expressed or overexpressed by myeloid leukemic 
      cells represent potential disease-specific therapeutic targets for antibodies. 
      MUC1 is a polymorphic glycoprotein, the cleavage of which yields two unequal 
      chains: a large extracellular alpha subunit containing a tandem repeat array bound in 
      a strong noncovalent interaction to a smaller beta subunit containing the 
      transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Because the alpha-chain can be released from 
      the cell-bound domains of MUC1, agents directed against the alpha-chain will not 
      effectively target MUC1(+) cells. The MUC1 SEA (a highly conserved protein module 
      so called from its initial identification in a sea urchin sperm protein, in 
      enterokinase, and in agrin) domain formed by the binding of the alpha and beta chains  
      represents a stable structure fixed to the cell surface at all times. DMB-5F3, a 
      partially humanized murine anti-MUC1 SEA domain monoclonal antibody, was used to 
      examine MUC1 expression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and was found to bind 
      acute myelomonocytic and monocytic leukemia (AML-M4 and AML-M5) cell lines. We 
      also examined monocytic neoplasms freshly obtained from patients including 
      chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, which were 
      found to uniformly express MUC1. CD34(+)/lin(-)/CD38(-) or CD38(+) presumed 
      leukemic stem cell populations from CD34(+) AML and CD34(-)CD38(-) or CD38(+) 
      populations from CD34(-) AML were also found to express MUC1, although at low 
      percentages. Based on these studies, we generated an anti-MUC1 immunotoxin to 
      directly gauge the cytotoxic efficacy of targeting AML-bound MUC1. Using 
      single-chain DMB-5F3 fused to recombinant gelonin toxin, the degree of AML 
      cytotoxicity was found to correlate with MUC1 expression. Our data support the 
      use of an anti-MUC1 SEA module-drug conjugates to selectively target and inhibit 
      MUC1-expressing myelomonocytic leukemic cells.

TI  - Single molecule real time sequencing in ADTKD-MUC1 allows complete assembly of 
      the VNTR and exact positioning of causative mutations.

AB  - Recently, the Mucin-1 (MUC1) gene has been identified as a causal gene of 
      autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD). Most causative 
      mutations are buried within a GC-rich 60 basepair variable number of tandem 
      repeat (VNTR), which escapes identification by massive parallel sequencing 
      methods due to the complexity of the VNTR. We established long read single 
      molecule real time sequencing (SMRT) targeted to the MUC1-VNTR as an alternative 
      strategy to the snapshot assay. Our approach allows complete VNTR assembly, 
      thereby enabling the detection of all variants residing within the VNTR and 
      simultaneous determination of VNTR length. We present high resolution data on the 
      VNTR architecture for a cohort of snapshot positive (n = 9) and negative (n = 7) 
      ADTKD families. By SMRT sequencing we could confirm the diagnosis in all 
      previously tested cases, reconstruct both VNTR alleles and determine the exact 
      position of the causative variant in eight of nine families. This study 
      demonstrates that precise positioning of the causative mutation(s) and 
      identification of other coding and noncoding sequence variants in ADTKD-MUC1 is 
      feasible. SMRT sequencing could provide a powerful tool to uncover potential 
      factors encoded within the VNTR that associate with intra- and interfamilial 
      phenotype variability of MUC1 related kidney disease.

TI  - Inhibition of MUC1 biosynthesis via threonyl-tRNA synthetase suppresses 
      pancreatic cancer cell migration.
PG  - e424
LID - 10.1038/emm.2017.231 [doi]
AB  - Mucin1 (MUC1), a heterodimeric oncoprotein, containing tandem repeat structures 
      with a high proportion of threonine, is aberrantly overexpressed in many human 
      cancers including pancreatic cancer. Since the overall survival rate of 
      pancreatic cancer patients has remained low for several decades, novel 
      therapeutic approaches are highly needed. Intestinal mucin has been known to be 
      affected by dietary threonine supply since de novo synthesis of mucin proteins is 
      sensitive to luminal threonine concentration. However, it is unknown whether 
      biosynthesis of MUC1 is regulated by threonine in human cancers. In this study, 
      data provided suggests that threonine starvation reduces the level of MUC1 and 
      inhibits the migration of MUC1-expressing pancreatic cancer cells. Interestingly, 
      knockdown of threonyl-tRNA synthetase (TRS), an enzyme that catalyzes the 
      ligation of threonine to its cognate tRNA, also suppresses MUC1 levels but not 
      mRNA levels. The inhibitors of TRS decrease the level of MUC1 protein and 
      prohibit the migration of MUC1-expressing pancreatic cancer cells. In addition, a 
      positive correlation between TRS and MUC1 levels is observed in human pancreatic 
      cancer cells. Concurrent with these results, the bioinformatics data indicate 
      that co-expression of both TRS and MUC1 is correlated with the poor survival of 
      pancreatic cancer patients. Taken together, these findings suggest a role for TRS 
      in controlling MUC1-mediated cancer cell migration and provide insight into 
      targeting TRS as a novel therapeutic approach to pancreatic cancer treatment.

AB  - Mucin 1 kidney disease, previously referred to as medullary cystic kidney disease 
      type 1, is a rare hereditary kidney disease. It is one of several diseases now 
      termed autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease, as proposed by a 
      KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) consensus report in 2014. 
      Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney diseases share common clinical 
      findings, such as autosomal dominant inheritance, bland urinary sediment, absent 
      to mild proteinuria, and progressive loss of kidney function. Although the 
      pathophysiology of mucin 1 kidney disease is still under investigation, genetic 
      testing has been developed to detect the most well-known mutation, a single 
      cytosine insertion into a string of 7 cytosines in the variable-number tandem 
      repeat (VNTR) region of the MUC-1 gene. With this diagnostic tool, nephrologists 
      can offer genetic counseling to affected families and monitor closely for 
      progression of disease. We report a Hispanic patient with a strong family history 
      of chronic kidney disease who tested positive for the MUC1 mutation.

TI  - Analysis of an ADTKD family with a novel frameshift mutation in MUC1 reveals 
      characteristic features of mutant MUC1 protein.
PG  - 2010-2017
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfx083 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medullary cystic kidney disease Type 1 is an autosomal dominant 
      tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD). Recently, mucin 1 (MUC1) was 
      identified as a causal gene of medullary cystic kidney disease (ADTKD-MUC1). 
      However, the MUC1 mutation was found to be a single cytosine insertion in a 
      single copy of the GC-rich variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs), which are 
      very difficult to analyze by next-generation sequencing. To date, other mutations 
      have not been detected in ADTKD-MUC1, and the mutant MUC1 protein has not been 
      analyzed because of the difficulty of genetically modifying the VNTR sequence. 
      METHODS: We conducted whole-exome analyses of an ADTKD family by next-generation 
      sequencing. We also performed histopathological analyses of a renal biopsy from a 
      pedigree family member. We constructed a mutant protein expression vector based 
      on the patient genome sequence and characterized the nature of the mutant 
      protein. RESULTS: We found a novel frameshift mutation before the VNTR in the 
      MUC1 gene. The resulting mutant MUC1 protein had a very similar amino acid 
      sequence and predicted 3D structure to the previously reported mutant protein. 
      Notably, the recombinant mutant MUC1 protein was trapped in the cytoplasm and 
      appeared to self-aggregate. The patient native mutant protein was also found in 
      urine exosomes. CONCLUSIONS: This novel frameshift mutation in the MUC1 gene and 
      consequent mutant protein may contribute to the future discovery of the 
      pathophysiology of ADTKD-MUC1. The mutant MUC1 protein in urine exosomes may be 
      used for non-DNA-related diagnosis.

      Insertion Mutation in a Chinese Family with Medullary Cystic Kidney Disease.
PG  - 2459-2464
LID - 10.4103/0366-6999.216408 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medullary cystic kidney disease (MCKD) is clinically 
      indistinguishable from several other autosomal-dominant renal diseases; thus, 
      molecular genetic testing is needed to establish a definitive diagnosis. A 
      specific type of single cytosine insertion in the variable number tandem repeat 
      (VNTR) of the mucin 1 (MUC1) gene is the only known cause of MCKD1; however, 
      genetic analysis of this mutation is difficult and not yet offered routinely. To 
      identify the causative mutation/s and establish a definitive diagnosis in a 
      Chinese family with chronic kidney disease, clinical assessments and genetic 
      analysis were performed, including using a modified genotyping method to identify 
      the MUC1- VNTR single cytosine insertion. METHODS: Clinical data from three 
      patients in a Chinese family with chronic kidney disease were collected and 
      evaluated. Linkage analysis was used to map the causative locus. Mutation 
      analysis of uromodulin (UMOD) gene was performed using polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR) and direct sequencing. For MUC1 genotyping, the mutant repeat units were 
      enriched by MwoI restriction, and then were amplified and introduced into pMD-18T 
      vectors. The 192 clones per transformant were picked up and tested by colony PCR 
      and second round of MwoI digestion. Finally, Sanger sequencing was used to 
      confirm the MUC1 mutation. RESULTS: Clinical findings and laboratory results were 
      consistent with a tubulointerstitial lesion. Linkage analysis indicated that the 
      family was compatible with the MCKD1 locus. No mutations were found in UMOD gene. 
      Using the modified MUC1 genotyping method, we detected the MUC1-VNTR single 
      cytosine insertion events in three patients of the family; and 
      mutation-containing clones were 12/192, 14/192, and 5/96, respectively, in the 
      three patients. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical and genetic findings could support the 
      MCKD1 diagnosis. The modified strategy has been demonstrated to be a practical 
      way to detect MUC1 mutation.

AB  - Clinical tissue specimens are useful for pathological diagnosis, which is, in 
      some cases, supported by visualization of biomolecule localization. In general, 
      diagnostic specificity in molecular pathology is increased by the acquisition of 
      a probe to distinguish the modification of isomers. Although glycosylation is one 
      of the candidate modifications in a protein, comparative glycan analysis of 
      disease-associated proteins derived from a single tissue section is still 
      challenging because of the lack of analytical sensitivity. Here we demonstrate a 
      possible method for differential glycoform analysis of an endogenous 
      tumor-associated glycoprotein MUC1 by an antibody-overlay lectin microarray. 
      Tissue sections (5 mum thick) of patients with cholangiocarcinoma (CCA; n=21) and 
      pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC; n=50) were stained with an anti-MUC1 
      antibody MY.1E12 that was established as a monoclonal antibody recognizing an 
      MUC1 glycosylation isoform with a sialyl-core 1 structure (NeuAcalpha2-3galactosyl 
      beta1-3-N-acetylgalactosamine). MY.1E12-positive tissue areas (2.5 mm(2)) were 
      selectively dissected with a laser capture microdissection procedure. The 
      membrane MUC1 was enriched by immunoprecipitation with MY.1E12 and subjected to 
      lectin microarray analysis. Even though the reactivities of MY.1E12 between CCA 
      and PDAC were similar, the lectin-binding patterns varied. We found Maackia 
      amurensis leukoagglutinin and pokeweed lectin distinguished MY.1E12-reactive MUC1 
      of CCA from that of PDAC. Moreover, MUC1 with M. amurensis hemagglutinin (MAH) 
      reactivity potentially reflected the degree of malignancy. These results were 
      confirmed with MAH-MY.1E12 double fluorescent immunostaining. These glycan 
      changes on MUC1 were detected with high sensitivity owing to the cluster effect 
      of immobilized lectins on a tandem repeat peptide antigen covered with highly 
      dense glycosylation such as mucin. Our approach provides the information to 
      investigate novel glycodynamics in biology, for example, glycoalteration, as well 
      as diseases related to not only MUC1 but also other membrane proteins.

AB  - Human mucin MUC1 plays an important role in cancer development. The increased 
      level of this molecule expression during cancer cell progression induces 
      metastasis and is associated with poor prognosis for patients. There is a large 
      body of experimental data on the role of various functional domains of human 
      mucin MUC1 in metastasis. While, the cytoplasmic domain determined to play a 
      definitive role, the influence of extracellular domain on cancer cell 
      invasiveness still remains unclear. The present paper reveals that the 
      extracellular domain of MUC1 molecule consists of two functional subdomains-the 
      region of tandem repeats (TR) and the region of irregular repeats (IR). We 
      demonstrate the ability of each of these subdomains to alter the invasiveness of 
      cancer cells. The presence of the MUC1 molecules containing TR subdomain 
      (MUC1-TR) on the surface of low-invasive cancer cells leads to the increase in 
      their transendothelial migration potency, while the addition of the IR subdomain 
      to the MUC1-TR molecule (MUC1-IR-TR) restores their natural low invasiveness. J.

TI  - Microarray Analysis of Antibodies Induced with Synthetic Antitumor Vaccines: 
      Specificity against Diverse Mucin Core Structures.
PG  - 3875-3884
LID - 10.1002/chem.201603921 [doi]
AB  - Glycoprotein research is pivotal for vaccine development and biomarker discovery. 
      Many successful methodologies for reliably increasing the antigenicity toward 
      tumor-associated glycopeptide structures have been reported. Deeper insights into 
      the quality and specificity of the raised polyclonal, humoral reactions are often 
      not addressed, despite the fact that an immunological memory, which produces 
      antibodies with cross-reactivity to epitopes exposed on healthy cells, may cause 
      autoimmune diseases. In the current work, three MUC1 antitumor vaccine candidates 
      conjugated with different immune stimulants are evaluated immunologically. For 
      assessment of the influence of the immune stimulant on antibody recognition, a 
      comprehensive library of mucin 1 glycopeptides (>100 entries) is synthesized and 
      employed in antibody microarray profiling; these range from small 
      tumor-associated glycans (T(N) , ST(N) , and T-antigen structures) to heavily 
      extended O-glycan core structures (type-1 and type-2 elongated core 1-3 tri-, 
      tetra-, and hexasaccharides) glycosylated in variable density at the five 
      different sites of the MUC1 tandem repeat. This is one of the most extensive 
      glycopeptide libraries ever made through total synthesis. On tumor cells, the 
      core 2 beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-1 (C2GlcNAcT-1) is down-regulated, 
      resulting in lower amounts of the branched core 2 structures, which favor 
      formation of linear core 1 or core 3 structures, and in particular, truncated 
      tumor-associated antigen structures. The core 2 structures are commonly found on 
      healthy cells and the elucidation of antibody cross-reactivity to such epitopes 
      may predict the tumor-selectivity and safety of synthetic vaccines. With the 
      extended mucin core structures in hand, antibody cross-reactivity toward the 
      branched core 2 glycopeptide epitopes is explored. It is observed that the 
      induced antibodies recognize MUC1 peptides with very high glycosylation site 
      specificity. The nature of the antibody response is characteristically different 
      for antibodies directed to glycosylation sites in either the immune-dominant PDTR 
      or the GSTA domain. All antibody sera show high reactivity to the 
      tumor-associated saccharide structures on MUC1. Extensive glycosylation with 
      branched core 2 structures, typically found on healthy cells, abolishes antibody 
      recognition of the antisera and suggests that all vaccine conjugates 
      preferentially induce a tumor-specific humoral immune response.

TI  - Mucin-1 Increases Renal TRPV5 Activity In Vitro, and Urinary Level Associates 
      with Calcium Nephrolithiasis in Patients.
PG  - 3447-3458
AB  - Hypercalciuria is a major risk factor for nephrolithiasis. We previously reported 
      that Uromodulin (UMOD) protects against nephrolithiasis by upregulating the renal 
      calcium channel TRPV5. This channel is crucial for calcium reabsorption in the 
      distal convoluted tubule (DCT). Recently, mutations in the gene encoding Mucin-1 
      (MUC1) were found to cause autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease, 
      the same disease caused by UMOD mutations. Because of the similarities between 
      UMOD and MUC1 regarding associated disease phenotype, protein structure, and 
      function as a cellular barrier, we examined whether urinary MUC1 also enhances 
      TRPV5 channel activity and protects against nephrolithiasis. We established a 
      semiquantitative assay for detecting MUC1 in human urine and found that, compared 
      with controls (n=12), patients (n=12) with hypercalciuric nephrolithiasis had 
      significantly decreased levels of urinary MUC1. Immunofluorescence showed MUC1 in 
      the thick ascending limb, DCT, and collecting duct. Applying whole-cell 
      patch-clamp recording of HEK cells, we found that wild-type but not disease 
      mutant MUC1 increased TRPV5 activity by impairing dynamin-2- and 
      caveolin-1-mediated endocytosis of TRPV5. Coimmunoprecipitation confirmed a 
      physical interaction between TRPV5 and MUC1. However, MUC1 did not increase the 
      activity of N-glycan-deficient TRPV5. MUC1 is characterized by variable number 
      tandem repeats (VNTRs) that bind the lectin galectin-3; galectin-3 siRNA but not 
      galectin-1 siRNA prevented MUC1-induced upregulation of TRPV5 activity. 
      Additionally, MUC1 lacking VNTRs did not increase TRPV5 activity. Our results 
      suggest that MUC1 forms a lattice with the N-glycan of TRPV5 via galectin-3, 
      which impairs TRPV5 endocytosis and increases urinary calcium reabsorption.

AB  - Cancer vaccines have often failed to live up to their promise, although recent 
      results with checkpoint inhibitors are reviving hopes that they will soon fulfill 
      their promise. Although mutation-specific vaccines are under development, there 
      is still high interest in an off-the-shelf vaccine to a ubiquitous antigen, such 
      as MUC1, which is aberrantly expressed on most solid and many hematological 
      tumors, including more than 90% of breast carcinomas. Clinical trials for MUC1 
      have shown variable success, likely because of immunological tolerance to a 
      self-antigen and to poor immunogenicity of tandem repeat peptides. We 
      hypothesized that MUC1 peptides could be optimized, relying on heteroclitic 
      optimizations of potential anchor amino acids with and without tumor-specific 
      glycosylation of the peptides. We have identified novel MUC1 class I peptides 
      that bind to HLA-A*0201 molecules with significantly higher affinity and function 
      than the native MUC1 peptides. These peptides elicited CTLs from normal donors, 
      as well as breast cancer patients, which were highly effective in killing 
      MUC1-expressing MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Each peptide elicited lytic responses 
      in greater than 6/8 of normal individuals and 3/3 breast cancer patients. The 
      CTLs generated against the glycosylated-anchor modified peptides cross reacted 
      with the native MUC1 peptide, STAPPVHNV, suggesting these analog peptides may 
      offer substantial improvement in the design of epitope-based vaccines.

AB  - Synthetic macromolecular MUC1 glycopeptides have been used to unravel molecular 
      mechanisms in antibody recognition of disease-specific epitopes. We have 
      established a novel synthetic strategy for MUC1 tandem repeats having complex 
      O-glycosylation states at each repeating unit based on convergent solid-phase 
      fragment condensation under microwave irradiation. We have accomplished the 
      synthesis of 77 amino acid MUC1 glycopeptides (MW = 12...759) having three major 
      antigenic O-glycoforms [Tn, core 1 (T), and core 2 structures] at 10 designated 
      positions out of 19 potential O-glycosylation sites. We demonstrate that the 
      macromolecular MUC1 glycopeptide displaying the essential glycopeptidic 
      neoepitope Pro-Asp-Thr(sialyl-T)-Arg-Pro-Ala-Pro at two different tandem repeats 
      is an excellent serum MUC1 model showing ideal stoichiometric binding with 
      anti-KL6/MUC1 antibody in the sandwich ELISA to quantify human serum KL6/MUC1 
      levels as a critical biomarker of interstitial lung diseases.

AB  - Mucin-1 kidney disease, previously described as medullary cystic kidney disease 
      type 1 (MCKD1, OMIM 174000), is an autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney 
      disease recently shown to be caused by a single-base insertion within the 
      variable number tandem repeat region of the MUC1 gene. Because of variable age of 
      disease onset and often subtle signs and symptoms, clinical diagnosis of mucin-1 
      kidney disease and differentiation from other forms of hereditary kidney disease 
      have been difficult. The causal insertion resides in a variable number tandem 
      repeat region with high GC content, which has made detection by standard 
      next-generation sequencing impossible to date. The inherently difficult nature of 
      this mutation required an alternative method for routine detection and clinical 
      diagnosis of the disease. We therefore developed and validated a mass 
      spectrometry-based probe extension assay with a series of internal controls to 
      detect the insertion event using 24 previously characterized positive samples 
      from patients with mucin-1 kidney disease and 24 control samples known to be wild 
      type for the variant. Validation results indicate an accurate and reliable test 
      for clinically establishing the molecular diagnosis of mucin-1 kidney disease 
      with 100% sensitivity and specificity across 275 tests called.

TI  - Testing for the cytosine insertion in the VNTR of the MUC1 gene in a cohort of 
      Italian patients with autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease.
PG  - 451-455
LID - 10.1007/s40620-016-0282-9 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Medullary cystic kidney disease type 1 (MCKD1; OMIM #174000) is a 
      familial progressive tubule-interstitial nephropathy belonging to the recently 
      defined group of autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney diseases (ADTKD). 
      CASE REPORT: A specific type of cytosine insertion in the extracellular variable 
      number tandem repeat (VNTR) domain of the MUC1 gene causing the disease was 
      tested in a group of 21 families with ADTKD. We identified this type of MUC1 
      mutation in two families, whose affected members are described in detail in this 
      case report. Affected (ADTKD-MUC1) members developed end-stage renal disease 
      (ESRD) with a higher incidence (p = 0.033) and at a younger age (p = 0.013) than 
      probands with ADTKD but without this type of mutation. All patients with 
      MUC1-associated kidney disease shared a rather unspecific tubule-interstitial 
      laboratory pattern without medullary cysts, leading to ESRD between the age of 33 
      and 47 years. We were not able to identify any single common extra-renal feature 
      among affected patients, even if they had various comorbidities, which are 
      described in detail. CONCLUSIONS: We identified this type of MUC1 mutation in 
      9.5 % of families from an ADTKD Italian cohort; larger studies are needed to 
      better define the criteria for genetic testing for this type of mutation.

TI  - Usefulness of Salivary and Serum Auto-antibodies Against Tumor Biomarkers HER2 
      and MUC1 in Breast Cancer Screening.
PG  - 335-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this work was to investigate if serum and salivary 
      auto-antibodies, isotypes IgG and IgM, against HER2 and MUC1 tandem repeat 
      fragments could play a role in breast cancer screening. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Our case-control study was conducted in breast cancer patients, in early stages 
      (n=29), at the gynecology service, Maternity Souissi Hospital, Rabat, Morocco and 
      healthy woman (n=31). Salivary and serum auto-antibodies against HER2 and MUC1 
      (tandem repeat) were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and 
      compared between patients and healthy women using the Mann-Whitney U test. A 
      P-value <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. RESULTS: Our data 
      showed higher expression of all serum and salivary autoantibodies in patients as 
      compared to healthy women p<0.05. However, serum IgM anti-MUC1 expression did not 
      show a significant difference between cases and controls (p=0.79). Similarly, 
      salivary IgG anti-HER2 expression did not differ (p=0.15). The correlation 
      between the different isotypes of antibodies revealed that the highest 
      correlation was between salivary IgG anti-HER2 and salivary IgG anti- 
      MUC1(r=0.65). In fact, we have found in saliva the correlation between 
      autoantibodies anti-MUC1 and anti-HER2 more important than in serum (r=0.59 and 
      r=0. 55). However, the correlation between serum and saliva values for all 
      antibodies was weak. CONCLUSIONS: Autoantibodies against HER2 and MUC1 may 
      provide a useful approach in breast cancer screening when using both serum and 
      saliva values.

AB  - Antibodies against MUC1 are found in circulation of breast cancer (BC) patients. 
      We hypothesized that anti-MUC1 antibodies might be present in even a higher 
      concentration in nipple aspirate fluid (NAF) and could be used to predict 
      aggressiveness of BC. Serum and NAF samples were collected from high risk 
      lesions, BC, and healthy contralateral breasts. ELISA was used to measure the 
      amount of IgG, IgM, and IgA against a tumor-specific MUC1 peptide derived from 
      the extracellular tandem repeat domain of MUC1. Tumor characteristics were 
      recorded prospectively; 120 NAF samples were obtained from a total of 77 women in 
      the study. There was no significant difference of anti-MUC1 antibody levels 
      compared to BC with other lesions. Anti-MUC1 IgG level in NAF was higher in 
      triple negative tumors (P = 0.02); serum anti-MUC1 IgG levels were significantly 
      higher in patients with ER (-) tumor and recurrent disease (P = 0.01); NAF 
      anti-MUC1 IgA levels were significantly higher in patients with LVI and Her2-neu 
      (+) tumors (P < 0.05). These results show that NAF could be a reliable biomarker 
      to predict tumor aggressiveness in BC. A larger study will be needed to confirm 
      these data and to investigate the potential of anti-MUC1 antibodies in NAF and 
      serum to predict disease outcome.

TI  - Molecular basis of antibody binding to mucin glycopeptides in lung cancer.
PG  - 587-94
LID - 10.3892/ijo.2015.3302 [doi]
AB  - Glycopeptides bearing Tn epitopes are emerging targets for cancer diagnosis and 
      immunotherapy. In this study, we analyzed membrane proteins containing 
      O-glycosylated tandem repeat (TR) sequences in lung cancer patients of different 
      types and stages, using gene microarray data in public domain. The expression of 
      Tn and glycopeptide epitopes on the surface of lung cancer cell lines were 
      studied by monoclonal IgG antibodies 14A, 16A, and B72.3. The binding of mAbs to 
      synthetic glycopeptides were studied by surface plasmon resonance. Nine mucin 
      mRNAs were found to be expressed in lung cancer patients but at similar level to 
      healthy individuals. At protein level, a glycopeptide epitope on cancer cell 
      surface is preferably recognized by mAb 16A, as compared to peptide-alone (14A) 
      or sugar-alone epitopes (B72.3). 14A and 16A favor clustered TR containing more 
      than three TR sequences, with 10-fold lower Kd than two consecutive TR. B72.3 
      preferrably recognized clustered sialyl-Tn displayed on MUC1 but not other 
      O-glycoproteins, with 100-fold stronger binding when MUC1 is transfected as a 
      sugar carrier, while the total sugar epitopes remain unchanged. These findings 
      indicate that clusters of both TR backbones and sugars are essential for mAb 
      binding to mucin glycopeptides. Three rules of antibody binding to mucin 
      glycopeptides at molecular level are presented here: first, the peptide backbone 
      of a glycopeptide is preferentially recognized by B cells through mutations in 
      complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of B cell receptor, and the 
      sugar-binding specificity is acquired through mutations in frame work of heavy 
      chain; secondly, consecutive tandem repeats (TR) of peptides and glycopeptides 
      are preferentially recognized by B cells, which favor clustered TR containing 
      more than three TR sequences; thirdly, certain sugar-specific B cells recognize 
      and accommodate clustered Tn and sialyl-Tn displayed on the surface of a mucin 
      but not other membrane proteins.

TI  - Expansion of quiescent lung adenocarcinoma CD8+ T cells by MUC1-8-mer peptide-T2 
      cell-beta2 microglobulin complexes.
PG  - 33-42
LID - 10.3892/or.2015.4328 [doi]
AB  - Adoptive immunotherapy requires the isolation of CD8+ T cells specific for 
      tumor-associated antigens, their expansion in vitro and their transfusion to the 
      patient to mediate a therapeutic effect. MUC1 is an important adenocarcinoma 
      antigen immunogenic for T cells. The MUC1-derived SAPDTRPA (MUC1-8-mer) peptide 
      is a potent epitope recognized by CD8+ T cells in murine models. Likewise, the T2 
      cell line has been used as an antigen-presenting cell to activate CD8+ T cells, 
      but so far MUC1 has not been assessed in this context. We evaluated whether the 
      MUC1-8-mer peptide can be presented by T2 cells to expand CD25+CD8+ T cells 
      isolated from HLA-A2+ lung adenocarcinoma patients with stage III or IV tumors. 
      The results showed that MUC1-8-mer peptide-loaded T2 cells activated CD8+ T cells 
      from cancer HLA-A2+ patients when anti-CD2, anti-CD28 antibodies and IL-2 were 
      added. The percentage of CD25+CD8+ T cells was 3-fold higher than those in the 
      non-stimulated cells (P=0.018). HLA-A2+ patient cells showed a significant 
      difference (2.3-fold higher) in activation status than HLA-A2+ healthy control 
      cells (P=0.04). Moreover, 77.6% of MUC1-8-mer peptide-specific CD8+ T cells 
      proliferated following a second stimulation with MUC1-8-mer peptide-loaded T2 
      cells after 10 days of cell culture. There were significant differences in the 
      percentage of basal CD25+CD8+ T cells in relation to the cancer stage; this 
      difference disappeared after MUC1-8-mer peptide stimulation. In conclusion, 
      expansion of CD25+CD8+ T cells by MUC1-8 peptide-loaded T2 cells plus 
      costimulatory signals via CD2, CD28 and IL-2 can be useful in adoptive 
      immunotherapy.

TI  - In healthy volunteers, immunohistochemistry supports squamous to columnar 
      metaplasia as mechanism of expansion of cardia, aggravated by central obesity.
PG  - 1705-14
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2014-308914 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recently, we showed that the length of cardiac mucosa in healthy 
      volunteers correlated with age and obesity. We have now examined the 
      immunohistological characteristics of this expanded cardia to determine whether 
      it may be due to columnar metaplasia of the distal oesophagus. METHODS: We used 
      the squamocolumnar junction (SCJ), antral and body biopsies from the 52 
      Helicobacter pylori-negative healthy volunteers who had participated in our 
      earlier physiological study and did not have hiatus hernia, transsphincteric acid 
      reflux, Barrett's oesophagus or intestinal metaplasia (IM) at cardia. The 
      densities of inflammatory cells and reactive atypia were scored at squamous, 
      cardiac and oxyntocardiac mucosa of SCJ, antrum and body. Slides were stained for 
      caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX-2), villin, trefoil factor family 3 (TFF-3) and 
      liver-intestine (LI)-cadherin, mucin MUC1, Muc-2 and Muc-5ac. In addition, 
      biopsies from 15 Barrett's patients with/without IM were stained and scored as 
      comparison. Immunohistological characteristics were correlated with parameters of 
      obesity and high-resolution pH metry recording. RESULTS: Cardiac mucosa had a 
      similar intensity of inflammatory infiltrate to non-IM Barrett's and greater than 
      any of the other upper GI mucosae. The immunostaining pattern of cardiac mucosa 
      most closely resembled non-IM Barrett's showing only slightly weaker CDX-2 
      immunostaining. In distal oesophageal squamous mucosa, expression of markers of 
      columnar differentiation (TFF-3 and LI-cadherin) was apparent and these 
      correlated with central obesity (correlation coefficient (CC)=0.604, p=0.001 and 
      CC=0.462, p=0.002, respectively). In addition, expression of TFF-3 in distal 
      oesophageal squamous mucosa correlated with proximal extension of gastric acidity 
      within the region of the lower oesophageal sphincter (CC=-0.538, p=0.001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with expansion of cardia in healthy 
      volunteers occurring by squamo columnar metaplasia of distal oesophagus and 
      aggravated by central obesity. This metaplastic origin of expanded cardia may be 
      relevant to the substantial proportion of cardia adenocarcinomas unattributable 
      to H. pylori or transsphincteric acid reflux.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mucin 1 (MUC1) is a complex glycoprotein expressed on the apical 
      surface of normal glandular epithelial cells. It plays a role in a number of 
      biologic processes, and its overexpression is associated with various 
      malignancies. A growing body of literature suggests that MUC1 is a potential 
      diagnostic and therapeutic marker. Increasing numbers of variants are being 
      identified for the MUC1 gene, but their role in carcinogenesis is unclear. 
      Alternative splicing and a specific region on a variable number of tandem repeats 
      are characteristic features of MUC1. However, the underlying mechanisms, overall 
      prevalence, and the function of various MUC1 isoforms are not well characterized. 
      METHODS: In the present study, mRNA expression of nine variants of the MUC1 gene 
      (A-D, X-Z, REP, SEC) was evaluated in normal and tumor tissues obtained from 50 
      patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Associations between 
      expression of various isoforms of MUC1 and important clinicopathologic factors 
      were studied. RESULTS: Specific MUC1 splice variants (i.e., MUC1/C, D, and Z) are 
      correlated with tumor progression in ESCC, whereas MUC1/B-previously suggested as 
      a "normal" variant in some other cancers-has protective effects and is associated 
      with more favorable tumor behavior and better prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Specific 
      isoforms of ESCC are associated with prognosis. Further characterization of 
      different isoforms of MUC1 and their biologic effects is needed to explore their 
      diagnostic and prognostic potential in clinical practice.

TI  - Variable clinical presentation of an MUC1 mutation causing medullary cystic 
      kidney disease type 1.
PG  - 527-35
LID - 10.2215/CJN.06380613 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The genetic cause of medullary cystic kidney disease 
      type 1 was recently identified as a cytosine insertion in the variable number of 
      tandem repeat region of MUC1 encoding mucoprotein-1 (MUC1), a protein that is 
      present in skin, breast, and lung tissue, the gastrointestinal tract, and the 
      distal tubules of the kidney. The purpose of this investigation was to analyze 
      the clinical characteristics of families and individuals with this mutation. 
      DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Families with autosomal dominant 
      interstitial kidney disease were referred for genetic analysis over a 14-year 
      period. Families without UMOD or REN mutations prospectively underwent genotyping 
      for the presence of the MUC1 mutation. Clinical characteristics were 
      retrospectively evaluated in individuals with the MUC1 mutation and historically 
      affected individuals (persons who were both related to genetically affected 
      individuals in such a way that ensured that they could be genetically affected 
      and had a history of CKD stage IV or kidney failure resulting in death, dialysis, 
      or transplantation). RESULTS: Twenty-four families were identified with the MUC1 
      mutation. Of 186 family members undergoing MUC1 mutational analysis, the mutation 
      was identified in 95 individuals, 91 individuals did not have the mutation, 
      and111 individuals were identified as historically affected. Individuals with the 
      MUC1 mutation suffered from chronic kidney failure with a widely variable age of 
      onset of end stage kidney disease ranging from 16 to >80 years. Urinalyses 
      revealed minimal protein and no blood. Ultrasounds of 35 individuals showed no 
      medullary cysts. There were no clinical manifestations of the MUC1 mutation 
      detected in the breasts, skin, respiratory system, or gastrointestinal tract. 
      CONCLUSION: MUC1 mutation results in progressive chronic kidney failure with a 
      bland urinary sediment. The age of onset of end stage kidney disease is highly 
      variable, suggesting that gene-gene or gene-environment interactions contribute 
      to phenotypic variability.

AB  - The MUC1 tumor associated antigen is highly expressed on a range of tumors. Its 
      broad distribution on primary tumors and metastases renders it an attractive 
      target for immunotherapy. After synthesis MUC1 is cleaved, yielding a large 
      soluble extracellular alpha subunit containing the tandem repeats array (TRA) 
      domain specifically bound, via non-covalent interaction, to a smaller beta 
      subunit containing the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Thus far, 
      inconclusive efficacy has been reported for anti-MUC1 antibodies directed against 
      the soluble alpha subunit. Targeting the cell bound beta subunit, may bypass 
      limitations posed by circulating TRA domains. MUC1's signal peptide (SP) domain 
      promiscuously binds multiple MHC class II and Class I alleles, which upon 
      vaccination, generated robust T-cell immunity against MUC1-positive tumors. This 
      is a first demonstration of non-MHC associated, MUC1 specific, cell surfaces 
      presence for MUC1 SP domain. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies generated 
      against MUC1 SP domain specifically bind a large variety of MUC1-positive human 
      solid and haematological tumor cell lines; MUC1-positive bone marrow derived 
      plasma cells obtained from multiple myeloma (MM)-patients, but not MUC1 negative 
      tumors cells, and normal naive primary blood and epithelial cells. Membranal MUC1 
      SP appears mainly as an independent entity but also co-localized with the full 
      MUC1 molecule. MUC1-SP specific binding in BM-derived plasma cells can assist in 
      selecting patients to be treated with anti-MUC1 SP therapeutic vaccine, ImMucin. 
      A therapeutic potential of the anti-MUC1 SP antibodies was suggested by their 
      ability to support of complement-mediated lysis of MUC1-positive tumor cells but 
      not MUC1 negative tumor cells and normal naive primary epithelial cells. These 
      findings suggest a novel cell surface presence of MUC1 SP domain, a potential 
      therapeutic benefit for anti-MUC1 SP antibodies in MUC1-positive tumors and a 
      selection tool for MM patients to be treated with the anti-MUC1 SP vaccine, 
      ImMucin.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Human serum MUC1 peptide fragments bearing aberrant O-glycans are 
      secreted from columnar epithelial cell surfaces and known as clinically important 
      serum biomarkers for the epithelial carcinoma when a specific monoclonal antibody 
      can probe disease-relevant epitopes. Despite the growing importance of MUC1 
      glycopeptides as biomarkers, the precise epitopes of most anti-MUC1 monoclonal 
      antibodies remains unclear. METHODS: A novel protocol for the fabrication of 
      versatile microarray displaying peptide/glycopeptide library was investigated for 
      the construction of highly sensitive and accurate epitope mapping assay of 
      various anti-MUC1 antibodies. RESULTS: Selective imine-coupling between 
      aminooxy-functionalized methacrylic copolymer with phosphorylcholine unit and 
      synthetic MUC1 glycopeptides-capped by a ketone linker at N-terminus provided a 
      facile and seamless protocol for the preparation of glycopeptides microarray 
      platform. It was demonstrated that anti-KL-6 monoclonal antibody shows an 
      extremely specific and strong binding affinity toward MUC1 fragments carrying 
      sialyl T antigen (Neu5Acalpha2,3Galbeta1,3GalNAcalpha1-->) at Pro-Asp-Thr-Arg motif when 
      compared with other seven anti-MUC1 monoclonal antibodies such as VU-3D1, 
      VU-12E1, VU-11E2, Ma552, VU-3C6, SM3, and DF3. The present microarray also 
      uncovered the occurrence of IgG autoantibodies in healthy human sera that bind 
      specifically with sialyl T antigen attached at five potential O-glycosylation 
      sites of MUC1 tandem repeats. CONCLUSION: We established a straightforward 
      strategy toward the standardized microarray platform allowing highly sensitive 
      and accurate epitope mapping analysis by reducing the background noise due to 
      nonspecific protein adsorption. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The present approach would 
      greatly accelerate the discovery research of new class autoantibodies as well as 
      the development of therapeutic mAbs reacting specifically with disease-relevant 
      epitopes.

TI  - Identification and characterization of agonist epitopes of the MUC1-C 
      oncoprotein.
PG  - 161-74
AB  - The MUC1 tumor-associated antigen is overexpressed in the majority of human 
      carcinomas and several hematologic malignancies. Much attention has been paid to 
      the hypoglycosylated variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) region of the 
      N-terminus of MUC1 as a vaccine target, and recombinant viral vector vaccines are 
      also being evaluated that express the entire MUC1 transgene. While previous 
      studies have described MUC1 as a tumor-associated tissue differentiation antigen, 
      studies have now determined that the C-terminus of MUC1 (MUC1-C) is an 
      oncoprotein, and its expression is an indication of poor prognosis in numerous 
      tumor types. We report here the identification of nine potential CD8(+) cytotoxic T 
      lymphocyte epitopes of MUC1, seven in the C-terminus and two in the VNTR region, 
      and have identified enhancer agonist peptides for each of these epitopes. These 
      epitopes span HLA-A2, HLA-A3, and HLA-A24 major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 
      class I alleles, which encompass the majority of the population. The agonist 
      peptides, compared to the native peptides, more efficiently (a) generate T-cell 
      lines from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of cancer patients, (b) enhance 
      the production of IFN-gamma by peptide-activated human T cells, and (c) lyse human 
      tumor cell targets in an MHC-restricted manner. The agonist epitopes described 
      here can be incorporated into various vaccine platforms and for the ex vivo 
      generation of human T cells. These studies provide the rationale for the 
      T-cell-mediated targeting of the oncogenic MUC1-C, which has been shown to be an 
      important factor in both drug resistance and poor prognosis for numerous tumor 
      types.

TI  - Serum KL-6 concentrations are associated with molecular sizes and efflux behavior 
      of KL-6/MUC1 in healthy subjects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Serum KL-6, a sialylated sugar chain on human MUC1, is used as a 
      marker of interstitial lung diseases. We recently reported that efflux behavior 
      of KL-6/MUC1 from the alveoli into the bloodstream assessed by molecular analysis 
      differed according to genetically determined molecular sizes and influenced serum 
      KL-6 concentrations in sarcoidosis. This study was designed to investigate 
      associations between molecular size and efflux behavior of KL-6/MUC1, and factors 
      contributing to serum KL-6 concentrations in healthy subjects. METHODS: Western 
      blot analysis using anti-KL-6 antibody was performed on serum obtained from 250 
      healthy subjects. RESULTS: The efflux behavior of KL-6/MUC1 differed according to 
      the genetically determined molecular sizes in healthy subjects. In subjects 
      having low molecular size, there were significant associations between smoking 
      status, aging, renal function and serum KL-6 concentrations. However, these 
      associations were not significant in the subjects having higher molecular size 
      and the efflux behavior of high molecular size was the only significant 
      determinant of serum KL-6 concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed an 
      association between KL-6/MUC1 efflux based on molecular size and serum KL-6 
      concentrations in healthy subjects. We propose that the molecular size and efflux 
      behavior of KL-6/MUC1 should be considered when interpreting serum KL-6 
      concentrations.

AB  - The characterization of mucins is critically important for gaining insights into 
      the molecular pathology of diseases, including cancers, as well as for the 
      discovery of biomarkers for disease diagnosis. However, no practical method has 
      yet been reported for identifying mucin proteins. Here, we report a technique for 
      immunological identification of mucins separated by supported molecular matrix 
      electrophoresis (SMME), a recently developed membrane electrophoresis method. The 
      technique involves on-membrane deglycosylation of mucins by using mild periodate 
      oxidation/base-catalyzed elimination, followed by immunostaining with an antibody 
      that specifically recognizes the mucin tandem repeat (TR) peptide. We 
      demonstrated the method's feasibility by using MUC1 derived from 2 cancer cell 
      lines, T47D and HPAF-II. The present method shows potential as an alternative 
      approach for the identification of mucins separated by SMME or blotted from 
      conventional gel electrophoresis, on a PVDF membrane.

TI  - Autoantibodies to MUC1 glycopeptides cannot be used as a screening assay for 
      early detection of breast, ovarian, lung or pancreatic cancer.
PG  - 2045-55
LID - 10.1038/bjc.2013.214 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Autoantibodies have been detected in sera before diagnosis of cancer 
      leading to interest in their potential as screening/early detection biomarkers. 
      As we have found autoantibodies to MUC1 glycopeptides to be elevated in 
      early-stage breast cancer patients, in this study we analysed these 
      autoantibodies in large population cohorts of sera taken before cancer diagnosis. 
      METHODS: Serum samples from women who subsequently developed breast cancer, and 
      aged-matched controls, were identified from UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian 
      Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) and Guernsey serum banks to formed discovery and 
      validation sets. These were screened on a microarray platform of 60mer MUC1 
      glycopeptides and recombinant MUC1 containing 16 tandem repeats. Additional 
      case-control sets comprised of women who subsequently developed ovarian, 
      pancreatic and lung cancer were also screened on the arrays. RESULTS: In the 
      discovery (273 cases, 273 controls) and the two validation sets (UKCTOCS 426 
      cases, 426 controls; Guernsey 303 cases and 606 controls), no differences were 
      found in autoantibody reactivity to MUC1 tandem repeat peptide or glycoforms 
      between cases and controls. Furthermore, no differences were observed between 
      ovarian, pancreatic and lung cancer cases and controls. CONCLUSION: This robust, 
      validated study shows autoantibodies to MUC1 peptide or glycopeptides cannot be 
      used for breast, ovarian, lung or pancreatic cancer screening. This has 
      significant implications for research on the use of MUC1 in cancer detection.

TI  - Mutations causing medullary cystic kidney disease type 1 lie in a large VNTR in 
      MUC1 missed by massively parallel sequencing.
PG  - 299-303

AB  - Although genetic lesions responsible for some mendelian disorders can be rapidly 
      discovered through massively parallel sequencing of whole genomes or exomes, not 
      all diseases readily yield to such efforts. We describe the illustrative case of 
      the simple mendelian disorder medullary cystic kidney disease type 1 (MCKD1), 
      mapped more than a decade ago to a 2-Mb region on chromosome 1. Ultimately, only 
      by cloning, capillary sequencing and de novo assembly did we find that each of 
      six families with MCKD1 harbors an equivalent but apparently independently 
      arising mutation in sequence markedly under-represented in massively parallel 
      sequencing data: the insertion of a single cytosine in one copy (but a different 
      copy in each family) of the repeat unit comprising the extremely long ( approximately 1.5-5 
      kb), GC-rich (>80%) coding variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) sequence in the 
      MUC1 gene encoding mucin 1. These results provide a cautionary tale about the 
      challenges in identifying the genes responsible for mendelian, let alone more 
      complex, disorders through massively parallel sequencing.

TI  - Correlation between auto-antibodies to survivin and MUC1 variable number tandem

AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency and correlation 
      between auto-antibodies to survivin and MUC1 variable number tandem repeats 
      (VNTR) in colorectal cancer (CRC), which can provide valuable information for the 
      design of immunotherapeutic vaccines for this disease. METHODS: Enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were used to examine the level of auto-antibodies 
      against survivin and MUC1 VNTR in the serum of 135 CRC patients and 95 healthy 
      volunteers. RESULTS: Using mean absorbance+2 standard deviations (SD) of the 
      healthy samples as a cut-off value, the positive rates of survivin and MUC1 VNTR 
      auto- antibodies in CRC were 31.1% and 18.5%, respectively. Altogether, the 
      survivin and MUC1 VNTR positive samples accounted for 36.3% of the CRC patients, 
      and 7.4% were positive for both. CONCLUSION: A significant positive correlation 
      was found between levels of specific antibodies against survivin and MUC1 VNTR in 
      the serum of CRC patients (r=0.3652, P<0.0001), suggesting that vaccines against 
      both targets would elicit immune responses more effectively.

PG  - 402-14

AB  - Protein O-glycosylation is an essential step for controlling structure and 
      biological functions of glycoproteins involving differentiation, cell adhesion, 
      immune response, inflammation, and tumorigenesis and metastasis. This study 
      provides evidence of site-specific structural alteration induced during multiple 
      sialylation at Ser/Thr residues of the tandem repeats in human MUC1 glycoprotein. 
      Systematic nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study revealed that sialylation of 
      the MUC1 tandem repeating glycopeptide, 
      Pro-Pro-Ala-His-Gly-Val-Thr-Ser-Ala-Pro-Asp-Thr-Arg-Pro-Ala-Pro-Gly-Ser-Thr-Ala 
      with core 2-type O-glycans at five potential glycosylation sites, afforded a 
      specific conformational change at one of the most important cancer-relevant 
      epitopes (Pro-Asp-Thr-Arg). This result indicates that disease-relevant epitope 
      structures of human epithelial cell surface mucins can be altered both by the 
      introduction of an inner GalNAc residue and by the distal sialylation in a 
      peptide sequence-dependent manner. These data demonstrate the feasibility of 
      NMR-based structural characterization of glycopeptides synthesized in a chemical 
      and enzymatic manner in examining the conformational impact of the distal 
      glycosylation at multiple O-glycosylation sites of mucin-like domains.

TI  - Autoantibodies against the signal peptide domain of MUC1 in patients with 
      multiple myeloma: Implications for disease diagnosis and prognosis.
PG  - 1092-1098
AB  - Naturally generated autoantibodies to tumor-associated antigens such as MUC1 can 
      assist in cancer diagnosis and prognosis. While previous studies have 
      concentrated on the tandem repeat array domain of MUC1, here we focused on MUC1's 
      signal peptide domain. We used ELISA assays with MUC1-specific epitopes and 
      antibodies to quantify soluble MUC1 antigen and anti-MUC1 autoantibodies against 
      the tandem repeat array and signal peptide domains in 15 naive donors and 27 
      multiple myeloma cancer patients. We showed a significant increase in up to 
      24-fold (P<0.004) only in the levels of anti-MUC1 signal peptide autoantibodies 
      in the sera of multiple myeloma patients vs. naive donors. This increase stemmed 
      chiefly from the preferred immunogenicity of the signal peptide. Moreover, a 
      significant positive correlation (R(2)=0.5361, P<0.048, Pearson correlation) was 
      shown between the levels of soluble MUC1 and anti-MUC1 signal peptide 
      autoantibodies in multiple myeloma patients with progressive disease while under 
      therapy. This is an initial report on the existence of autoantibodies to a signal 
      peptide domain in general and to the MUC1 signal peptide domain in particular in 
      cancer patients. The autoantibodies had MUC1 rather than signal peptide 
      specificity. The specific nature of the antigen leading to generation of these 
      autoantibodies is still unclear because it is unlikely that the target antigen is 
      a major histo-compatibility complex-peptide complex and we could not trace 
      soluble MUC1 signal peptide fragments in naive donors and multiple myeloma 
      patients. Further validation of these findings may improve diagnostic and 
      prognostic capabilities for MUC1-positive multiple myeloma patients and 
      potentially, patients with other MUC1-positive cancers, as well.

TI  - Mucin variable number tandem repeat polymorphisms and severity of cystic fibrosis 
      lung disease: significant association with MUC5AC.
PG  - e25452
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0025452 [doi]
LID - e25452
AB  - Variability in cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is partially due to non-CFTR 
      genetic modifiers. Mucin genes are very polymorphic, and mucins play a key role 
      in the pathogenesis of CF lung disease; therefore, mucin genes are strong 
      candidates as genetic modifiers. DNA from CF patients recruited for extremes of 
      lung phenotype was analyzed by Southern blot or PCR to define variable number 
      tandem repeat (VNTR) length polymorphisms for MUC1, MUC2, MUC5AC, and MUC7. VNTR 
      length polymorphisms were tested for association with lung disease severity and 
      for linkage disequilibrium (LD) with flanking single nucleotide polymorphisms 
      (SNPs). No strong associations were found for MUC1, MUC2, or MUC7. A significant 
      association was found between the overall distribution of MUC5AC VNTR length and 
      CF lung disease severity (p = 0.025; n = 468 patients); plus, there was robust 
      association of the specific 6.4 kb HinfI VNTR fragment with severity of lung 
      disease (p = 6.2x10(-4) after Bonferroni correction). There was strong LD between 
      MUC5AC VNTR length modes and flanking SNPs. The severity-associated 6.4 kb VNTR 
      allele of MUC5AC was confirmed to be genetically distinct from the 6.3 kb allele, 
      as it showed significantly stronger association with nearby SNPs. These data 
      provide detailed respiratory mucin gene VNTR allele distributions in CF patients. 
      Our data also show a novel link between the MUC5AC 6.4 kb VNTR allele and 
      severity of CF lung disease. The LD pattern with surrounding SNPs suggests that 
      the 6.4 kb allele contains, or is linked to, important functional genetic 
      variation.

TI  - Autoantibodies to aberrantly glycosylated MUC1 in early stage breast cancer are 
      associated with a better prognosis.
PG  - R25
LID - 10.1186/bcr2841 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Detection of serum biomarkers for early diagnosis of breast cancer 
      remains an important goal. Changes in the structure of O-linked glycans occur in 
      all breast cancers resulting in the expression of glycoproteins that are 
      antigenically distinct. Indeed, the serum assay widely used for monitoring 
      disease progression in breast cancer (CA15.3), detects a glycoprotein (MUC1), but 
      elevated levels of the antigen cannot be detected in early stage patients. 
      However, since the immune system acts to amplify the antigenic signal, antibodies 
      can be detected in sera long before the antigen. We have exploited the change in 
      O-glycosylation to measure autoantibody responses to cancer-associated glycoforms 
      of MUC1 in sera from early stage breast cancer patients. METHODS: We used a 
      microarray platform of 60mer MUC1 glycopeptides, to confirm the presence of 
      autoantibodies to cancer associated glycoforms of MUC1 in a proportion of early 
      breast cancer patients (54/198). Five positive sera were selected for detailed 
      definition of the reactive epitopes using on chip glycosylation technology and a 
      panel of glycopeptides based on a single MUC1 tandem repeat carrying specific 
      glycans at specific sites. Based on these results, larger amounts of an extended 
      repertoire of defined MUC1 glycopeptides were synthesised, printed on 
      microarrays, and screened with sera from a large cohort of breast cancer patients 
      (n = 395), patients with benign breast disease (n = 108) and healthy controls (n 
      = 99). All sera were collected in the 1970s and 1980s and complete clinical 
      follow-up of breast cancer patients is available. RESULTS: The presence and level 
      of autoantibodies was significantly higher in the sera from cancer patients 
      compared with the controls, and a highly significant correlation with age was 
      observed. High levels of a subset of autoantibodies to the core3MUC1 
      (GlcNAcbeta1-3GalNAc-MUC1) and STnMUC1 (NeuAcalpha2,6GalNAc-MUC1) glycoforms were 
      significantly associated with reduced incidence and increased time to metastasis. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Autoantibodies to specific cancer associated glycoforms of MUC1 are 
      found more frequently and at higher levels in early stage breast cancer patients 
      than in women with benign breast disease or healthy women. Association of strong 
      antibody response with reduced rate and delay in metastases suggests that 
      autoantibodies can affect disease progression.

TI  - Detection of circulating anti-mucin 1 (MUC1) antibodies in breast tumor patients 
      by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a recombinant MUC1 protein 
      containing six tandem repeats and expressed in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 1903-8
LID - 10.1128/CVI.00142-10 [doi]
AB  - Mucin 1 (MUC1), a tumor-associated antigen, is a transmembrane glycoprotein 
      expressed by normal epithelial cells and overexpressed by carcinomas of 
      epithelial origin. Autoantibodies against MUC1 are often found in circulation, 
      either free or bound to immune complexes, which might contribute to limit tumor 
      outgrowth and dissemination by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and 
      were found favorably predictive of survival in early breast cancer patients. 
      There is no commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit for 
      detecting the anti-MUC1 antibodies in human serum thus far. To detect circulating 
      anti-MUC1 antibodies, we established an indirect ELISA (I-ELISA) using a 
      recombinant MUC1 protein containing six tandem repeat sequences of MUC1 after the 
      antigenicity and specificity of the protein were confirmed. The I-ELISA had a 
      sensitivity of 91.3% and a specificity of 94.1% when a competitive I-ELISA was 
      used as a reference test. The results showed that more patients with benign 
      breast tumors (P = 0.001) and breast cancer patients before primary treatment (P 
      = 0.010) were found to have anti-MUC1 IgG than healthy women; anti-MUC1 IgG 
      before primary treatment was found more than after primary treatment (P = 0.016) 
      in breast cancer patients. Interestingly, the anti-MUC1 IgG serum level was 
      reversely correlated to that of CA15-3 antigen in advanced-stage patients (r = 
      -0.4294, P = 0.046). Our study has demonstrated the suitability of the 
      established I-ELISA for detecting circulating anti-MUC1 antibodies in human 
      serum. Furthermore, we found that circulating anti-MUC1 antibodies may still bind 
      MUC1 shed into blood in stage IV breast cancer, which can support the use of 
      MUC1-target immune therapy strategies.

TI  - Selective expansion of chimeric antigen receptor-targeted T-cells with potent 
      effector function using interleukin-4.
PG  - 25538-44
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M110.127951 [doi]
AB  - Polyclonal T-cells can be directed against cancer using transmembrane fusion 
      molecules known as chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). Although preclinical 
      studies have provided encouragement, pioneering clinical trials using CAR-based 
      immunotherapy have been disappointing. Key obstacles are the need for robust 
      expansion ex vivo followed by sustained survival of infused T-cells in patients. 
      To address this, we have developed a system to achieve selective proliferation of 
      CAR(+) T-cells using IL-4, a cytokine with several pathophysiologic and 
      therapeutic links to cancer. A chimeric cytokine receptor (4alphabeta) was 
      engineered by fusion of the IL-4 receptor alpha (IL-4Ralpha) ectodomain to the 
      beta(c) subunit, used by IL-2 and IL-15. Addition of IL-4 to T-cells that express 
      4alphabeta resulted in STAT3/STAT5/ERK phosphorylation and exponential 
      proliferation, mimicking the actions of IL-2. Using receptor-selective IL-4 
      muteins, partnering of 4alphabeta with gamma(c) was implicated in signal 
      delivery. Next, human T-cells were engineered to co-express 4alphabeta with a CAR 
      specific for tumor-associated MUC1. These T-cells exhibited an unprecedented 
      capacity to elicit repeated destruction of MUC1-expressing tumor cultures and 
      expanded through several logs in vitro. Despite prolonged culture in IL-4, 
      T-cells retained specificity for target antigen, type 1 polarity, and cytokine 
      dependence. Similar findings were observed using CARs directed against two 
      additional tumor-associated targets, demonstrating generality of application. 
      Furthermore, this system allows rapid ex vivo expansion and enrichment of 
      engineered T-cells from small blood volumes, under GMP-compliant conditions. 
      Together, these findings provide proof of principle for the development of 
      IL-4-enhanced T-cell immunotherapy of cancer.

AB  - Mucin1 (MUC1) with altered glycosylation behaves as an antigen unique to 
      adenocarcinomas (ADCs). As a step toward DNA vaccines, the goal of this work was 
      to determine whether MUC1 peptides substituted with an asparagine at O-linked 
      glycosylation sites, might expose MUC1 peptide backbone to serve as immunogens to 
      generate cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 
      patients with ADCs. Substitution of some or all tyrosine and serine residues by 
      asparagine in MUC1 did not inhibit the generation of mucin-specific CTLs. This 
      suggests that MUC1 tandem repeat altered sequences to prevent O-linked 
      glycosylation may be useful as DNA vaccines with tumor specificity.

      Nelore cattle (Bos primigenius indicus).
PG  - 68-70
LID - 10.1590/S1415-47572009005000098 [doi]
AB  - MUC1 is a heavily glycosylated mammalian transmembrane protein expressed by 
      mucosal secretory tissues for both protection against microbial infection and 
      lubrication. An important characteristic of MUC1 is its variable number of tandem 
      repeats (VNTR) containing several sites for O-glycosylation. VNTR length has been 
      associated with many human diseases and with certain economically important 
      traits in domestic ruminants. The aim of the present study was to correlate the 
      length of MUC1 gene VNTR with expected progeny differences (EPDs) obtained for 
      growth, fertility and carcass traits. Five alleles were identified, with alleles 
      containing short VNTRs being more frequent than those with long, thereby 
      demonstrating that Brazilian Nelore cattle are characterized by high frequencies 
      in short MUC1 VNTRs. Statistical analyses revealed there to be no significant 
      association between VNTR length and EPDs for weight at 120 days (W(120) ), 
      scrotal circumference at 365 (SC (365) ) and 450 (SC (450) ) days, age at first 
      calving (AFC), and rib eye area (REA).

TI  - Phase I dose escalation pharmacokinetic assessment of intravenous humanized 
      anti-MUC1 antibody AS1402 in patients with advanced breast cancer.
PG  - R73
LID - 10.1186/bcr2409 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: MUC1 is a cell-surface glycoprotein that establishes a molecular 
      barrier at the epithelial surface and engages in morphogenetic signal 
      transduction. Alterations in MUC1 glycosylation accompany the development of 
      cancer and influence cellular growth, differentiation, transformation, adhesion, 
      invasion, and immune surveillance. A 20-amino-acid tandem repeat that forms the 
      core protein of MUC1 is overexpressed and aberrantly glycosylated in the majority 
      of epithelial tumors. AS1402 (formerly R1550) is a humanized IgG1k monoclonal 
      antibody that binds to PDTR sequences within this tandem repeat that are not 
      exposed in normal cells. AS1402 is a potent inducer of antibody-dependent 
      cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), specifically against MUC1-expressing tumor cells. 
      The objective of this study was to determine the safety, tolerability, and 
      pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of AS1402 monotherapy in patients with 
      locally advanced or metastatic MUC1-positive breast cancer that had progressed 
      after anthracyclines- and taxane-based therapy. METHODS: Patients received AS1402 
      over a 1- to 3-hour intravenous (i.v.) infusion at doses between 1 and 16 mg/kg, 
      with repeated dosing every 1 to 3 weeks (based on patient-individualized PK 
      assessment) until disease progression. Serum AS1402 levels were measured at 
      multiple times after i.v. administration. Human anti-human antibody (HAHA) 
      responses were measured to determine the immunogenicity of AS1402. 
      Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters were determined and were used to 
      assess dose dependency across the dose range studied. RESULTS: Twenty-six 
      patients were treated. AS1402 was generally well tolerated. Two grade 3/4 
      drug-related adverse events were reported, both at the 3-mg/kg dose. Neither was 
      observed in expanded or subsequent dosing cohorts. No anti-human antibodies were 
      detected. Plasma concentrations of AS1402 appeared to be proportional to dose 
      within the 1- to 16-mg/kg dose range assessed, with a mean terminal half-life of 
      115.4 +/- 37.1 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated iv administration of AS1402 was well 
      tolerated, with a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) exceeding 16 mg/kg, the highest 
      dose administered in this study. The half-life and exposure of AS1402 were such 
      that weekly dosing could achieve plasma concentrations corresponding to the 
      maximal ADCC activity observed in vitro. A phase II study is ongoing to evaluate 
      the clinical activity of AS1402 in patients with advanced breast cancer. TRIAL

      tissue samples; 42 fibroadenoma (FA), 23 nonproliferative benign diseases (NPF), 
      25 usual epithelial hyperplasia (UEH), 7 atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), and 
      27 breast normal tissues. An immunohistochemical approach was adopted, using the 
      following antibodies: reactive with MUC1 variable number of tandem repeats (C595, 
      HMFG2, and SM3 monoclonal antibodies), anti-MUC1-cytoplasmic tail polyclonal 
      antibody (CT33), and anti-carbohydrate antigens (sialyl Lewis x, Lewis x, Lewis 
      y, Tn, and Thomsen-Friedenreich epitopes). Positive area of reaction, intensity, 
      and pattern of expression were considered. A reactivity index was calculated as 
      intensity (I) x 100+percentage of positive area (A). Statistical analysis 
      comprised frequency analysis, P < 0.05, analysis of variance, and multiple 
      correlation with principal component analysis. All samples expressed MUC1, 
      detected by at least one anti-MUC1 antibody whereas Lewis x was the carbohydrate 
      antigen most frequently found in all groups whereas variable number of tandem 
      repeats MUC1 and Lewis x showed the highest correlation: 93% of normal samples, 
      62.5% of NPF, 87% of FA, 85% of UEH, and finally 80% of ADH. Although principal 
      component analysis using reactivity indexes explained only 39% of data 
      variability, normal samples appeared grouped and separated from benign breast 
      diseases, which remained spread. Thomsen-Friedenreich was the only antigen that 
      showed an increased tendency for positive expression and intensity from NPF 
      through FA, UEH to ADH, whereas it was not detected in normals. With respect to 
      the pattern of expression, an apical pattern was predominantly found in all the 
      groups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is a common, highly lethal disease with a rising 
      incidence. MUC1 is a tumor-associated antigen that is over-expressed in 
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Active immunotherapy that targets MUC1 could have 
      great treatment value. Here we investigated the preventive and therapeutic effect 
      of a MUC1 DNA vaccine on the pancreatic cancer. METHODS: MUC1-various tandem 
      repeat units(VNTR) DNA vaccine was produced by cloning one repeat of VNTR and 
      inserting the cloned gene into the pcDNA3.1. In the preventive group, female 
      C57BL/6 mice were immunized with the vaccine, pcDNA3.1 or PBS; and challenged 
      with panc02-MUC1 or panc02 cell. In the therapeutic group the mice were 
      challenged with panc02-MUC1 or panc02 cell, and then immunized with the vaccine, 
      pcDNA3.1 or PBS. The tumor size and the survival time of the animals were 
      compared between these groups. RESULTS: The DNA vaccine pcDNA3.1-VNTR could raise 
      cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity specific for MUC1. In the preventive 
      experiment, the mice survival time was significantly longer in the vaccine group 
      than in the control groups (P < 0.05). In the therapeutic experiment, the DNA 
      vaccine prolonged the survival time of the panc02-MUC1-bearing mice (P < 0.05). 
      In both the preventive and therapeutic experiments, the tumor size was 
      significantly less in the vaccine group than in the control groups (P < 0.05). 
      This pcDNA3.1-VNTR vaccine, however, could not prevent the mice attacked by 
      panc02 cells and had no therapeutic effect on the mice attacked by panc02 cells. 
      CONCLUSION: The MUC1 DNA vaccine pcDNA3.1-VNTR could induce a significant 
      MUC1-specific CTL response; and had both prophylactic and therapeutic effect on 
      panc02-MUC1 tumors. This vaccine might be used as a new adjuvant strategy against 
      pancreatic cancer.

TI  - MUC1 and estrogen receptor alpha gene polymorphisms in dry eye patients.
PG  - 334-8
LID - 10.1016/j.exer.2008.05.019 [doi]
AB  - Dry eye syndrome is a collection of common disorders of multifactorial etiology. 
      Although the epidemiology of dry eye has been well studied, reports of genetic 
      patterns that might influence susceptibility to dry eye are few. We reported that 
      the frequency of non-Sjogren's aqueous-deficient dry eye patients expressing only 
      the MUC1/A splice variant of the mucin MUC1 may be lower than that of a normal 
      control group [Imbert, Y., Darling, D.S., Jumblatt, M.M., Foulks, G.N., Couzin, 
      E.G., Steele, P.S., Young, W.W., Jr., 2006. MUC1 splice variants in human ocular 
      surface tissues: possible differences between dry eye patients and normal 
      controls. Exp. Eye Res. 83, 493-501]. Also, He et al. [He, Y., Li, X., Bao, Y., 
      Sun, J., Liu, J., 2006. The correlation of polymorphism of estrogen receptor gene 
      to dry eye syndrome in postmenopausal women. Yan. Ke. Xue. Bao. 22, 233-236] 
      reported a difference between Chinese dry eye and control groups in the frequency 
      of a polymorphism in estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha). In the present study we 
      determined the statistical significance and generality of these observations and 
      tested if the MUC1 splice variant difference between subject groups reflected a 
      difference in the MUC1 variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) size class. There 
      was a perfect correlation between the MUC1/A or MUC1/B splice variant pattern and 
      the SNP genotype frequency of the SNP (rs4072037) controlling that splicing 
      event. In contrast, western and Southern blotting indicated that MUC1 VNTR size 
      class corresponded to the MUC1 SNP genotype in only 80% of cases. We determined 
      the status of the MUC1 SNP in normal and dry eye populations all of whom were 
      female Caucasians. The MUC1 SNP genotype frequency of the normal control group 
      was statistically different from both the non-Sjogren's aqueous-deficient dry eye 
      group with ocular surface staining (P=0.017) and the evaporative dry eye group 
      (P=0.015). We also tested SNP rs2234693 to analyze the polymorphism in the 
      ERalpha gene and found no significant difference in the SNP genotype frequency 
      between the control group and either of the dry eye subtypes. Thus, among 
      Caucasians there is no evidence for an association of the ERalpha gene 
      polymorphism with dry eye syndrome as previously described in a Chinese 
      population. In conclusion, the etiologies of evaporative dry eye and 
      non-Sjogren's aqueous-deficient dry eye are known to be different. However, our 
      results suggest that both of these subtypes of dry eye disease may share a common 
      mechanism or factor related to MUC1 genotypic differences that affects 
      susceptibility to ocular surface damage. This altered susceptibility may not be 
      related to the MUC1 VNTR size class. Therefore, mechanisms influencing protection 
      of the ocular surface against inflammation and damage in different types of dry 
      eye disease warrant further investigation particularly in relation to MUC1 
      genotype.

TI  - PAM4-reactive MUC1 is a biomarker for early pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
PG  - 7380-7
AB  - PURPOSE: The anti-MUC1 monoclonal antibody (MAb), PAM4, has a high specificity 
      for pancreatic adenocarcinoma compared with other cancers, normal tissues, or 
      pancreatitis. In order to assess its role in early pancreatic cancer development, 
      we examined the expression of the PAM4-reactive MUC1 in the noninvasive precursor 
      lesions, pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) and intraductal papillary 
      mucinous neoplasia (IPMN). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Tissue microarrays prepared from 
      formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens were assessed by immunohistology for 
      expression of the PAM4-reactive, non-variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR), 
      MUC1 epitope, and the VNTR epitope bound by the MA5 MAb. RESULTS: The 
      PAM4-reactive MUC1 epitope was not detected in normal pancreas but was expressed 
      in 87% (48 of 55) of invasive pancreatic adenocarcinomas, including early stage 1 
      disease: PAM4 labeled 94% (44 of 47) of the earliest PanIN lesions, PanIN-1A and 
      1B, along with 91% (10 of 11) of PanIN-2, 40% (2 of 5) of PanIN-3, and 86% (31 of 
      36) of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia lesions. A mostly diffuse pattern 
      of labeling was observed. A second, unrelated, anti-MUC1 MAb, MA5, showed 
      considerably less sensitivity with early PanIN-1 lesions; only 61% (25 of 41) 
      were positive and the labeling did not differentiate normal pancreas from PanINs. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that expression of the PAM4-reactive antigen may 
      represent an early event in the development of invasive pancreatic 
      adenocarcinoma, and is unrelated to the VNTR peptide core epitopes of MUC1. 
      Detection of this biomarker using immunohistology, in vitro immunoassays, and in 
      vivo antibody-based imaging may provide new opportunities for the early detection 
      and improved diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.

TI  - Generation of MUC1-stimulated mononuclear cells using optimized conditions.
PG  - 24-9
AB  - Mucin is a glycoprotein found on the surface of cell membranes of 
      adenocarcinomas. The purpose of these studies was to generate MUC1 multiple 
      tandem repeat (VNTR)-stimulated mononuclear cells (M1SMC). We first determined 
      the optimal conditions to influence the immune response. In these studies, 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), from patients with adenocarcinomas, 
      were stimulated by different numbers of M1SMC stimulations, various 
      concentrations of MUC1 peptide, washing of PBMC prior to stimulation and days in 
      culture, to determine the optimal conditions to influence the immune response. 
      The results of this study indicate that the mononuclear cells (MC) stimulated 
      twice 1 week apart with MUC1 VNTR1 produced a greater specific killing of the 
      breast cancer cell line MCF-7 than the 0, 1, 3 or 4 weekly stimulations. The 
      optimal molarity for inducing cytotoxicity and cytokines (granulocyte macrophage 
      colony-stimulating factor, gamma-interferon and interleukin-10) was 45 x 10(-8) M 
      (1 microg/ml); except for tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha which was 22 x 
      10(-8) M (0.5 microg/ml). The unwashed MC were superior to washing them with 
      Ficoll-Hypaque. The optimal number of days in culture for cytotoxicity and 
      cytokine production was after two stimulations (i.e. after day 7). Optimum 
      conditions for generation of M1SMC identified in these studies were two 
      stimulations with peptide, concentration of 45 x 10(-8) M (1 microg/ml) peptide, 
      unwashed cells, and after two stimulations or after 8 days in culture. M1SMC were 
      generated from multiple patients with breast cancer which lysed adenocarcinoma 
      cells.

PG  - 10222-9
AB  - Perineural invasion in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, a common pathologic phenomenon 
      whereby cancer cells invade and intimately contact the endoneurium of pancreatic 
      nerves, is thought to contribute to both pain and local disease recurrence. MUC1, 
      a type I transmembrane mucin that can affect the adhesive properties of cells, 
      contains a large extracellular tandem repeat domain, which is heavily 
      glycosylated in normal epithelia, but is overexpressed and differentially 
      glycosylated in pancreatic cancer. This altered glycosylation includes the 
      shortened core I O-glycans for monosialyl and disialyl T antigens. 
      Myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), a membrane-bound protein expressed on 
      oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells, binds myelin to neurons. MAG's preferred 
      ligands are derivatives of the monosialyl and disialyl T antigen. We investigated 
      whether MUC1 is a counter-receptor for MAG and if their interaction contributed 
      to pancreatic perineural invasion. Results showed that MAG binds pancreatic cells 
      expressing MUC1, that this binding is sialidase-sensitive, and that MAG 
      physically associates with MUC1. Heterotypic adhesion assays between pancreatic 
      cancer cells and Schwann cells revealed that increased expression of MUC1 or MAG 
      enhanced adhesion. Conversely, specific inhibition of MAG or sialyl-T MUC1 
      partially blocked adhesion. Immunohistochemical analysis of pancreatic perineural 
      invasion showed the expression of both MUC1 and MAG. These results support the 
      hypothesis that the adhesive interactions between MUC1 and MAG are of biological 
      significance in pancreatic cancer perineural invasion.

TI  - DNA aptamers against the MUC1 tumour marker: design of aptamer-antibody sandwich 
      ELISA for the early diagnosis of epithelial tumours.
PG  - 1039-50
AB  - Aptamers are functional molecules able to bind tightly and selectively to disease 
      markers, offering great potential for applications in disease diagnosis and 
      therapy. MUC1 is a well-known tumour marker present in epithelial malignancies 
      and is used in immunotherapeutic and diagnostic approaches. We report the 
      selection of DNA aptamers that bind with high affinity and selectivity an MUC1 
      recombinant protein containing five repeats of the variable tandem repeat region. 
      Aptamers were selected using the SELEX methodology from an initial library 
      containing a 25-base-long variable region for their ability to bind to the 
      unglycosylated form of the MUC1 protein. After ten rounds of in vitro selection 
      and amplification, more than 90% of the pool of sequences consisted of 
      target-binding molecules, which were cloned, sequenced and found to share no 
      sequence consensus. The binding properties of these aptamers were quantified 
      using ELISA and surface plasmon resonance. The lead aptamer sequence was 
      subsequently used in the design of an aptamer-antibody hybrid sandwich ELISA for 
      the identification and quantification of MUC1 in buffered solutions. Following 
      optimisation of the operating conditions, the resulting enzyme immunoassay 
      displayed an EC50 value of 25 microg/ml, a detection limit of 1 microg/ml and a 
      linear range between 8 and 100 microg/ml for the MUC1 five tandem repeat analyte. 
      In addition, recovery studies performed in buffer conditions resulted in averaged 
      recoveries between 98.2 and 101.7% for all spiked samples, demonstrating the 
      usability of the aptamer as a receptor in microtitre-based assays. Our results 
      aim towards the formation of new diagnostic assays against this tumour marker for 
      the early diagnosis of primary or metastatic disease in breast, bladder and other 
      epithelial tumours.

TI  - No evidence of association of MUC-1 genetic polymorphism with embryo implantation 
      failure.
PG  - 793-7
AB  - Pregnancy loss can be caused by several factors involved in human reproduction. 
      Although up to 50% of cases remain unexplained, it has been postulated that the 
      major cause of failed pregnancy is an error of embryo implantation. Transmembrane 
      mucin-1 (MUC-1) is a glycoprotein expressed on the endometrial cell surface which 
      acts as a barrier to implantation. The gene that codes for this molecule is 
      composed of a polymorphic tandem repeat of 60 nucleotides. Our objective was to 
      determine if MUC-1 genetic polymorphism is associated with implantation failure 
      in patients with a history of recurrent abortion. The study was conducted on 10 
      women aged 25 to 35 years with no history of successful pregnancy and with a 
      diagnosis of infertility. The control group consisted of 32 patients aged 25 to 
      35 years who had delivered at least two full-term live children and who had no 
      history of abortions or fetal losses. MUC-1 amplicons were obtained by PCR and 
      observed on agarose and polyacrylamide gel after electrophoresis. Statistical 
      analysis showed no significant difference in the number of MUC-1 variable number 
      of tandem repeats between these groups (P > 0.05). Our results suggest that there 
      is no effect of the polymorphic MUC-1 sequence on the implantation failure. 
      However, the data do not exclude MUC-1 relevance during embryo implantation. The 
      process is related to several associated factors such as the mechanisms of gene 
      expression in the uterus, specific MUC-1 post-translational modifications and 
      appropriate interactions with other molecules during embryo implantation.

TI  - Context of MUC1 epitope: immunogenicity.
PG  - 453-6
AB  - MUC1 is a glycoprotein found at the secretory poles of normal cells but is 
      hypoglycosylated on the entire surface of cell membranes of adenocarcinomas. In 
      order to determine the influence on the immune response of peptide context for 
      epitope presentation, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients 
      with adenocarcinomas, were stimulated with MUC1 peptides derived from the 20 
      amino acids (aa) long sequence that is characteristic of the MUC1 Variable Number 
      of Tandem Repeats (VNTR). In the seven peptides tested, the T-cell tumor-specific 
      epitope (cTSE) was surrounded by variable numbers of aa and repeated up to 5 
      times in the same peptide. The results of this study indicate that cultures 
      stimulated with peptide 610 (GSTAPPAHGVTS APDTRPAP) showed the highest specific 
      killing of the MUC1-expressing breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Peptide 610 is also 
      superior to the other peptides in inducing better production of the type 1 
      cytokines, tissue necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma. In conclusion, 
      context of the epitope and not sequence alone determines immunogenicity.

TI  - Identification of a novel cancer-specific immunodominant glycopeptide epitope in 
      the MUC1 tandem repeat.
PG  - 197-209
AB  - The cell membrane mucin MUC1 is over-expressed and aberrantly glycosylated in 
      many cancers, and cancer-associated MUC1 glycoforms represent potential targets 
      for immunodiagnostic and therapeutic measures. We have recently shown that MUC1 
      with GalNAcalpha1-O-Ser/Thr (Tn) and NeuAcalpha2-6GalNAcalpha1-O-Ser/Thr (STn) 
      O-glycosylation is a cancer-specific glycoform, and that Tn/STn-MUC1 
      glycopeptide-based vaccines can override tolerance in human MUC1 transgenic mice 
      and induce humoral immunity with high specificity for MUC1 cancer-specific 
      glycoforms (Sorensen AL, Reis CA, Tarp MA, Mandel U, Ramachandran K, 
      Sankaranarayanan V, Schwientek T, Graham R, Taylor-Papadimitriou J, Hollingsworth 
      MA, et al. 2006. Chemoenzymatically synthesized multimeric Tn/STn MUC1 
      glycopeptides elicit cancer-specific anti-MUC1 antibody responses and override 
      tolerance. Glycobiology. 16:96-107). In order to further characterize the immune 
      response to Tn/STn-MUC1 glycoforms, we generated monoclonal antibodies with 
      specificity similar to the polyclonal antibody response found in transgenic mice. 
      In the present study, we define the immunodominant epitope on Tn/STn-MUC1 
      glycopeptides to the region including the amino acids GSTA of the MUC1 20-amino 
      acid tandem repeat (HGVTSAPDTRPAPGSTAPPA). Most other MUC1 antibodies are 
      directed to the PDTR region, although patients with antibodies to the GSTA region 
      have been identified. A panel of other MUC1 glycoform-specific monoclonal 
      antibodies was included for comparison. The study demonstrates that the GSTA 
      region of the MUC1 tandem repeat contains a highly immunodominant epitope when 
      presented with immature short O-glycans. The cancer-specific expression of this 
      glycopeptide epitope makes it a prime candidate for immunodiagnostic and 
      therapeutic measures.

TI  - A new competitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (MRP83-CA15-3) for MUC1 
      measurement in breast cancer.
PG  - 139-49
AB  - A new competitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was developed in this study. 
      Monoclonal antibody (PR81) against the tandem repeat of the core protein was 
      prepared, characterized, purified, and conjugated to HRP. This antibody exhibited 
      no cross reactions with proteins such as bovine serum albumin, keyhole limpet 
      homocyanin, human serum albumin, casein, human milk fat globin (HMFG), and 
      peptone. The native cancerous MUC1 protein was purified from ascites fluid of a 
      patient suffering from small cell lung carcinoma by immunoaffinity chromatography 
      and used as a standard preparation in the assay buffer. The standard curve was 
      constructed following a competitive procedure in the range of 0-200 U/mL. The 
      level of MUC1 in normal and cancerous samples was compared following this 
      procedure and using available CA15-3 EIA (Can Ag), as well as LIAISON CA15-3 
      commercial kits. The correlation coefficient between the procedure reported in 
      this work (MRP83-CA15-3) and CA15-3 EIA (Can Ag) was 0.68 and was 0.95 with the 
      LIAISON CA15-3 kit. We concluded that the present assay can detect MUC1 in breast 
      cancer patients with great sensitivity and accuracy.

TI  - MUC1 splice variants in human ocular surface tissues: possible differences 
      between dry eye patients and normal controls.
PG  - 493-501
AB  - Mucins are highly glycosylated proteins that are vital to the maintenance of 
      healthy epithelial surfaces including the ocular surface. Mucins act as 
      lubricants, protectants, and mediators of signal transduction. The majority of 
      the O-glycosylation sites on the transmembrane mucin MUC1 are found in a highly 
      polymorphic core region containing a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR). 
      MUC1 alleles can be divided into size classes that contain small (30-45) or large 
      (60-90) numbers of repeats. Although at least 12 splice variants of MUC1 have 
      been found in other tissues, no splice variants have been reported in human 
      ocular surface tissues. We have used RT-PCR to identify MUC1 splice variants that 
      were then confirmed by sequencing. We here report the presence in some samples of 
      human cornea, conjunctiva, and lacrimal gland of MUC1/B which features canonical 
      splicing between exons 1 and 2 and MUC1/A, a transcript that retains 27bp from 
      the 3' end of intron 1 and is predicted to add 9 amino acids to the MUC1 sequence 
      upstream of the tandem repeat region. Cornea and conjunctiva both contain the 
      MUC1/SEC splice variant that lacks the transmembrane domain and, therefore, 
      results in a soluble, secreted form of MUC1. Cornea and conjunctiva also contain 
      MUC1/Y and MUC1/Z(X) variants that lack the tandem repeat region. Cornea, 
      conjunctiva, and lacrimal gland also contain a previously undescribed MUC1 
      variant transcript, termed MUC1/YI, that retains 99bp from the 5' end and 27bp 
      from the 3' end of the first intron, resulting in a frame shift and premature 
      stop codon. This transcript is predicted to produce a novel 27 amino acid peptide 
      after signal peptidase cleavage. Analysis of brush cytology samples revealed that 
      the percentage of dry eye patients expressing the MUC1/A variant in the 
      conjunctival epithelium is lower than in normal control donors. Western blotting 
      confirmed that MUC1/A is associated with alleles containing the large size class 
      of tandem repeats. Therefore, we propose that one factor in susceptibility to dry 
      eye disease may be the lengths of the MUC1 VNTR in conjunctival epithelium based 
      on the rationale that longer VNTR provide better lubrication and greater 
      protection of the ocular surface against inflammation.

TI  - The production and characterization of novel heavy-chain antibodies against the 
      tandem repeat region of MUC1 mucin.
PG  - 431-52
AB  - Camelidae are known to produce immunoglobulins (Igs) devoid of light chains and 
      constant heavy-chain domains (CH1). Antigen-specific fragments of these 
      heavy-chain IgGs (VHH) are of great interest in biotechnology applications. This 
      paper describes the first example of successfully raised heavy-chain antibodies 
      in Camelus dromedarius (single-humped camel) and Camelus bactrianus (two-humped 
      camel) against a MUC1 related peptide that is found to be an important epitope 
      expressed in cancerous tissue. Camels were immunized against a synthetic peptide 
      corresponding to the tandem repeat region of MUC1 mucin and cancerous tissue 
      preparation obtained from patients suffering from breast carcinoma. Three IgG 
      subclasses with different binding properties to protein A and G were purified by 
      affinity chromatography. Both conventional and heavy-chain IgG antibodies were 
      produced in response to MUC1-related peptide. The elicited antibodies could react 
      specifically with the tandem repeat region of MUC1 mucin in an enzyme linked 
      immunosorbant assay (ELISA). Anti-peptide antibodies were purified after passing 
      antiserum over two affinity chromatography columns. Using ELISA, 
      immunocytochemistry and Western blotting, the interaction of purified antibodies 
      with different antigens was evaluated. The antibodies were observed to be 
      selectively bound to antigens namely: MUC1 peptide (tandem repeat region), human 
      milk fat globule membrane (HMFG), deglycosylated human milk fat globule membrane 
      (D-HMFG), homogenized cancerous breast tissue and a native MUC1 purified from 
      ascitic fluid. Ka values of specific polyclonal antipeptide antibodies were 
      estimated in C. dromedarius and C. bactrianus, as 7 x 10(10) M(-1) and 1.4 x 
      10(10) M(-1) respectively.

TI  - MUC1 peptide vaccination in patients with advanced pancreas or biliary tract 
      cancer.
PG  - 3575-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate the immunogenicity of MUC1 peptide vaccine in advanced 
      pancreatic and bile duct cancers, a phase I clinical trial was conducted. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 100-mer MUC1 peptide consisting of the extracellular 
      tandem repeat domain and incomplete Freund's adjuvant were subcutaneously 
      administered to 6 pancreatic and 3 bile duct cancer patients at weeks 1, 3 and 5 
      and doses ranging from 300 to 3000 microg. Circulating intracytoplasmic 
      cytokine-positive CD4+ T cells and anti-MUC1 IgG antibodies were measured before 
      and after vaccination. RESULTS: There were no adverse events, except for mild 
      reddening and swelling at the vaccination site. In 8 patients eligible for 
      clinical evaluation, 7 had progressive disease and 1 stable disease with a 
      tendency for increased circulating anti-MUC1 IgG antibody after vaccination. 
      CONCLUSION: This phase I clinical trial revealed the safety of a vaccine 
      containing 100-mer MUC1 peptides and incomplete Freund's adjuvant.

TI  - Mucin based breast cancer vaccines.
PG  - 1865-77
AB  - Of the 8 human epithelial mucins identified so far, MUC1 has been the focus of 
      attention for immunotherapeutic applications. The gene MUC1 encodes a large 
      membrane associated glycoprotein where the majority of the extracellular domain 
      is made up of tandem repeats of 20 amino acids. In breast cancer MUC1 is 
      up-regulated and as a result of changes in glycosyl transferases, the complex 
      carbohydrate side-chains are shortened leading to the exposure of novel peptide 
      and carbohydrate epitopes. Cellular and humoral immune responses to MUC1 have 
      been documented in benign and malignant breast disease and in some circumstances, 
      T-cell responses to MUC1 may not depend on presentation by the major 
      histocompatibility complex. Several immunogens based on MUC1 are being 
      investigated for the immunotherapy of breast cancer in model systems and in the 
      clinic. These include cell lines that express MUC1, either given alone or fused 
      with professional antigen presenting cells. Approaches that may prove more 
      feasible in the clinic include the use of peptide epitopes, usually from the 
      tandem repeat of the extracellular domain, given either with conventional 
      immunological adjuvants or coupled to mannan (a polysaccharide also known as 
      polymannose), which may target uptake of peptide into antigen presenting cells. 
      Cellular and humoral immune responses to these immunogens have been noted in 
      patients with advanced malignancy. Targeting of peptide epitopes may also be 
      achieved using antibodies to MUC1 through the idiotype network. Use of antibodies 
      to MUC1 has been associated with a survival benefit for patients with ovarian 
      cancer, but prospective studies are awaited. The use of cDNA encoding MUC1 may 
      allow endogenous processing of antigen and thus augment immunogenicity. Phase I 
      studies using the vaccinia virus as a vector have been completed and Phase II 
      studies have begun. Studies examining the potential role of carbohydrate antigens 
      have suggested that the ability to generate a specific immune response may 
      influence survival of patients with metastatic epithelial malignancies. Again, 
      these findings will be tested in the Phase III setting. While examining the 
      potential role of immunogens based on MUC1, it is also necessary to understand 
      the nature of immunosuppression in patients with advanced malignancy in order to 
      develop strategies to enhance the immunogenicity of potential cancer vaccines.

TI  - Polymorphism of the MUC1 mucin gene is associated with susceptibility to lung 
      adenocarcinoma and poor prognosis.
PG  - 185-9
AB  - MUC1 is a highly glycosylated glycoprotein that is often overexpressed in 
      adenocarcinomas. MUC1 has molecular diversity because of a variable number of 
      tandem repeats (from 25-125 repeats) in the extracellular domain of its core 
      protein. MUC1 plays an important role in facilitating invasion and metastasis of 
      malignant cells, and it also inhibits anti-cancer immune activity against 
      malignant cells. We hypothesize that MUC1 allele length polymorphism (variable 
      number of tandem repeats) is associated with development of lung adenocarcinoma. 
      We evaluated MUC1 gene polymorphism using Southern blot analysis of peripheral 
      blood from patients with non-small cell lung cancer (n=56), patients with benign 
      respiratory disease (n=52), and healthy volunteers (n=52). We found that large 
      MUC1 allele length was significantly associated with lung adenocarcinoma but not 
      with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Adenocarcinoma patients with a 
      homozygous large MUC1 genotype had a worse prognosis than patients with a 
      heterozygous (large + small) MUC1 genotype or a homozygous small MUC1 genotype. 
      These results suggest that the large MUC1 allele is associated with 
      susceptibility to lung adenocarcinoma and poor prognosis.

TI  - Sequence-variant repeats of MUC1 show higher conformational flexibility, are less 
      densely O-glycosylated and induce differential B lymphocyte responses.
PG  - 735-46
AB  - The human epithelial cancer mucin MUC1 is able to break tolerance and to induce 
      humoral immune responses in healthy subjects and in cancer patients. We recently 
      showed that clusters of sequence-variant repeats are interspersed in the repeat 
      domain of MUC1 at high frequency, which should contribute to the structural and 
      immunological features of the mucin. Here we elucidated the potential effects 
      exerted by sequence-variant repeats on their O-glycosylation. Evidence from in 
      vitro glycosylation with polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases GalNAc-T1 
      and GalNAc-T2 in concert with mass spectrometric analyses of in vivo glycosylated 
      MUC1 probes from transiently transfected HEK293 cells indicated reduced 
      glycosylation densities of repeats with three concerted replacements: 
      AHGVTSAPESRPAPGSTAPA. The Pro to Ala replacement in STAPA exerts not only 
      proximal effects on the ppGalNAc-T2 preferred site at -3 and -4, but also more 
      distant effects on the ppGalNAc-T1 preferred site at -15 (TSAPESRPAPGSTAPA). We 
      also examined the conformational changes of MUC1 glycopeptides induced by the 
      concerted DT to ES replacements and revealed a higher conformational flexibility 
      of ES/P peptides compared to DT/P peptides. Differences in conformational 
      flexibilities and in O-glycosylation densities could underlie the observed 
      differential humoral responses in humans. We were able to show that the natural 
      immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses to the repeat domain of MUC1 in sera from 
      nonmalignant control subjects are preferentially directed to variant repeat 
      clusters. In contrast, the IgG response in patients with adenocarcinoma shifted 
      to higher frequencies of preferential DTR peptide binding.

TI  - Responses of human T cells to peptides flanking the tandem repeat and overlapping 
      the signal sequence of MUC1.
PG  - 760-8
AB  - The epithelial mucin MUC1 is one of the few tumour-associated antigens identified 
      for breast cancer. Several MUC1-derived peptides binding HLA-A*0201 molecules 
      have been identified that correspond to sequences outside the tandem repeat. 
      Immunisation with some of these peptides induces protective antitumour immunity 
      in mice. Another HLA-A*0201-binding peptide has been identified in a human 
      system. We have evaluated the CD8(+) T-cell responses to all these peptides using 
      peripheral blood lymphocytes from breast cancer patients and normal donors. 
      Specific CD8(+) T-cell responses could be generated in vitro against some of 
      these peptides but only after several rounds of in vitro restimulation, and they 
      did not recognise human cells endogenously expressing the antigen. Nevertheless, 
      T cells recognised by HLA-A*0201 tetramers carrying a peptide from the signal 
      sequence (LLLLTVLTV) could be detected in the peripheral blood of some 
      HLA-A*0201(+) breast cancer patients but not in healthy adults. This peptide is 
      the only one of those tested which was identified in the human system, and the 
      results emphasize the potential problems involved in translation of data from 
      laboratory animal models to the human system.

TI  - Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen expression in gastric carcinomas is associated with 
      MUC1 mucin VNTR polymorphism.
PG  - 511-7
AB  - Aberrant glycosylation of mucins is a common phenomenon associated with oncogenic 
      transformation. We investigated the association between expression of the 
      tumor-associated antigens T, Tn, and sialyl-Tn and polymorphism in the length of 
      the MUC1 mucin tandem repeat in a series of gastric carcinomas. We further 
      evaluated the relevance of MUC1 tandem repeat length on the expression of these 
      tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens (TACAs) using a gastric carcinoma cell 
      line model expressing recombinant MUC1 constructs carrying 0, 3, 9, and 42 
      repeats. Gastric carcinomas showed a high prevalence of Tn and sialyl-Tn 
      antigens, whereas T antigen was less frequently expressed. The expression of T 
      antigen was significantly higher in gastric carcinomas from patients homozygous 
      for MUC1 large tandem repeat alleles. No significant associations were found for 
      Tn and sialyl-Tn antigens. This novel association was reinforced by the gastric 
      carcinoma cell line model experiments, where de novo expression of T antigen was 
      detected in clones transfected with larger VNTR regions. Our results indicate 
      that polymorphism in the MUC1 tandem repeat influences the expression of TACAs in 
      gastric cancer cells and may therefore allow the identification of subgroups of 
      patients that develop more aggressive tumors expressing T antigen.

TI  - MUC1 gene-derived glycoprotein assays for monitoring breast cancer (CA 15-3, CA 
      27.29, BR): are they measuring the same antigen?
PG  - 1131-5
AB  - CONTEXT: There are 2 general types of assays measuring MUC1 gene-derived 
      glycoprotein: assays for cancer antigen (CA) 15-3, which are sandwich assays, and 
      assays for CA 27.29, which are competitive assays. These 2 types of assays 
      measure slightly different parts of this tandem-repeat molecule. Across-method 
      assay differences hinder the exchange of patient test values among integrated 
      health care networks and among countries. OBJECTIVE: This report evaluates the 
      method differences among these assays to determine if the differences between 
      these assays are mainly related to variations in calibration or differences in 
      analyte specificity. DESIGN: Data from 22 College of American Pathologists survey 
      challenges were analyzed to compare 10 commercial assay methods for these 2 
      related analytes. In addition, data from 58 patient samples were analyzed to 
      compare 3 of these assays. RESULTS: The linear correlation coefficients comparing 
      the within-method medians of these proficiency test distributions were very high 
      (>0.99) for all of the methods; however, the regression slopes varied from 0.836 
      to 1.095. The regression slopes for the patient specimens varied similarly, but 
      the correlation coefficients were lower. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that 
      many of the test value differences for these measurements are due to differences 
      in assay calibration rather than differences in the specificity of the assay 
      measurement systems. Survey test data potentially could be used to help harmonize 
      these assay differences.

TI  - Binding patterns of DTR-specific antibodies reveal a glycosylation-conditioned 
      tumor-specific epitope of the epithelial mucin (MUC1).
PG  - 681-92
AB  - Glycosylation determines essential biological functions of epithelial mucins in 
      health and disease. We report on the influence of glycosylation of the 
      immunodominant DTR motif of MUC1 on its antigenicity. Sets of novel glycopeptides 
      were synthesized that enabled us to examine sole and combined effects of peptide 
      length (number of repeats) and O-glycosylation with GalNAc at the DTR motif on 
      the binding patterns of 22 monoclonal antibodies recognizing this motif. In case 
      of unglycosylated peptides almost all antibodies bound better to multiple MUC1 
      tandem repeats. Glycosylation at the DTR led to enhanced binding in 11 cases, 
      whereas 10 antibodies were not influenced in binding, and one was inhibited. In 
      nine of the former cases both length and DTR glycosylation were additive in their 
      influence on antibody binding, suggesting that both effects are different. 
      Improved binding to the glycosylated DTR motif was exclusively found with 
      antibodies generated against tumor-derived MUC1. Based on these data a 
      tumor-specific MUC1 epitope is defined comprising the ...PDTRP... sequence in a 
      particular conformation essentially determined by O-glycosylation at its 
      threonine with either GalNAcalpha1 or a related short glycan. The results can 
      find application in the field of MUC1-based immunotherapy.

TI  - A human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitope and its agonist epitope from the 
      nonvariable number of tandem repeat sequence of MUC-1.
PG  - 2139-49
AB  - PURPOSE: MUC-1/DF-3 remains an attractive target for vaccine therapy. It is 
      overexpressed in the majority of human carcinomas and multiple myeloma. Clinical 
      trials using MUC-1-based vaccines have demonstrated safety, clinical responses, 
      and the induction of T-cell responses directed against MUC-1. Previous studies in 
      experimental models and in clinical trials have demonstrated that altering the 
      amino acid sequence of a "self" epitope can lead to the generation of an enhancer 
      agonist epitope capable of eliciting stronger T-cell responses than the native 
      epitope can. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND RESULTS: We describe here the identification 
      of six novel class I HLA-A2 epitopes of MUC-1 that reside outside of the variable 
      number of tandem repeat region. Each is shown to have the ability to activate 
      human T cells as measured by IFN-gamma production. One epitope (ATWGQDVTSV, at 
      amino acid position 92-101 and designated P-92), which demonstrated the highest 
      level of binding to HLA-A2 and which induced the highest level of IFN-gamma in 
      human T cells, was further studied for the generation of potential enhancer 
      agonist epitopes. Of four potential agonists identified, one epitope (ALWGQDVTSV, 
      designated P-93L) was identified as an enhancer agonist. Compared with the native 
      P-92 peptide, the P-93L agonist (a). bound HLA-A2 at lower peptide 
      concentrations, (b). demonstrated a higher avidity for HLA-A2 in dissociation 
      assays, (c). when used with antigen-presenting cells, induced the production of 
      more IFN-gamma by T cells than with the use of the native peptide, and (d). was 
      capable of more efficiently generating MUC-1-specific human T-cell lines from 
      normal volunteers and pancreatic cancer patients. Most importantly, the T-cell 
      lines generated using the agonist epitope were more efficient than those 
      generated with the native epitope in the lysis of targets pulsed with the native 
      epitope and in the lysis of HLA-A2 human tumor cells expressing MUC-1. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the identification of novel MUC-1 epitopes outside 
      the variable number of tandem repeat region, the studies reported here describe 
      the first agonist epitope of MUC-1. The employment of this agonist epitope in 
      peptide-, protein-, and vector-based vaccines may well aid in the development of 
      effective vaccines for a range of human cancers.

TI  - Ex vivo expansion of CD8+CD56+ and CD8+CD56- natural killer T cells specific for 
      MUC1 mucin.
PG  - 1171-80
AB  - Prostate cancers express MUC1, but nearly all metastatic cells lack HLA class I 
      molecules. Thus, a lymphocyte population that can sense its antigenic 
      environment, while also able to react to stimuli of natural killer (NK) cells, 
      may be a more versatile effector cell population for antitumor immune responses. 
      Herein, we report that tumor-specific MUC1 peptide, interleukin 2, and 
      interleukin 12 act synergistically to stimulate the ex vivo expansion of 
      CD8(+)CD56(-) T cells and CD8(+)CD56(+) natural killer T (NKT) cells from the 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells of prostate cancer patients, as well as 
      healthy male and female donors. Both the CD56(+) NKT cells and CD56(-) T cells 
      lysed allogeneic mucin-bearing target cells, as well as NK target cells, but not 
      lymphokine-activated killer target cells. However, the CD56(+) NKT cells 
      displayed a 2-fold greater cytolytic activity than the CD56(-) T cells. The 
      mucin-specific cytolytic activity and NK cytolytic activities for both lymphocyte 
      populations were independent of HLA class I and CD1 molecules. The CD56(-) T 
      cells up-regulated CD56 with continued antigenic stimulation in the presence of 
      interleukin 12, suggesting that CD8(+)CD56(-) T cells are NKT cells. However, 
      CD56(+) NKT cells expand poorly to continued stimulation. All mucin-stimulated 
      NKT cells exhibited the activated/memory CD45RO phenotype. The NKT cell lines 
      express the alpha/beta T-cell receptor (TCR). The TCR repertoire was limited and 
      varied with cell line, but was not the V alpha 24V beta 11 TCR typically 
      associated with NKT cells. Whereas CD161 is generally considered a marker of NKT 
      cells, the mucin-stimulated NKT cells did not express this marker. Thus, we have 
      described two phenotypically distinct NKT types that do not display a biased TCR 
      repertoire, but do display specificity for a tumor-specific peptide antigen 
      (CTL-like activity), as well as HLA class I-deficient target cells (NK-like 
      activity).

PG  - 379-84
AB  - The O-glycans that decorate mucin glycoproteins contribute to the biophysical and 
      biochemical properties of these molecules and hence their function as a barrier 
      and lubricant on epithelial surfaces. Alterations in mucin O-glycosylation in 
      certain diseases may contribute to pathology. It is known that both the host cell 
      type and the amino acid sequence of the mucin tandem repeat contribute to the 
      O-glycosylation of a mucin molecule. We expressed an epitope-tagged MUC1 mucin 
      cDNA construct in the airway cell line 16HBE14o- and the colon carcinoma cell 
      line Caco2 and used Fast Atom Bombardment Mass Spectrometry to evaluate the 
      contribution of the host cell to differences in O-glycosylation of a single 
      mucin. Many of the glycans detected on the MUC1 mucin were common to both cell 
      types, as would be predicted from biosynthetic constraints. However, MUC1 
      synthesized in the airway cell line showed comparatively low levels of 
      sialylation but carried a range of oligo-N-acetyllactosamine structures that were 
      not seen in the colon carcinoma cell line.

TI  - MUC1-like tandem repeat proteins are broadly immunogenic in cancer patients.
PG  - 3
AB  - The identification of antigens mediating tumor rejection is an important goal of 
      cancer immunology. The SEREX technology utilizes antibodies from cancer patients 
      to identify candidate antigens from tumor-derived cDNA expression libraries. 
      Using sera from a long-term surviving metastatic melanoma patient vaccinated with 
      irradiated, autologous tumor cells engineered to secrete granulocyte-macrophage 
      colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), we identified an antigen reported to be a 
      putative opioid growth factor receptor (OGFr). The human immune response to OGFr 
      exhibits three features shared with other tumor antigens. First, the protein is 
      an intracellular antigen found in both nucleus and cytoplasm. Second, part of the 
      antibody response is directed at a putative protein product encoded by an 
      alternative reading frame (ARF). Third, part of the antibody response is directed 
      at a portion of the molecule that bears a striking resemblance to the 
      extracellular domain of MUC1, both with respect to primary structure and size 
      polymorphism. Antibody responses to OGFr and a synthetic peptide representing a 
      putative alternative reading frame product (OGFr-ARF) were frequently found in 
      cancer patients. 11/45 (24%) melanoma patients had antibodies to OGFr and 5/45 
      (11%) had antibodies to OGFr-ARF. Moreover, 5/24 (21%) lung cancer, 4/25 (16%) 
      prostate cancer, and 5/6 breast or ovarian cancer patients had antibodies to 
      OGFr, the alternative frame product, or both. These data add to the growing list 
      of tumor antigens that appear to be translated in two frames, and suggest that 
      OGFr and OGFr-ARF may be useful targets for vaccination.

TI  - Developmental patterns of mucin gene expression in human fetal small intestinal 
      xenografts maintained in severe-combined immunodeficient mice.
PG  - 898-904
AB  - The lack of a suitable animal model that expresses human intestinal mucin genes 
      limits the study of mucin function. The aim of this study was to examine whether 
      human fetal intestinal xenografts, known to model host-restricted interactions 
      with human-specific pathogens, express mucin genes in an appropriate 
      developmental pattern when transplanted into severe-combined immunodeficient 
      (scid) mice. Expression profiles for eight mucin genes were examined in human 
      fetal ileal xenografts transplanted ectopically into scid mice for 10 wk. In situ 
      hybridization was performed on fetal, xenograft, and adult intestinal tissue 
      sections with 35S-labeled oligonucleotides specific to human tandem repeat 
      sequences for MUC1, MUC2, MUC3, MUC4, MUC5AC, MUC5B, MUC6, and MUC7. 
      Hybridization patterns observed with the MUC2, MUC3, MUC4, and MUC5AC probes 
      demonstrated that mucin gene expression in xenografted fetal intestine was 
      comparable to third trimester fetal and/or adult tissues. MUC2 and MUC5AC were 
      expressed in a developmental-specific fashion. MUC5AC, expressed in first and 
      early second trimester fetal bowel, was never detected in intestinal xenografts. 
      MUC2 expression displayed a late fetal and/or adult-type hybridization pattern. 
      MUC3 and MUC4 were not developmentally expressed. Appropriate developmental 
      regulation of known intestinal mucin genes was recorded in ectopically grafted 
      human fetal intestinal xenografts. Adult-like patterns of mucin gene expression 
      in this model system will permit future studies aimed at characterizing 
      cis/trans-acting factors that regulate mucin gene expression and function during 
      development, disease, and wound healing and also in mucin-pathogen interactions 
      during host defense.

TI  - The contribution of tandem repeat number to the O-glycosylation of mucins.
PG  - 265-77
AB  - The serine- and threonine-rich tandem repeat (TR) units that make up the 
      characteristic feature of mucin glycoproteins are often polymorphic with 
      substantial genetic variation in TR number. The precise effect of TR number on 
      O-glycosylation is not fully understood, although the TR number of several mucins 
      may be associated with apparent susceptibility to certain human diseases. To 
      evaluate the contribution of TR number to O-glycosylation, we generated a series 
      of chimeric mucins carrying increasing numbers of TR units from the MUC5B mucin 
      in the context of an epitope-tagged MUC1 mucin backbone. These mucins were 
      expressed in Caco2 colon carcinoma cell clones and purified by 
      immunoprecipitation. O-Glycosylation was investigated by western blotting with 
      antibodies to known carbohydrate structures and by fast atom bombardment-mass 
      spectrometry. Additional carbohydrate epitopes were detected with antibodies on 
      chimeric mucins with a higher TR number in comparison to those with fewer TRs. 
      Using mass spectrometry, higher-molecular-weight glycans were detected more 
      frequently on the mucins with extended TRs compared to those with fewer TRs. 
      However no novel carbohydrate structures were seen, suggesting that TR number 
      does not affect the specificity of O-glycosylation.

TI  - Non-glycosylated tandem repeats of MUC1 facilitate attachment of breast tumor 
      cells to normal human lung tissue and immobilized extracellular matrix proteins 
      (ECM) in vitro: potential role in metastasis.
PG  - 339-45
AB  - MUC1 is a transmembrane glycoprotein abundantly expressed on the apical surface 
      of human ductal epithelial cells and over entire cell surface of tumors 
      originating from those cells. It is 300 to 500 nm long and has a rigid, rod-like 
      structure protruding from the cell surface. MUC1 expressed by normal cells has 
      heavily O-glycosylated tandem repeat domain while MUC1 on malignant cells is 
      aberrantly O-glycosylated. Substantially reduced (aberrant) glycosylation of the 
      tandem repeat region of tumor MUC1 results in uncovering of the polypeptide core. 
      This new structural feature may play an important role in the attachment of 
      metastasizing tumor cells to tissues at distant sites. We show that MDA-MB-231 
      cells attaching to the immobilized extracellular matrix proteins (ECM) are higher 
      MUC1 expressers than those non-attaching and that the attachment is inhibited by 
      the addition of non-glycosylated, MUC1 peptide. This 100 a.a. peptide composed of 
      5 tandem repeats from the tandem repeat domain mimics the forms of MUC1 found in 
      ascites fluid of cancer patients. We also show that this synthetic form of MUC1 
      inhibited attachment of breast tumor cells to sections of normal human lung 
      tissue and immobilized ECM. We did not find correlation between the expression of 
      Tn (GalNAc-Ser/Thr) epitope and the ability of tumor cells to adhere to the 
      immobilized ECM. These results indicate that the non-glycosylated form of MUC1 
      plays a role in the initial attachment of carcinoma cells to tissues at distant 
      sites, which may facilitate establishment of metastatic foci.

TI  - Decreased levels of the goblet cell mucin MUC5AC in tears of patients with 
      Sjogren syndrome.
PG  - 1004-11
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether the relative amounts of mucin mRNA in the 
      conjunctival epithelium and mucin protein in the tears are altered in patients 
      with Sjogren syndrome compared with healthy individuals. METHODS: Tear fluid was 
      collected from the inferior fornix of normal subjects (n = 17) and patients with 
      Sjogren syndrome (n = 11) after instillation of 60 microL sterile water onto the 
      ocular surface. Immediately after tear fluid collection, conjunctival epithelium 
      was obtained by filter paper-stripping from the bulbar temporal region for mRNA 
      isolation. Primers to nontandem repeat sequences of the gel-forming mucin MUC5AC 
      and the membrane-spanning mucins MUC1 and MUC4 were used in real-time RT-PCR to 
      determine relative abundance of MUC mRNA in patients with Sjogren syndrome in 
      relation to that of normal subjects. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was 
      performed on neuraminidase-treated tears, using a polyclonal antibody against a 
      synthetic peptide mimicking the deduced amino acid sequence from the D3 region of 
      MUC5AC. RESULTS: The number of RNA transcripts for the goblet cell-specific mucin 
      MUC5AC in the conjunctival epithelium of patients with Sjogren syndrome was 
      significantly lower than in normal individuals. No significant changes were 
      detected when analyzing the mRNA levels of the mucins expressed by the stratified 
      epithelium of the conjunctiva, MUC1 and MUC4. Protein levels of the goblet cell 
      mucin MUC5AC were significantly reduced in the tear fluid of patients with 
      Sjogren syndrome, corroborating mRNA data obtained using real-time RT-PCR. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The tear fluid of patients with Sjogren syndrome has reduced levels 
      of the goblet cell-specific mucin MUC5AC, which correlates to decreased levels of 
      conjunctival MUC5AC mRNA. The authors propose that deficiency of MUC5AC mucin in 
      tears constitutes one of the mechanisms responsible for tear film instability in 
      Sjogren syndrome.

TI  - In vivo glycosylation of mucin tandem repeats.
PG  - 459-71
AB  - The biochemical and biophysical properties of mucins are largely determined by 
      extensive O-glycosylation of serine- and threonine-rich tandem repeat (TR) 
      domains. In a number of human diseases aberrant O-glycosylation is associated 
      with variations in the properties of the cell surface-associated and secreted 
      mucins. To evaluate in vivo the O-glycosylation of mucin TR domains, we generated 
      recombinant chimeric mucins with TR sequences from MUC2, MUC4, MUC5AC, or MUC5B, 
      which were substituted for the native TRs of epitope-tagged MUC1 protein (MUC1F). 
      These hybrid mucins were extensively O-glycosylated and showed the expected 
      association with the cell surface and release into culture media. The presence of 
      different TR domains within the chimeric mucins appears to have limited influence 
      on their posttranslational processing. Alterations in glycosylation were detailed 
      by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and reactivity with antibodies against 
      particular blood-group and tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens. Future 
      applications of these chimeras will include investigations of mucin 
      posttranslational modification in the context of disease.

TI  - Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity can be induced by MUC1 peptide 
      vaccination of breast cancer patients.
PG  - 97-106
AB  - Human polymorphic epithelial mucin (PEM, MUC1) is a high molecular weight 
      transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on the apical cell surface of glandular 
      epithelium and is over-expressed and hypo-glycosylated in adenocarcinomas. The 
      extracellular part of the molecule consists mainly of a variable number of 20 
      amino acid repeats that contain cryptic epitopes exposed in malignancy. The 
      objective of our study was to determine whether humanized MUC1 MAbs and Abs 
      induced by vaccination of breast cancer patients with MUC1 peptides can effect an 
      antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). An in vitro assay has been 
      set up in which the breast tumor cell line ZR-75-1 is used as target and PBMC of 
      healthy donors as effector cells. Different target and effector cells, as well as 
      various MUC1 MAbs were tested to optimize the efficacy of the in vitro assay. The 
      humanized MAb HuHMFG-1, which recognizes the PDTR sequence in the MUC1 tandem 
      repeat, induced a strong cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Nine MUC1-expressing tumor 
      cell lines, including 3 bone marrow-derived cell lines, as well as 2 
      MUC1-transfected cell lines were susceptible to different extent to MUC1 
      Ab-dependent killing. Large variations in the killing capacity of PBMC from 
      healthy donors were found. The NK cells were the essential effector cells for the 
      MUC1 Ab-dependent killing. Plasma samples with induced high levels of MUC1 Ab 
      were obtained from breast cancer patients repeatedly immunized with a 
      KLH-conjugated 33-mer or 106-mer MUC1 tandem repeat. Pre- and post-vaccinated 
      plasma samples of these patients were compared in the ADCC assay and it could be 
      clearly demonstrated that the induced MUC1 Abs can effect tumor cell killing. 
      MUC1 Ab-dependent cell-mediated tumor cell killing may occur in vivo and the ADCC 
      assay can be applied to monitor MUC1 vaccination trials.

TI  - Phagocytosis of breast cancer cells mediated by anti-MUC-1 monoclonal antibody, 
      DF3, and its bispecific antibody.
PG  - 4061-5
AB  - Human epithelial mucin, MUC-1, is commonly expressed in adenocarcinoma including 
      80% of breast cancers. erbB-2 is overexpressed in approximately 30% of breast 
      cancers. Expression of MUC-1 and erbB-2 may be partially overlapping but 
      discoordinate. Therefore, combined use of antibodies directed against these two 
      antigens might increase the number of patients who benefit from immunotherapy. 
      Monoclonal antibody (MAb) DF3 recognizes the MUC-1 tandem repeat. We investigated 
      phagocytosis and cytolysis of cultured human breast cancer cells by 
      monocyte-derived macrophages mediated by MAb DF3 and its bispecific antibody 
      (BsAb) DF3xH22 with the second epitope directed against the Fc component of 
      phagocytic cells. Purified monocytes from healthy donors were cultured with 
      granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor with or without IFN-gamma. 
      antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) and antibody-dependent cellular 
      cytotoxicity (ADCC) assays were performed with these macrophages and 
      MUC-1-expressing target cells (ZR75-1) in the presence of MAb DF3 and BsAb 
      DF3xH22. ADCP was measured by two-color fluorescence flow cytometry using PKH2 
      (green fluorescent dye) and R-phytoerythrin (RPE) (red)-conjugated MAb against 
      human CD14 and CD11b and was confirmed by confocal microscopy. ADCC was measured 
      by (51)Cr release assay. Immunohistochemical staining studies of MUC-1 and erbB-2 
      were performed on 67 primary breast cancer tissues. Expression of MUC-1 and 
      erbB-2 was partially overlapping but discoordinate in 67 consecutive breast 
      cancers. Both MAb DF3 and BsAb DF3xH22 mediated ADCP. However, ADCP mediated by 
      MAb DF3 was greater than that mediated by BsAb DF3xH22. ADCC as detected by 
      (51)Cr release was not seen with either antibody. The addition of IFN-gamma to 
      monocyte-derived macrophage cultures inhibited ADCP compared to granulocyte 
      macrophage colony-stimulating factor alone. Given the partially overlapping but 
      discoordinate expression of MUC-1 and erbB-2 in breast cancer, therapy directed 
      toward both antigens should be considered. MAb DF3 and the BsAb DF3xH22, can 
      effectively mediate phagocytosis of MUC-1-expressing target cells. Further 
      investigations are needed to determine whether this antibody-induced phagocytosis 
      results in long-term specific T-cell activation against MUC-1.

TI  - CA19-9 epitope a possible marker for MUC-1/Y protein.
PG  - 1085-91
AB  - It has been reported that MUC-1 molecules devoid of the tandem repeat region 
      (MUC-1/Y) are detected preferentially in carcinoma cells and are associated with 
      their progression. However, its clinical significance is still unknown. We 
      constructed a mouse colon adenocarcinoma cell line (MC-38) transduced with either 
      MUC-1/Y cDNA defecting the tandem repeat region (Y-MC-38) or MUC-1/R cDNA 
      containing ten tandem repeats (R-MC-38). RT-PCR of mRNAs derived from Y-MC-38 
      cells using the specific primers to MUC-1/Y mRNAs, proved the existence of 600 bp 
      RT-PCR products generated only from MUC-1/Y mRNAs. DF3 and CA19-9 epitopes out of 
      the MUC-1-related tumor-associated antigens, have been reported to be involved in 
      the prognosis of cancer patients. We examined the expression of DF3 and CA19-9 
      epitopes on Y-MC-38 and R-MC-38 cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) 
      analysis of R-MC-38 and Y-MC-38 cells using two monoclonal antibodies against DF3 
      (mAb DF3) and CA19-9 (mAb CA19-9) epitopes revealed that R-MC-38 cells expressed 
      DF3 but not CA19-9 [DF3(+)CA19-9(-)], while Y-MC-38 cells expressed CA19-9 but 
      not DF3 [DF3(-)CA19-9(+)]. On Western blot, a 40 kDa protein product was 
      recognized by mAb CA19-9 but not by mAb DF3 on cell lysates of Y-MC-38 cells, 
      whereas a 70 kDa protein product was recognized by mAb DF3 but not by mAb CA19-9 
      on the cell lysates of R-MC-38. Further, we analyzed the expression of MUC-1/Y 
      mRNAs by RT-PCR on various human cancer cell lines: the gastric cancer cell line 
      AZ521, the pancreatic cancer cell lines PANC-1 and Capan-1, the gall bladder cell 
      line GBK-1, the breast cancer cell line MCF-7, and the colon cancer cell lines 
      HT-29 and Colo205. HT-29 and Capan-1 cells producing the 600 bp RT-PCR product, 
      were positive for mAb CA19-9. These results demonstrate that CA19-9 epitope is 
      produced only on MUC-1/Y core protein, suggesting that CA19-9 epitope may be a 
      specific marker for MUC-1/Y protein.

TI  - Identification of three non-VNTR MUC1-derived HLA-A*0201-restricted T-cell 
      epitopes that induce protective anti-tumor immunity in HLA-A2/K(b)-transgenic 
      mice.
PG  - 385-92
AB  - The human epithelial mucin MUC1 is over-expressed in more than 90% of carcinomas 
      of the breast, ovary, and pancreas as well as in some other tumours, making it a 
      potential target for tumour immunotherapy. We have identified several 
      MUC1-derived peptides mapping outside the variable number tandem repeat region 
      that comply with the peptide-binding motif for HLA-A*0201 and that become 
      processed into stable major histocompatibility complex-peptide complexes as 
      assessed by in vitro assays. In A2/K(b) transgenic mice, 3 peptides, namely 
      MUC(79-87) (TLAPATEPA), MUC(167-175) (ALGSTAPPV) and MUC(264-272) (FLSFHISNL) 
      elicit peptide-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) immunity, which protects 
      these mice against a challenge with MUC1, A2/K(b)-expressing tumour cells. These 
      peptides therefore represent naturally processed MUC1-derived CTL epitopes that 
      could be used as components in peptide-based vaccines and for the analysis of 
      anti-MUC1 CTL responses in A*0201-positive patients with MUC1-expressing tumours.

TI  - Reactivity of natural and induced human antibodies to MUC1 mucin with MUC1 
      peptides and n-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) peptides.
PG  - 702-12
AB  - Antibodies (Abs) to MUC1 occur naturally in both healthy subjects and cancer 
      patients and can be induced by MUC1 peptide vaccination. We compared the 
      specificity of natural and induced MUC1 Abs with the objective of defining an 
      effective MUC1 vaccine for active immunotherapy of adenocarcinoma patients. Serum 
      samples, selected out of a screened population of 492 subjects for their high 
      levels of IgG and/or IgM MUC1 Abs, were obtained from 55 control subjects and 
      from 26 breast cancer patients before primary treatment, as well as from 19 
      breast cancer patients immunized with MUC1 peptides coupled to keyhole limpet 
      hemocyanin (KLH) and mixed with QS-21. The samples were tested with enzyme-linked 
      immunoassays for reactivity with (1) overlapping hepta- and 20-mer peptides 
      spanning the MUC1 tandem repeat sequence; (2) two modified 60-mer peptides with 
      substitutions in the PDTR (PDTA) or in the STAPPA (STAAAA) sequence of each 
      tandem repeat; and (3) four 60-mer glycopeptides with each 1, 2, 3 and 5 mol 
      N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) per repeat. More than one minimal epitopic 
      sequence could be defined, indicating that Abs directed to more than one region 
      of the MUC1 peptide core can coexist in one and the same subject. The most 
      frequent minimal epitopic sequence of natural MUC1 IgG and IgM Abs was RPAPGS, 
      followed by PPAHGVT and PDTRP. MUC1 peptide vaccination induced high titers of 
      IgM and IgG Abs predominantly directed, respectively, to the PDTRPAP and the 
      STAPPAHGV sequences of the tandem repeat. Natural MUC1 Abs from breast cancer 
      patients reacted more strongly with the N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) peptides 
      than with the naked 60-mer peptide, while reactivity with the GalNAc-peptides was 
      significantly reduced (2-tailed p < 0.0001) in the MUC1 IgG and IgM Abs induced 
      by MUC1 peptide vaccination. Whereas in cancer patients glycans appear to 
      participate in epitope conformation, the epitope(s) recognized by MUC1 Abs 
      induced by peptide vaccination are already masked by minimal glycosylation. 
      Therefore, our results indicate that a MUC1 glycopeptide would be a better 
      vaccine than a naked peptide.

TI  - Flow cytometric measurement of intracellular cytokines detects immune responses 
      in MUC1 immunotherapy.
PG  - 829-37
AB  - The detection of tumor-specific T cells in immunized cancer patients usually 
      relies on lengthy and difficult CTL assays; we now report on flow cytometry to 
      detect the intracellular cytokines interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-4, IFN-gamma, and 
      tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) produced by CD4+CD69+ and CD8+CD69+ 
      activated T cells after MUC1 antigen stimulation. Peripheral blood mononuclear 
      cells were obtained from 12 patients with adenocarcinoma injected with 
      mannan-MUC1; cells were exposed in vitro for 18 h to MUCI peptide in the presence 
      of CD28 monoclonal antibody and Brefeldin; permeabilized cells were used for the 
      expression of cytokines. After stimulation in vitro with MUC1-variable number of 
      tandem repeats peptides, CD8+CD69+ T cells from all immunized patients generated 
      3-9 times higher levels of TNF-alpha(P < 0.038) and IFN-gamma (P <0.010) than did 
      cells from 12 normal subjects; minor increases in IL-4 occurred. By contrast, 
      CD4+CD69+ cells showed no overall alteration in TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma cytokine 
      production, although in some patients, their measurement was informative; the 
      measurement of IL-2 was not useful in either CD4+CD69+ or CD8+CD69+ cells. We 
      conclude that in MUC1-immunized patients, the measurement of TNF-alpha and 
      IFN-gamma in activated CD69+CD8+ T cells may be indicative of their immune 
      status.

TI  - Survival in early breast cancer patients is favorably influenced by a natural 
      humoral immune response to polymorphic epithelial mucin.
PG  - 574-83
AB  - PURPOSE: Polymorphic epithelial mucin (PEM or MUC1) is being studied as a vaccine 
      substrate for the immunotherapy of patients with adenocarcinoma. The present 
      study analyzes the incidence of naturally occurring MUC1 antibodies in early 
      breast cancer patients and relates the presence of these antibodies in 
      pretreatment serum to outcome of disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured 
      immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to MUC1 with an 
      enzyme-linked immunoassay (PEM.CIg), which uses a MUC1 triple-tandem repeat 
      peptide conjugated to bovine serum albumin, in pretreatment serum samples 
      obtained from 154 breast cancer patients (52 with stage I disease and 102 with 
      stage II) and 302 controls. The median disease-specific survival time of breast 
      cancer patients was 74 months (range, 15 to 118 months). A positive test result 
      was defined as MUC1 IgG or IgM antibody levels equal to or greater than the 
      corresponding rounded-up median results obtained in the total breast cancer 
      population. RESULTS: A positive test result for both MUC1 IgG and IgM antibodies 
      in pretreatment serum was associated with a significant benefit in 
      disease-specific survival in stage I and II (P =.0116) breast cancer patients. 
      Positive IgG and IgM MUC1 antibody levels had significant additional prognostic 
      value to stage (P =.0437) in multivariate analysis. Disease-free survival 
      probability did not differ significantly. However, stage II patients who tested 
      positive for MUC1 IgG and IgM antibody and who relapsed had predominantly local 
      recurrences or contralateral disease, as opposed to recurrences at distant sites 
      in the patients with a negative humoral response (P =.026). CONCLUSION: Early 
      breast cancer patients with a natural humoral response to MUC1 have a higher 
      probability of freedom from distant failure and a better disease-specific 
      survival. MUC1 antibodies may control hematogenic tumor dissemination and 
      outgrowth by aiding the destruction of circulating or seeded MUC1-expressing 
      tumor cells. Vaccination of breast cancer patients with MUC1-derived 
      (glyco)peptides in an adjuvant setting may favorably influence the outcome of 
      disease.

TI  - Novel breast-tumor-associated MUC1-derived peptides: characterization in Db-/- x 
      beta2 microglobulin (beta2m) null mice transgenic for a chimeric 
      HLA-A2.1/Db-beta2 microglobulin single chain.
PG  - 391-7
AB  - The MUC1 protein was found to be up-regulated in a spectrum of malignant tumors. 
      T-cell responses to the MUC1 extracellular tandem repeat array (TRA) were 
      observed in murine models as well as in breast-carcinoma patients. In the present 
      study, we evaluated the anti-tumor potential of HLA-A2.1-motif-selected peptides 
      from non-TRA domains of the molecule. Peptide immunogenicity was examined in the 
      Db-/- x beta2 microglobulin (beta2m) null mice transgenic for a modified 
      HLA-A2.1/Db-beta2 microglobulin single chain (HHD mice). Our results show the 
      existence of 3 novel HLA-A2.1-restricted MUC1-derived cytotoxic T-lymphocyte 
      (CTL) epitopes. These peptides are processed and presented by the HHD-transfected 
      breast-tumor cell line MDA-MB-157. Moreover, CTL induced by these 3 peptides show 
      higher lysis of target cells pulsed with breast-carcinoma-derived peptides than 
      of targets pulsed with normal breast-tissue-derived peptides. These data suggest 
      an important role for non-TRA MUC1-derived peptides as inducers of a 
      MHC-restricted CTL reaction to a breast-carcinoma cell line and patient-derived 
      tumor extracts.

TI  - Epithelial mucin-1 (MUC1) expression and MA5 anti-MUC1 monoclonal antibody 
      targeting in multiple myeloma.
PG  - 3065s-3072s
AB  - Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematological cancer in the 
      United States. It is typically incurable, even with myeloablative chemotherapy 
      and stem-cell transplantation. The epithelial mucin-1 (MUC1) glycoprotein is 
      expressed by normal and malignant epithelial cells but has also been shown to be 
      expressed by MM cells. MUC1 is a useful antigenic target in solid tumors for 
      clinical diagnostic and therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based approaches. 
      The MA5 mAb, as well as other anti-MUC1 mAbs reactive with the MUC1 variable 
      number tandem repeat domain, exhibited moderate to strong reactivity with both MM 
      cell lines and clinical samples. To explore the biochemical nature and potential 
      of MUC1 as an antigenic target in MM, studies were performed to: (a) compare the 
      mRNA and the MUC1 glycoprotein species between epithelial cancer and MM cell 
      lines; and (b) develop and use a human MM tumor xenograft model system to study 
      the biodistribution of the MA5 mAb. MA5 mAb was strongly reactive with six of 
      eight human MM cell lines by flow cytometry. In seven of eight MM patient samples 
      (bone marrow and/or peripheral blood) reactivity was found in 10-90% of the 
      cells, whereas normal control (n = 5) and leukemia and lymphoma (n = 5) cells 
      showed only 0-6% reactivity. 125I-labeled MA5 whole-cell binding studies showed 
      quantitatively similar amounts of binding between strongly positive MM lines and 
      high-MUC1-expressing breast carcinoma lines. mRNA expression was assessed by 
      Northern blotting and reverse transcription-PCR. MM cell lines were positive by 
      both methods, with strong similarity in the sizes of the mRNAs and cDNAs that 
      were obtained. Finally, biodistribution experiments were carried out with 
      131I-labeled MA5 versus a nonbinding control 125I-labeled mAb in a s.c. MM 
      xenograft model. Selective MM tumor uptake of the MA5 mAb was demonstrated, with 
      a potential for delivering a tumor radiation absorbed dose of 8540 cGy/mCi of 
      injected dose compared with 3099 cGy/mCi of tumor-absorbed dose delivered by 
      nonspecific antibody.

TI  - Immunization of chimpanzees with tumor antigen MUC1 mucin tandem repeat peptide 
      elicits both helper and cytotoxic T-cell responses.
PG  - 1918-24
AB  - CTLs and antibody responses to the tumor-associated antigen MUC1 mucin can be 
      detected in patients with adenocarcinomas of the breast, pancreas, colon, and 
      ovary. However, neither response is generally effective at controlling disease. 
      Methods to augment immunity to MUC1 are being designed, with the expectation that 
      this will lead to an antitumor response. The key to eliciting potent immunity to 
      tumor MUC1 may be in generating MUC1-specific T-helper cell responses, which, to 
      date, have not been reported in cancer patients. We have recently demonstrated 
      that a synthetic vaccine representing five copies of the MUC1 tandem repeat 
      peptide can be used to prime MUC1-specific human CD4+ T cells in vitro. Here, we 
      extend these studies to test the immunogenicity and safety of the tandem repeat 
      peptide in the chimpanzee, which has the identical MUC1 tandem repeat sequence to 
      the human. To promote induction of Th1-type responses, we used the novel adjuvant 
      LeIF, a Leishmania-derived protein that is known to stimulate human peripheral 
      blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and antigen-presenting cells, to produce a 
      Th1-type cytokine profile. We found that MUC1 tandem repeat peptide administered 
      with LeIF elicited positive, albeit transient, proliferative T-cell responses to 
      MUC1 in the PBMCs from four of four chimpanzees. Immunization induced 
      MUC1-specific IFN-gamma but not interleukin 4 expression in CD4+ T cells from 
      PBMCs and draining lymph nodes. MUC1-specific CTLs were also generated that did 
      not induce detectable autoimmune dysfunction during the 1 year of observation. We 
      conclude that the MUC1 tandem repeat peptide can be used to elicit both T-helper 
      and cytotoxic cell responses to MUC1 in the primate and holds promise as a safe 
      and effective cancer vaccine.

TI  - MUC1 isoform specific monoclonal antibody 6E6/2 detects preferential expression 
      of the novel MUC1/Y protein in breast and ovarian cancer.
PG  - 256-67
AB  - The products of the MUC1 gene are known to be highly expressed in human breast 
      cancer cells. The best characterized MUC1 protein is a polymorphic, type 1 
      transmembrane molecule containing a large extracellular domain composed primarily 
      of a variable number of 20 amino acid tandem repeats. We have recently identified 
      a novel protein product of the MUC1 gene, the MUC1/Y protein, that is also a 
      transmembrane protein but is devoid of the tandem repeat array and its immediate 
      flanking sequences. To analyze its expression in tumor cells we generated 
      monoclonal antibodies directed against the MUC1/Y extracellular domain 
      (anti-MUC1/Yex MAbs). Epitope mapping identified the MAb, 6E6, which recognized 
      the MUC1/Y isoform with exquisite specificity- the repeat-array-containing MUC1 
      isoform could not compete out this immunoreactivity. A 30mer peptide which is 
      unique for MUC1/Y and corresponds to the "join" region generated by the MUC1/Y 
      specific splice, abrogated all 6E6 MAb immunoreactivity towards MUC1/Y. 
      Immunoprecipitation of the MUC1/Y protein with 6E6 MAbs revealed that, in 
      contrast with the proteolytic cleavage of the tandem-repeat-array-containing MUC1 
      isoform, MUC1/Y is not cleaved. Flow cytometry analyses using the 6E6 MAbs 
      demonstrated that the MUC1/Y isoform is expressed on the cell surface of both 
      MCF-7 breast cancer cells and malignant epithelial cells present in effusions 
      obtained from breast and ovarian cancer patients. Our results unequivocally 
      establish that the MUC1/Y protein is expressed on the surface of breast cancer 
      cells and cells of other epithelial malignancies. The anti-MUC1/Y MAbs described 
      here can target MUC1/Y expressing tumor cells in vivo and are likely to be 
      important reagents both for epithelial tumor diagnosis and immunotherapy.

TI  - Presentation of MUC1 tumor antigen by class I MHC and CTL function correlate with 
      the glycosylation state of the protein taken Up by dendritic cells.
PG  - 143-9
AB  - We previously reported that the glycosylated MUC1 tumor antigen circulating as 
      soluble protein in patients' serum is not processed by dendritic cells and does 
      not elicit MHC-Class II-restricted T helper responses in vitro. In contrast, a 
      long synthetic peptide from the MUC1 tandem repeat region is presented by Class 
      II molecules, resulting in the initiation of T helper cell responses. Here we 
      addressed the ability of dendritic cells to present various glycosylated or not 
      glycosylated forms of MUC1 by MHC Class I. We found that three different forms of 
      MUC1, ranging from glycosylated and underglycosylated protein to unglycosylated 
      synthetic peptide, were able to elicit MUC1-specific, Class-I-restricted CTL 
      responses. The efficiency of processing and the resulting strength of CTL 
      activity were inversely correlated with the degree of glycosylation of the 
      antigen. Furthermore, the more efficiently processed 100mer peptide primed a 
      broader repertoire of CTL than the glycosylated protein.

TI  - Cellular and humoral immune responses to MUC1 mucin and tandem-repeat peptides in 
      ovarian cancer patients and controls.
PG  - 47-55
AB  - The objective of this study was to demonstrate the presence of proliferative T 
      cell responses to human polymorphic epithelial mucin (MUC1) and its tandem-repeat 
      peptides in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from ovarian cancer 
      patients and from controls and to correlate these cellular responses to a humoral 
      response to MUC1. PBMC were obtained from 6 healthy women, from 13 women in the 
      third trimester of pregnancy and from 21 ovarian cancer patients. Only 1 of the 6 
      healthy women showed a weak primary proliferative response (stimulation index, SI 
      <2) to a 20-mer MUC1 tandem-repeat peptide in the presence of interleukin-2 
      (IL-2). In PBMC from 5/13 pregnant women (38%) a weak response could be induced 
      by the 20-mer and/or 60-mer tandem-repeat peptides (SI < or =3.0) and in PBMC 
      from 8/15 ovarian cancer patients (53%) 20-mer and/or 60-mer MUC1 tandem-repeat 
      peptides induced primary responses (SI < or =5.4). MUC1 mucin purified from a 
      breast tumor cell line and/or from urine of a healthy donor had a relatively 
      strong stimulating effect (SI < or =19) on PBMC from 4 of 16 ovarian cancer 
      patients (25%). In contrast, in PBMC of 9 ovarian cancer patients stimulated by 
      the addition of a Candida albicans extract, MUC1 mucin strongly inhibited 
      proliferation. This inhibition could partially be abrogated by the addition of 
      IL-2. MUC1 (CA 15.3 assay) and free circulating MUC1 IgG and IgM antibodies 
      (PEM.CIg assay) were determined in the plasma of all subjects. The MUC1 and the 
      free circulating MUC1 IgG antibody plasma levels were significantly higher in the 
      ovarian cancer patients than in the healthy women. Although no significant 
      correlations were found between MUC1 mucin, MUC1 Ab plasma levels and the 
      individual proliferative responses to the MUC1 antigens, an association may exist 
      between them, since all three are significantly higher in the ovarian cancer 
      patients than in the healthy women.

TI  - Specificity analysis of sera from breast cancer patients vaccinated with MUC1-KLH 
      plus QS-21.
PG  - 1806-12
AB  - The mucin MUC1 is expressed on breast cancers in an underglycosylated form 
      compared to normal tissues and is therefore a potential target for cancer 
      immunotherapy. MUC1 contains multiple tandem repeats of the 20 amino acid (aa) 
      peptide (VTSAPDTRPAPGSTAPPAHG). The APDTRPA epitope is particularly immunogenic 
      since it is recognized by a variety of murine monoclonal antibodies and by some 
      sera and cytotoxic T-cells from unimmunized patients with epithelial cancers. We 
      have prepared a 30 aa peptide (C)VTSAPDTRPAPGSTAPPAHGVTSAPDTRPA with cysteine at 
      the N-terminal end, and used the cysteine for chemical conjugation to keyhole 
      limpet haemocyanin (KLH). Six breast cancer patients immunized with this 
      conjugate plus the immunological adjuvant QS-21 have all produced high titre (by 
      ELISA) IgG and IgM antibodies against the 30 aa MUC1 peptide, but these sera 
      reacted moderately, or not at all, with MUC1-positive tumour cells. To understand 
      this specificity better, we prepared a series of smaller peptides to determine 
      the epitopes recognized by these immune sera in inhibition assays. Only peptides 
      containing APDTRPA at the C-terminal end were able to completely inhibit ELISA 
      reactivity for the full 30 aa peptide. No sera were completely inhibited by 
      APDTR, APDTRP, PDTRPA or any other peptides that did not contain the full APDTRPA 
      epitope. Remarkably, sera from all six patients recognized this same epitope and 
      were completely inhibited by only this epitope. The specificity of these sera (1) 
      primarily for C-terminal APDTRPA, and the absence of this epitope at the 
      C-terminal end of any tumour mucins, and (2) the N-terminal APDTRPA alanine, 
      which is normally buried in the beta turn MUC1 assumes in its secondary structure 
      may explain the moderate to weak reactivity of these high titer sera against 
      MUC1-positive tumour cells.

TI  - Histochemical and genetic analysis of colonic mucin glycoproteins in 
      Hirschsprung's disease.
PG  - 330-3
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Mucin glycoproteins (mucins) recently have been shown to be 
      deficient in the colonic mucosa of patients with Hirschsprung's disease (HD). The 
      authors performed a detailed histo- and immunohistochemical analysis of mucins in 
      the colonic mucosa and studied the expression of mucin genes to characterize 
      histologically mucin quality and gene expression in HD compared with controls. 
      METHODS: Paraffin-embedded 4-microm thick sections from patients with HD (n = 11 
      ganglionic, 10 aganglionic) and controls (n = 19) were taken. Slides were stained 
      with mild periodic acid Schiff with and without saponification with KOH (reacts 
      with O-actylated mucins), high iron diamine/alcian blue (differentiates sulphated 
      v nonsulphated mucins), the monoclonal antimucin antibodies, PR3A5 (against di- 
      and tri-O-acetylated sialic acids) and 91.9H (against sulphated mucins). 
      O-acetylation and sulphation both confer an increased resistance of mucins to 
      bacterial degradation and are thought to be important in the defensive function 
      of the colonic mucus gel layer. In situ hybridization was used to study 
      expression of the mucin genes MUC 1, 2, 3, 4, 5AC, 5B, 6, 7, and 8. 
      [35S]-sulphate-labelled antisense oligonucleotide 48mer probes designed to the 
      known tandem repeat domains of MUC genes were used. After hybridization and 
      washing the slides were opposed to Hyperfilm MP for 7 days. The autoradiographs 
      were scored by three independent observers for differences in expression and by 
      image analysis. Those with positive findings were dipped in photographic 
      emulsion, developed, and counterstained for photomicrographs. RESULTS: There were 
      different patterns of staining dependent on the region of the colon and 
      especially the age of the patient with three reagents. No significant differences 
      in the histological staining pattern was detected between HD patients and 
      controls. The colonic mucins in HD were found to be primarily O-acetylated and 
      sulphated. The MUC gene expression was similar in patients and controls. MUC2 and 
      4 were strongly expressed, MUC1, 3, and 5B had moderate to weak expression, and 
      MUC 5AB, 6, 7, and 8 had baseline expression. CONCLUSIONS: The mucin 
      glycoproteins in children with HD, although quantitatively deficient, show no 
      qualitative differences on histo- and immunohistochemical staining from normal 
      controls. The expression of all the known mucin genes, the genetic control of 
      mucin secretion, and the quality of mucins, is similar to normal controls.

TI  - Prognostic values of MUC-1 molecule expressing cytokine receptor-like epitope and 
      DF3 in patients with gastric carcinoma.
PG  - 425-35
AB  - As recently reported, DF3/MUC-1 molecules having cytokine receptor-like sequences 
      (CRL) at the extracellular region, are likely to function in signal transduction 
      pathways. To elucidate the functional significance of CRL expressed on the 
      DF3/MUC1 molecule, immunohistochemical localization of CRL and/or DF3 was 
      investigated in cases of 115 patients with gastric carcinomas, treated by 
      surgical resection. CRL was detected in 65 of 115 patients (56.5%), DF3 in 85 
      (73.9%), and both DF3 and CRL in 52 (45.2%). The combined immunohistochemical 
      analysis of CRL and/or DF3, revealed that simultaneous expression of DF3 and CRL 
      (DF3+/CRL+) significantly correlated to lymph node metastasis and to blood vessel 
      invasion, and that patients with DF3+/CRL+-tumors survived for a significantly 
      shorter period after surgery than did the other three groups (DF3+/CRL-, 
      DF3-/CRL+, and DF3-/CRL-). Multivariate analysis showed independent prognostic 
      significance for DF3+/CRL+ expression (hazard ratio [HR]=2.733, P=0.0085), and 
      surgical cure (HR=4.334, P=0.003). To investigate the biological role of the 
      simultaneous expression of DF3 and CRL, we constructed DF3-/CRL+ (NR-MC-38) and 
      DF3+/CRL+ (R-MC-38) cells by transducing a mouse colon adenocarcinoma cell line 
      MC-38 expressing neither DF3 nor CRL with MUC-1 cDNA containing ten tandem 
      repeats (R-MC-38) or MUC-1 cDNA devoid of tandem repeats (NR-MC-38). R-MC-38 
      (DF3+/CRL+) cells were more invasive than NR-MC-38 (DF3-/CRL+) and MC-38 
      (DF3-/CRL-) cells. When these transfectants were incubated with pAb CRL, the 
      invasiveness of R-MC-38 (DF3+/CRL+) was strikingly elevated over the case with 
      native MC-38 (DF3-/CRL-) and NR-MC-38 (DF3-/CRL+) cells. The pAb CRL-induced 
      invasiveness of R-MC-38 cells was inhibited by adding mAb DF3 or CRL peptides 
      together with pAb CRL. These results suggest that an expression of DF3/MUC1 is 
      highly associated with cell-invasiveness, and the DF3/MUC1-associated 
      invasiveness is amplified by CRL. Thus DF3+/CRL+-MUC-1 molecule seems to be 
      closely involved in a poor prognosis for gastric cancer patients.

PG  - 272-7
AB  - The humoral immune response against a tumour-associated antigen, polymorphic 
      epithelial mucin (PEM, MUC1) in cancer patients was studied by isolating specific 
      B cells primed for the antigen. Human B lymphocytes from tumour-draining lymph 
      nodes, obtained from 12 patients with epithelial cancers, were immunoselected 
      with magnetic beads coated with a 60mer synthetic peptide corresponding to three 
      tandem repeats of the protein core of the MUC1 antigen. Short-term cultures of B 
      cells were established utilizing interleukin-10 (IL-10), IL-4 and monoclonal 
      antibody anti-CD40, and were maintained for a maximum of 3 weeks. B cell culture 
      supernatants contained human anti-MUC1 antibodies, as detected by enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay, in 6/12 of the patients tested. Five of these patients, all 
      with early-stage cancer, also had high levels of circulating anti-MUC1 IgM 
      antibodies in the serum. A significant correlation was found (two-tailed P = 
      0.041) between the presence of circulating anti-MUC1 antibodies and the ability 
      to isolate PEM-specific B cells from tumour-draining lymph nodes. The technique 
      proposed provides a useful method for the analysis of natural immunity against 
      defined tumour antigens.

TI  - Passively transferred anti-MUC1 antibodies cause neither autoimmune disorders nor 
      immunity against transplanted tumors in MUC1 transgenic mice.
PG  - 595-9
AB  - C57BL/6 mice transgenic for human MUC1 (MUC1.Tg) have been developed to 
      investigate the autoimmune consequences of producing MUC1 tumor immunity in an 
      animal that expresses MUC1 as a self-protein on normal ductal epithelia. Previous 
      work showed that MUC1.Tg mice challenged with MUC1-bearing syngeneic tumors 
      (B16.MUC1) developed progressively growing MUC1-expressing tumors and no 
      detectable MUC1-specific antibody (Ab) response. In contrast, wild-type C57BL/6 
      (wt) mice developed MUC1-negative tumors at a significantly slower rate and 
      produced approximately 50 microg IgG1 Ab reactive with the MUC1 tandem repeat 
      (TR)/ml of sera. One milliliter of these sera was administered passively to 
      MUC1.Tg or wt mice and the concentration of the MUC1 TR-reactive IgG1 Abs was 
      monitored over time. The results indicate that circulating MUC1-reactive Abs were 
      detectable in MUC1.Tg mice and that significant amounts of these Abs were not 
      absorbed by organs that endogenously express MUC1. No evidence of autoimmune 
      disease, either gross or histological, was observed in the MUC1.Tg recipients of 
      sera suggesting that MUC1, an organ-specific protein expressed primarily by 
      secretory epithelia, is inaccessible to circulating MUC1 -reactive Abs. 
      Additional studies showed that polyclonal sera containing IgG1 Abs reactive with 
      MUC1 TR were unable to provide protection against the growth of syngeneic tumors 
      expressing MUC1 in the MUC1.Tg animal model.

TI  - Naturally processed class II epitope from the tumor antigen MUC1 primes human 
      CD4+ T cells.
PG  - 5066-70
AB  - Epithelial cell mucin MUC1 is expressed on adenocarcinomas in an 
      underglycosylated form that serves as a tumor antigen in breast, pancreatic, 
      ovarian, and other tumors. Two predominant MUC1-specific immune responses are 
      found in patients: CD8+ CTLs, which recognize tandemly repeated epitopes on the 
      MUC1 protein core, and IgM antibodies. There have been no reports to date of 
      MUC1-specific CD4+ T-helper cells in cancer patients. We show here that 
      MUC1-specific CD4+ T cells are neither deleted nor tolerized and that CD4+ T cell 
      responses can be generated when an appropriate soluble form of MUC1 is used. 
      Naive CD4+ T cells from healthy donors were primed in vitro to a synthetic MUC1 
      peptide of 100 amino acids, representing five unglycosylated tandem repeats, 
      presented by dendritic cells. They produced IFN-gamma and had moderate cytolytic 
      activity. We identified one core peptide sequence, PGSTAPPAHGVT, that elicits 
      this response when it is presented by HLA-DR3.

TI  - Induction of HLA-unrestricted and HLA-class-II-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes 
      against MUC-1 from patients with colorectal carcinomas using recombinant MUC-1 
      vaccinia virus.
PG  - 21-31
AB  - We recently reported that immunization with a recombinant MUC-1 vaccinia virus 
      (rVMUC-1) protected C57BL/6 mice from challenge with DF3/MUC-1-positive syngeneic 
      tumors. To elucidate whether anti-MUC-1 tumor immunity, especially MUC-1-specific 
      cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTI), can be induced in cancer patients by rVMUC-1, we 
      stimulated the peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with DF3/MUC-1+ or 
      DF3/MUC-1 colon carcinomas using the autologous monocytes infected with rVMUC-1 
      (rVAMN). The stimulated T lymphocytes from two patients with DF3/MUC-1-positive 
      colorectal carcinomas (rVPY+T and rVPW+T) demonstrated HLA-unrestricted 
      cytotoxicity against MUC-1, whereas those from the patient with 
      DF3/MUC-1-negative colon carcinoma (rVPA-T) did not. The HLA-unrestricted 
      cytotoxicity was demonstrated by the CD8+ T cells possibly recognizing an epitope 
      present on the tandem repeats. Adoptive immunotherapy who performed three times 
      with patient PY, at 4-week intervals. The adoptive transfer of the first 
      stimulated lymphocytes, demonstrating a high level of HLA-unrestricted 
      cytotoxicity against MUC-1, resulted in the significant reduction of the liver 
      metastasis of patient PY. However, HLA-unrestricted cytotoxicity against MUC-1 
      was extremely reduced at the second transfer and finally eliminated at the third, 
      whereas the CD4+ T cells demonstrating HLA-class-II-restricted cytotoxicity 
      against MUC-1 predominantly proliferated at the third adoptive immunotherapy 
      treatment. The liver metastasis and the serum levels of tumor markers 
      (carcinoembryonic antigen CA19-9) demonstrated a rapid and marked increment after 
      the second transfer and especially after the third. These results suggest that 
      the HLA-unrestricted cytotoxic CD8+ T cells against MUC-1, induced in patients 
      with DF3/MUC-1+ colorectal carcinomas using rVMUC-1, correlate with the antitumor 
      activity in vivo.

TI  - Structure-based design of peptides that recognize the CD4 binding domain of HIV-1 
      gp120.
PG  - 1413-8
AB  - DESIGN: Envelope protein-specific antiviral peptides, called mucibodies, that can 
      specifically recognize and bind to the surface unit protein gp120 of HIV-1 were 
      designed. The initial mucibody binding target was the V3 loop of HIV-1 gp120. 
      Here, the gp120-CD4 binding domain was chosen as the site of mucibody binding. 
      The CD4 binding domain of gp120 is known to be a conformational epitope and is 
      involved in the earliest events of viral entry into many cells. METHODS: The 
      design of the mucibody antivirals was based on previous observations that 
      antibody complementarity determining regions (CDR) are generally similar to the 
      repeating loops or knob structures found in the 20-residue tandem repeat domain 
      of human mucin MUC1. The heavy chain CDR3 from the bacteriophage display antibody 
      b12 was used to construct two mucibodies, b12-CDR1 and b12-26. RESULTS: Peptides 
      corresponding to three tandem repeats were shown to bind directly to the CD4 
      binding domain of HIV-1 gp120 in a solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 
      These mucibody peptides also disrupted the gp120-CD4 interaction in a 
      solution-phase inhibition assay. Finally, mucibodies neutralized primary and 
      laboratory macrophage-tropic isolates of HIV-1. CONCLUSIONS: There is a potential 
      for medical use of these peptides as topical vaginal microbicides in preventing 
      HIV-1 transmission during sexual contact. These results also suggest that 
      multivalent, non-immunogenic binding proteins of virtually any specificity could 
      be constructed for use in therapeutic applications involving infectious diseases 
      and immune system dysfunction.

TI  - Antibodies reactive with the protein core of MUC1 mucin are present in ovarian 
      cancer patients and healthy women.
PG  - 245-52
AB  - Antibodies reactive with peptide epitopes on the core protein of MUC1 epithelial 
      mucin have been demonstrated in some patients with adenocarcinomas. Because these 
      epitopes can be exposed on MUC1 in the serum of healthy women, we measured 
      concentrations of MUC1-reactive antibodies in the serum of healthy pregnant and 
      non-pregnant women, and in patients with benign and malignant ovarian tumours. 
      Antibodies were measured in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay utilising a 
      synthetic peptide corresponding to a 105-amino-acid segment of the MUC1 tandem 
      repeat region (5.25 repeats). MUC1-reactive antibodies were always of an IgM 
      isotype and concentrations were highest in young healthy women and declined 
      progressively with age (P=0.0006) concomitantly with increasing serum MUC1 levels 
      (P=0.003). Regardless of age, antibody levels were lower in cancer patients than 
      in healthy women (P<0.0001), but MUC1 levels were much higher in cancer patients 
      (P<0.0001). Although high antibody levels were associated with greater survival 
      in ovarian cancer (P=0.015), multivariate regression analysis showed that this 
      was not a significant independent prognostic indicator after consideration of the 
      International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, histological 
      type, serum MUC1 levels and age. Serial measurement of MUC1 and MUC1 antibodies 
      during treatment in 18 patients with ovarian cancer and throughout pregnancy in 
      10 women showed a negative correlation between alterations in MUC1 and MUC1 
      antibodies. These results show that MUC1-peptide-reactive antibodies are present 
      in the serum of healthy women and women with cancer and that they probably form 
      immune complexes with MUC1, but provide no evidence for an augmentation of the 
      humoral immune response to MUC1 in ovarian cancer

TI  - An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the measurement of circulating 
      antibodies to polymorphic epithelial mucin (MUC1).
PG  - 186-95
AB  - INTRODUCTION: About one-third of breast and ovarian carcinoma patients have 
      circulating antibodies reactive with polymorphic epithelial mucin (MUC1), either 
      free or bound to immune complexes. While the presence of these immune complexes 
      has prognostic significance in breast cancer patients, the significance of free 
      MUC1 antibodies is less clear. The objective of this study was to develop a 
      reliable assay for the accurate determination of circulating free antibodies to 
      MUC1. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
      (ELISA) (PEM.CIg) employing a 60 mer peptide (a triple tandem repeat sequence of 
      the MUC1 peptide core) conjugated to bovine serum albumin and peroxidase-labeled 
      antihuman immunoglobulin G or M antibodies. The assay was standardized and its 
      analytical performance evaluated. A total of 492 serum samples were obtained from 
      40 healthy men, from 201 healthy women (including 55 women without a history of 
      pregnancy and 45 pregnant women), and (before primary treatment) from 62 benign 
      breast tumor patients and 190 breast cancer patients. MUC1 serum levels were 
      determined with commercial CA 15-3 tests. RESULTS: Circulating antibodies to MUC1 
      are present both in healthy subjects and in breast cancer patients. The within- 
      and between-assay coefficients of variation were, respectively, 2 and 12% for the 
      IgG determinations and 1.2 and 3% for the IgM determinations. Correlation 
      coefficients for serially diluted serum samples ranged from 0.9998 to 0.9920 for 
      IgG and from 0.9996 to 0.9818 for IgM determinations. The reactivity of serum 
      samples was partially blocked by the addition of various MUC1 peptides and by 
      MUC1 mucin. The inhibiting effect of modified 60 mer peptides suggests the 
      presence of antibodies directed to more than one epitope. CONCLUSIONS: The PEM. 
      CIg assay is a reliable ELISA for measuring free MUC1 antibodies in serum. We are 
      in the process of relating the results obtained in the breast cancer group to 
      disease outcome to evaluate its prognostic significance. In addition, the assay 
      may become a useful tool for vaccine therapy monitoring.

TI  - Heterogeneity in the protein cores of mucins isolated from human middle ear 
      effusions: evidence for expression of different mucin gene products.
PG  - 283-91
AB  - High molecular weight mucins were isolated and purified from human middle ear 
      effusions of children with Otitis Media with Effusion (OME) classified into three 
      groups, (1) thick and (2) thin from anatomically normal children and (3) 
      effusions from cleft palate patients. Amino acid analyses of the purified mucins 
      from the three pools were similar but not identical with characteristic contents 
      of serine threonine and proline (32%, 28%, and 38% for pools (1) (2) and (3) 
      respectively). Proteinase resistant glycopeptide fragments corresponding to the 
      tandem repeat domains of cloned mucin genes showed marked differences both 
      between the three mucin pools and with the composition of the tandem repeat 
      sequences of the cloned mucin genes expressed in the airways. Studies on the 
      antigenic identity of middle ear mucins found an epitope likely to be present on 
      MUC5AC, but only accounting for a maximum of 15% by weight and no reactivity was 
      found with antibodies to MUC2 or MUC1. A polyclonal antibody raised to thick 
      effusion mucins reacted strongly with human salivary mucin suggesting the 
      presence of MUC5B epitopes. These studies suggest that more than one mucin gene 
      product is secreted by the human middle ear mucosa and that there may be further 
      mucin genes expressed by the middle ear that have yet to be cloned.

TI  - A large number of tandem repeats in the polymorphic epithelial mucin gene is 
      associated with severe acne.
PG  - 150-2
AB  - Polymorphic epithelial mucin (PEM) or MUC1 is a glycoprotein secreted from 
      various epithelial gland tissues. In skin, PEM is detected in sweat glands and 
      sebaceous glands by the DF3 monoclonal antibody. The gene of PEM includes an 
      allele exhibiting length polymorphism due to a variable number of tandem repeats 
      (VNTR); this is expressed co-dominantly, which may influence the microenvironment 
      of the skin. The allelic size variation of the PEM gene was investigated in 
      Japanese acne patients, atopic dermatitis patients, and healthy controls. The 
      frequency of longer length alleles was significantly higher in severe acne 
      patients.

TI  - Cyclophosphamide enhances the CTL precursor frequency in mice immunized with 
      MUC1-mannan fusion protein (M-FP).
PG  - 109-13
AB  - We have previously described the induction of murine CD8+ major 
      histocompatibility complex class I restricted cytotoxic T cells to the 20 amino 
      acid repeat region of human Mucin 1 (MUC1) variable number of tandem repeats 
      region--a mucin greatly increased in expression in breast cancer and proposed as 
      a target for immunotherapy. Mannan-MUC1 immunization protocol induces a high 
      cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) frequency, and some protection of mice against a 
      tumor challenge. The CTL frequency can be substantially increased using 
      cyclophosphamide (Cy), from 1/84,900 without Cy to 1/8,100 with Cy. Furthermore, 
      in the presence of Cy, established tumors are rapidly eradicated, which does not 
      happen in its absence. Cy clearly gives a major increase in the frequency of CTL 
      precursors (CTLp) to MUC1 and could be of therapeutic value in patients.

TI  - Cancer-associated MUC1 mucin inhibits human T-cell proliferation, which is 
      reversible by IL-2.
PG  - 43-9
AB  - A number of adenocarcinomas abundantly express and secrete underglycosylated MUC1 
      mucin. Underglycosylation exposes tandem repeat peptide sequences on 
      cancer-associated MUC1 mucin that are normally cryptic. High levels of MUC1 mucin 
      are correlated with a poor prognosis and immunosuppression in adenocarcinoma 
      patients. In this report we show that cancer-associated MUC1 mucin, 
      affinity-purified from ascites fluids of cancer patients, and synthetic tandem 
      repeats of MUC1 mucin core peptide can suppress human T-cell proliferative 
      responses. This MUC1 mucin-induced suppression of T-cell responses can be 
      reversed by the addition of exogenous IL-2 or anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody. 
      These results are consistent with other studies showing that lymphocytes present 
      in the vicinity of tumor cells are anergic and can be reactivated with exogenous 
      interleukin-2. Overcoming MUC1 mucin-induced immunosuppression with IL-2 combined 
      with active specific immunotherapy might be an effective immunotherapeutic 
      strategy against human adenocarcinomas.

TI  - MUC6 gene polymorphism in healthy individuals and in gastric cancer patients from 
      northern Portugal.
PG  - 1071-4
AB  - Mucins exhibit a high degree of genetic polymorphism because of the presence of a 
      variable number of tandem repeats. The aims of this work were to describe the 
      MUC6 gene polymorphism in the Portuguese population and to evaluate whether MUC6 
      gene polymorphism was involved in individual susceptibility to gastric cancer 
      development, as observed previously for the MUC1 gene. We found that the 10 
      alleles identified in the population of blood donors (n = 376), by Southern blot 
      analysis, were also found in gastric cancer patients (n = 157). However, 
      significant differences in allelic frequencies between the two populations were 
      observed for 4 of the 10 alleles, in agreement with those described previously 
      for the MUC1 gene; the largest allele was more frequent in blood donors, and 
      smaller alleles were more frequent in gastric cancer patients. Our results 
      suggest that MUC6 gene polymorphism is involved in the predisposition to gastric 
      carcinoma development.

TI  - Regulation of MUC5 and MUC1 gene expression: correlation with airway mucous 
      differentiation.
PG  - L846-53
AB  - The purpose of this paper was to obtain probes to study the structure and 
      function of mucins in rat models of airway cell differentiation and disease. We 
      report the isolation and characterization of the rat cDNA homologue of the human 
      airway secretory mucin, MUC5. Furthermore, we demonstrate the coordinate 
      regulation of the expression of MUC5 and MUC1 (a membrane-bound mucin) and mucous 
      differentiation. The rat MUC5 was cloned by the RT-PCR using motifs conserved in 
      the secretory mucins, MUC2 and MUC5. The rat cDNA revealed a high degree of 
      sequence similarity to human MUC5 (73% at the amino acid level). Alignments with 
      three other secretory mucins (human MUC5, human MUC2, rat MUC2), indicated a 
      conservation of the cysteines and of the octapeptide motifs, but a lack of 
      conservation of a short tandem repeat sequence that is found only in the human 
      MUC5. Northern analysis of MUC1 and MUC5 indicated a specific tissue-restricted 
      pattern of expression. Surprisingly, rat MUC5 exhibited a monodisperse signal, a 
      characteristic that is unusual for most secretory mucins, including the human 
      MUC5. Expression of MUC1 and MUC5 correlated with mucous differentiation. Both 
      genes were expressed at undetectable or very low levels in undifferentiated 
      cultures, but both mucins became strongly expressed during mucous 
      differentiation. Furthermore, neither mucin gene was expressed in 
      retinoid-deficient cultures that undergo squamous instead of mucous 
      differentiation. These studies demonstrate that expression of MUC1 and MUC5 is 
      coordinately regulated with airway mucous cell differentiation. These cDNAs 
      should provide useful tools to study mucin synthesis during differentiation and 
      disease.

TI  - Induction of cellular immunity in chimpanzees to human tumor-associated antigen 
      mucin by vaccination with MUC-1 cDNA-transfected Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized 
      autologous B cells.
PG  - 1699-704
AB  - Aberrant glycosylation of the mucin molecule (encoded by the gene MUC-1) on human 
      epithelial cell tumors leads to the exposure of tumor-associated epitopes 
      recognized by patients' antibodies and cytotoxic T cells. Consequently, these 
      epitopes could be considered targets for immunotherapy. We designed a cellular 
      vaccine, employing, instead of tumor cells, autologous Epstein-Barr virus 
      (EBV)-immortalized B cells as carriers of tumor-associated mucin, to take 
      advantage of their costimulatory molecules for T-cell activation. The vaccine was 
      tested in chimpanzees because of the identity of the human and chimpanzee MUC-1 
      tandem repeat sequence. EBV-immortalized B cells derived from two chimpanzees 
      were transfected with MUC-1 cDNA, treated with glycosylation inhibitor 
      phenyl-N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosaminide to expose tumor-associated epitopes, 
      irradiated, and injected subcutaneously four times at 3-week intervals. One 
      vaccine preparation also contained cells transduced with the interleukin 2 (IL-2) 
      cDNA and producing low levels of IL-2. Already after the first injection we found 
      in the peripheral blood measurable frequency of cytotoxic T-cell precursors 
      specific for underglycosylated mucin. The highest frequency observed was after 
      the last boost, in the lymph node draining the vaccination site. Delayed-type 
      hypersensitivity reaction to the injected immunogens was also induced, whereas no 
      appearance of mucin-specific antibodies was seen. Long-term observation of the 
      animals yielded no signs of adverse effects of this immunization. Autologous 
      antigen-presenting cells, like EBV-immortalized B cells, expressing 
      tumor-associated antigens are potentially useful immunogens for induction of 
      cellular anti-tumor responses in vivo.

TI  - Identification of an HLA-A11-restricted epitope from the tandem repeat domain of 
      the epithelial tumor antigen mucin.
PG  - 4766-74
AB  - Epithelial cell mucin encoded by the MUC-1 gene is overexpressed and aberrantly 
      glycosylated on pancreatic, breast, and ovarian cancers as well as on multiple 
      myelomas. It is recognized by patients' Ab and by T cells derived from 
      tumor-draining lymph nodes. The T cell recognition is not MHC restricted and is 
      specific for an epitope previously localized to the immunodominant tandem repeat 
      region of the native mucin molecule. In search of possible MHC-restricted 
      epitopes in the same immunodominant region, we synthesized a panel of 
      overlapping, nine-amino acid long peptides spanning the MUC-1 tandem repeat and 
      first examined their binding to specific human MHC class I molecules using two 
      independent flow cytometry-based assay systems. This approach identified one 
      peptide, p9-17 (STAPPAHGV), that bound to HLA-A1, -A2.1, -A3, and -A11. 
      Measurements of the affinity of binding to each of these alleles, using a 
      quantitative molecular binding assay, indicated that only the relative binding 
      affinity to HLA-A11 was close to immunogenic values. We tested the immunogenicity 
      of p9-17 in vitro. We detected a secondary T cell response specific for p9-17 in 
      lymph nodes from an HLA-A11 breast cancer patient. Moreover, CTL specific for 
      p9-17 peptide could be generated from PBL in several healthy HLA-A11 donors by 
      primary in vitro stimulation.

AB  - Human mucins are T or S glycosylated tandem repeat proteins. In breast cancer, 
      mucins become under or unglycosylated. Two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance 
      experiments are performed on chemically synthesized mucin tandem repeat 
      polypeptides, (PDTRPAPGST-APPAHGVTSA)n the unglycosylated form for n=1,3 where 
      (APDTR) constitutes the antigenic sites for the antibodies isolated form the 
      tumors in the breast cancer patients. These studies demonstrate how the tandem 
      repeats assemble in space giving rise to the overall tertiary structure, and the 
      local structure and presentation of the antigenic site(APDTR) at the junction of 
      two neighboring repeats. The NMR data reveal repeating knob-like structures 
      connected by extended spacers. The knobs protrude away from the long-axis of 
      Muc-1 and the predominant antigenic site (APDTR) forms the accessible tip of the 
      knob. Multiple tandem repeats enhance the rigidity and presentation of the 
      knob-like structures.

TI  - MUC1 in secretory phase endometrium: expression in precisely dated biopsies and 
      flushings from normal and recurrent miscarriage patients.
PG  - 2655-62
AB  - MUC1 is a cell-surface and secretory product of endometrial epithelium. 
      Immunohistochemical studies carried out using two different antibodies to the 
      mucin-type tandem repeat region of MUC1 indicate a cell-surface location in 
      proliferative phase glands, with intracellular deposits accumulating in the early 
      secretory phase. Commencing 3-4 days after the luteinizing hormone (LH) peak and 
      continuing into the late secretory phase, secretory MUC1 appears in gland lumens. 
      Uterine flushings were collected as a function of time after the LH peak and were 
      analysed using a two-site enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for MUC1. Low but 
      measurable concentrations were observed up to day 7, while on days 7-13 much 
      higher values were obtained. In women suffering from recurrent spontaneous 
      miscarriage, the concentration of MUC1 in flushings was significantly lower than 
      in the controls on day LH + 10. Lower values were observed on days 7 and 13. 
      Reduced epithelial secretory function and a resultant change in uterine fluid 
      composition are features of endometrium from recurrent miscarriage patients.

      determinant (PND) of HIV-1 (MN) (GPGRA). A panel of 120 residue, six tandem 
      repeat (TR) and 60 residue, three TR chimeric antigens were constructed in which 
      the repeating MUC1 epitope is replaced by HIV-1 PND. Each 20 residue TR contains 
      one PND epitope. The PND of HIV-1 is presented in the native beta-turn 
      conformation at the crest of each repeating knob structure of the mucin-like 
      protein. METHODS: The antigenicity of the chimeric antigens were compared using 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and HIV-infected patient sera. 
      Structural effects of antibody-antigen interactions were determined using surface 
      plasmon resonance, with human monoclonal antibodies, chimeric antigens and the 
      cyclic and linear V3 loops. Immunogenicity of three versus six TR was measured in 
      mice. RESULTS: Nine residues of the HIV PND substituted into the mucin backbone 
      were equivalent to the 36 residue cyclic V3 loop in ELISA. The 120 residue 
      antigens induced high titer, immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG, and HIV-specific 
      antibodies in mice. CONCLUSIONS: MUC1/V3 chimeras efficiently detect HIV-specific 
      antibodies in patient sera. Multivalent presentation of the PND is advantageous 
      for higher affinity antibody-antigen interactions and for inducing HIV-specific 
      IgM and IgG antibodies.

TI  - DNA methylation status of the MUC1 gene coding for a breast-cancer-associated 
      protein.
PG  - 245-51
AB  - The MUC1 gene codes for protein products that are highly expressed in human 
      breast-cancer tissue and that serve as tumor markers for disease progression. The 
      factors contributing to the disease-specific over-expression of the MUC1 gene are 
      under intensive investigation and are yet to be determined. A large transcribed 
      region of the human MUC1 gene is a CpG island that consists of 60-bp tandemly 
      repeating units, each of which contains one SmaI restriction site. The 
      methylation status of regulatory regions, upstream to the transcriptional start 
      site, is essential for the regulation of gene expression. We therefore evaluated 
      whether the methylation status of the various regions of the MUC1 gene may affect 
      its expression. Using SmaI, and its isoschizomer XmaI endonucleases, we 
      demonstrated that in peripheral-blood leukocytes (PBL-DNA) that do not express 
      the MUC1 gene, the repeat array is completely methylated, whereas the same 
      sequences are entirely non-methylated in breast-tumor-tissue DNA (BT-DNA). In 
      contrast, sequences upstream and downstream to the repeat array showed no 
      difference in the methylation pattern in PBL-DNA and BT-DNA. Hypomethylation 
      within the repeat array was also observed in other epithelial tissues that 
      express the MUC1 gene at much lower levels to those seen in breast-cancer tissue. 
      These studies demonstrate that hypomethylation of the tandem repeat array is an 
      absolute requirement for MUC1 gene expression in epithelial tissues, although in 
      breast-cancer tissue additional regulatory mechanisms must pertain for its 
      over-expression.

TI  - Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigens: structure and serology of 
      multivalent human mucin MUC1-HIV V3 chimeric proteins.
PG  - 315-9
AB  - Molecular modeling and two-dimensional NMR techniques enable us to identify 
      structural features in the third variable region (V3) loop of the human 
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) surface glycoprotein gp120, in particular the 
      principal neutralizing determinant (PND), that remain conserved despite the 
      sequence variation. The conserved structure of the PND is a solvent-accessible 
      protruding motif or a knob, structurally isomorphous with the immunodominant 
      knobs in the tandem repeat protein of human mucin 1 (MUC1) (a tumor antigen for 
      breast, pancreatic, and ovarian cancer). We have replaced the mucin antigenic 
      knobs by the PND knobs of the HIV MN isolate in a set of chimeric human MUC1/HIV 
      V3 antigens. This produced multivalent HIV antigens in which PNDs are located at 
      regular intervals and separated by extended mucin spacers. In this article we 
      show by two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy that the multivalent antigens preserve 
      the PNDs in their native structure. We also demonstrate by ELISA that the 
      antigens correctly present the PNDs for binding to monoclonal antibodies or 
      polyclonal antisera from HIV-infected patients.

TI  - Quantitation of mucin mRNA in respiratory and intestinal epithelial cells.
PG  - 742-50
AB  - Mucin glycoproteins (mucins) are the major macromolecular constituents of mucus 
      gels in mammalian respiratory, gastrointestinal, and reproductive tracts. 
      Disorders of mucin glycosylation, which may result from either abnormal 
      post-translational processing or differences in mucin protein gene expression, 
      have been indicated in several diseases. Quantitation of mucin gene expression 
      has been hindered by two features of human mucin genes: variable numbers of 
      tandemly repeating nucleotides per mRNA molecule and polydisperse mRNA 
      transcripts. We report here a method to quantitate mucin mRNA levels in 
      epithelial cells and have evaluated three mucin genes, MUC1, MUC2, and MUC5, 
      which are expressed in respiratory epithelium. The method uses the 3' non-tandem 
      repeat mucin cDNA sequences, as they were shown to have a single-size transcript 
      when amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, consistent with a one-to-one 
      relationship with the mRNA molecule. The 3' non-tandem repeat cDNA sequences were 
      cloned and transcribed in vitro to prepare complementary RNA (cRNA) standards. By 
      comparison to a cRNA standard curve, mucin gene expression was evaluated in colon 
      adenocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and transformed respiratory epithelial 
      cells and in nasal polyp tissue by slot blot analysis. CFPAC-1, a pancreatic 
      adenocarcinoma cell line, expressed the highest MUC1 transcript levels. Colon 
      adenocarcinoma cell lines varied in MUC2 expression levels, and one colon 
      adenocarcinoma cell line, HT-29, had higher levels of MUC5 than MUC2. Nasal polyp 
      tissue expressed more MUC5 mRNA than MUC1 or MUC2 mRNA. This mucin mRNA slot blot 
      method provides a quantitative method for investigating the regulation of mucin 
      gene expression in health and disease.

TI  - Humoral immunity against a tandem repeat epitope of human mucin MUC-1 in sera 
      from breast, pancreatic, and colon cancer patients.
PG  - 2856-60
AB  - Using synthetic peptides 60,80, and 105 residues long, corresponding to 3, 4, and 
      5.25 tandem repeats of human mucin MUC-1 protein core, as antigens in a 
      solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we screened sera from 24 breast 
      cancer patients, 10 colon cancer patients, and 12 pancreatic cancer patients, at 
      various stages of disease, for the presence of mucin-specific antibodies. The 
      105-residue peptide was superior in allowing detection of high levels of 
      anti-mucin antibodies in 10.9% of sera in each cancer group. Another 4.3% showed 
      intermediate reactivity. Lower levels of detection were achieved with the 
      80-residue peptide, and no specific reactivity was detectable with the 60-residue 
      peptide. Anti-mucin antibodies were previously undetectable when this assay was 
      performed with purified whole mucin or short synthetic peptides. The presence or 
      absence of antibody did not correlate with the levels of circulating mucin or 
      stage of disease. One highly reactive serum sample was used to identify more 
      precisely the epitope on the long synthetic peptide to which the reactivity was 
      directed. The reactivity of this serum specific for the 105-residue peptide was 
      blocked by a 9-residue peptide from the NH2-terminal region of the 20-residue 
      tandem repeat containing the previously identified immunogenic epitope APDTRP. 
      Another 9-residue mucin peptide, from the COOH-terminal region of the tandem 
      repeat which does not contain the APDTRP epitope, had no effect. All the 
      mucin-specific reactivity was found to be of the IgM isotype, indicating a helper 
      T-cell-independent response, unusual for an antibody against a peptide epitope, 
      but not unexpected for tandemly repeated epitopes.

TI  - Specific and effective T-cell recognition of cells transfected with a truncated 
      human mucin cDNA.
PG  - 231-43
AB  - Epithelial cell mucin has been characterized as a tumor-specific antigen in 
      patients with pancreatic and breast cancer. Mucins are high molecular weight 
      glycoproteins consisting of a heavily glycosylated tandemly repeating 20-amino 
      acid sequence. Aberrant glycosylation of mucins on carcinomatous epithelial cells 
      leads to the exposure of novel core epitopes that are recognized by cytotoxic T 
      lymphocytes (CTLs). We previously reported the establishment of mucin-specific 
      CTL clones that recognize mucin expressed on the surface of EBV-immortalized B 
      cells transfected with the mucin cDNA (MUC1). This recognition was characterized 
      as major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-unrestricted, because of the 
      multivalent nature of mucin. The transfectants had to be incubated with an 
      inhibitor of O-linked glycosylation, phenyl-N-acetyl-alpha-galactosaminide 
      (phenyl-GalNAc) in order to unmask the tandem repeat core epitope recognized by 
      CTLs. In the present study, we examined whether mucin molecules with fewer tandem 
      repeats are capable of MHC-unrestricted recognition by mucin-specific CTL clones. 
      A mucin cDNA expression vector expressing a "truncated" mucin molecule that 
      contains only two tandem repeats was constructed. We found that mucin-specific 
      CTL clones recognize the "truncated" mucin on allogeneic target cells, showing 
      that recognition in this case was MHC-unrestricted as well. In addition, CTL 
      clones lysed "truncated" mucin transfectants significantly better than 
      full-length mucin transfectants treated with phenyl-GalNAc, and controls. The 
      "truncated" construct may represent an effective means of immunizing patients 
      with breast and pancreatic cancer, enabling them to mount a strong and efficient 
      immune response against mucin-bearing tumor cells.

TI  - Detection of a circulating antibody against a peptide epitope on a mucin core 
      protein, MUC1, in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 163-8
AB  - This study aims at clarifying whether the humoral immune response to the tandem 
      repeat domain of MUC1 can be induced or not in vivo. The expression of MUC1 mRNA 
      in the colon was revealed by Northern blot analysis, and cDNA cloning of an 
      extracellular tandemly repeated domain of MUC1 was then performed to prepare the 
      recombinant MUC1 protein. A cDNA clone coding for ten repeat domains was ligated 
      into an expression vector in prokaryotes, resulting in a recombinant protein 
      which could react with the MAb MUSE11 against an adenocarcinoma-associated 
      antigen whose epitope has been shown to be localized in the tandem repeat domain 
      on MUC1. The reactivity of sera from patients with ulcerative colitis with the 
      recombinant protein was evaluated by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis to detect 
      the antibodies against this tandem repeat domain. Five out of 19 serum samples 
      tested positive, and these reactions were totally inhibited by MAb MUSE11, 
      suggesting that the epitope recognized by these antibodies in sera is almost 
      identical to that recognized by MAb MUSE11. The data represent the first 
      demonstration of antibody production against a peptide epitope of the tandem 
      repeat domain of MUC1.
