AB  - BACKGROUND: A male individual with a karyotype of 46,XX is very rare. We explored 
      the genetic aetiology of an infertility male with a kayrotype of 46,XX and SRY 
      negative. METHODS: The peripheral blood sample was collected from the patient and 
      subjected to a few genetic testing, including chromosomal karyotyping, 
      azoospermia factor (AZF) deletion, short tandem repeat (STR) analysis for AMELX, 
      AMELY and SRY, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with specific probes for 
      CSP 18/CSP X/CSP Y/SRY, chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) for genomic copy 
      number variations(CNVs), whole-genome analysis(WGA) for genomic SNV&InDel 
      mutation, and X chromosome inactivation (XCI) analysis. RESULTS: The patient had 
      a karyotype of 46,XX. AZF analysis showed that he missed the AZF region 
      (including a, b and c) and SRY gene. STR assay revealed he possessed the AMELX in 
      the X chromosome, but he had no the AMELY and SRY in the Y chromosome. FISH 
      analysis with CSP X/CSP Y/SRY showed only two X centromeric signals, but none Y 
      chromosome and SRY. The above results of the karyotype, FISH and STR analysis did 
      not suggest a Y chromosome chimerism existed in the patient's peripheral blood. 
      The result of the CMA indicated a heterozygous deletion with an approximate size 
      of 867 kb in Xq27.1 (hg19: chrX: 138,612,879-139,480,163 bp), located at 104 kb 
      downstream of SOX3 gene, including F9, CXorf66, MCF2 and ATP11C. WGA also 
      displayed the above deletion fragment but did not present known pathogenic or 
      likely pathogenic SNV&InDel mutation responsible for sex determination and 
      development. XCI assay showed that he had about 75% of the X chromosome 
      inactivated. CONCLUSIONS: Although the pathogenicity of 46,XX male patients with 
      SRY negative remains unclear, SOX3 expression of the acquired function may be 
      associated with partial testis differentiation of these patients. Therefore, the 
      CNVs analysis of the SOX3 gene and its regulatory region should be performed 
      routinely for these patients.

TI  - Polyalanine expansions drive a shift into alpha-helical clusters without 
      amyloid-fibril formation.
PG  - 1008-15
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3127 [doi]
AB  - Polyglutamine (polyGln) expansions in nine human proteins result in neurological 
      diseases and induce the proteins' tendency to form beta-rich amyloid fibrils and 
      intracellular deposits. Less well known are at least nine other human diseases 
      caused by polyalanine (polyAla)-expansion mutations in different proteins. The 
      mechanisms of how polyAla aggregates under physiological conditions remain 
      unclear and controversial. We show here that aggregation of polyAla is 
      mechanistically dissimilar to that of polyGln and hence does not exhibit amyloid 
      kinetics. PolyAla assembled spontaneously into alpha-helical clusters with diverse 
      oligomeric states. Such clustering was pervasive in cells irrespective of visible 
      aggregate formation, and it disrupted the normal physiological oligomeric state 
      of two human proteins natively containing polyAla: ARX and SOX3. This 
      self-assembly pattern indicates that polyAla expansions chronically disrupt 
      protein behavior by imposing a deranged oligomeric status.

AB  - Polyalanine expansions in transcription factors have been associated with eight 
      distinct congenital human diseases. It is thought that in each case the 
      polyalanine expansion causes misfolding of the protein that abrogates protein 
      function. Misfolded proteins form aggregates when expressed in vitro; however, it 
      is less clear whether aggregation is of relevance to these diseases in vivo. To 
      investigate this issue, we used targeted mutagenesis of embryonic stem (ES) cells 
      to generate mice with a polyalanine expansion mutation in Sox3 (Sox3-26ala) that 
      is associated with X-linked Hypopituitarism (XH) in humans. By investigating both 
      ES cells and chimeric mice, we show that endogenous polyalanine expanded SOX3 
      does not form protein aggregates in vivo but rather is present at dramatically 
      reduced levels within the nucleus of mutant cells. Importantly, the residual 
      mutant protein of chimeric embryos is able to rescue a block in gastrulation but 
      is not sufficient for normal development of the hypothalamus, a region that is 
      functionally compromised in Sox3 null embryos and individuals with XH. Together, 
      these data provide the first definitive example of a disease-relevant PA mutant 
      protein that is both nuclear and functional, thereby manifesting as a partial 
      loss-of-function allele.

AB  - To understand more fully the structure and evolution of the SOX3 protein, we 
      comparatively analyzed its orthologs in vertebrates. Since complex disorders are 
      associated with human SOX3 polyalanine expansions, our investigation focused on 
      both compositional and evolutionary analysis of various homopolymeric amino acid 
      tracts observed in SOX3 orthologs. Our analysis revealed that the observed 
      homopolymeric alanine, glycine, and proline tracts are mammal-specific, except 
      for one polyglycine tract present in birds. Since it is likely that the SOX3 
      protein acquired additional roles in brain development in Eutheria, we might 
      speculate that development of novel brain functions during the course of 
      evolution was affected, at least in part, by such structural-functional changes 
      in the SOX3 protein.

TI  - Polyalanine expansion mutations in the X-linked hypopituitarism gene SOX3 result 
      in aggresome formation and impaired transactivation.
PG  - 2085-95
AB  - Polyalanine expansion mutations have been identified in eight transcription 
      factors that are associated with a range of congenital disorders. While some of 
      these mutant proteins have been shown to generate cellular aggregates in 
      heterologous cell lines, little is known about the mechanism by which these 
      aggregates cause disease. Here we examine the aggregation and functional 
      properties of the two known polyalanine expansion mutations associated with 
      X-linked Hypopituitarism (XH), SOX3(22Ala) and SOX3(26Ala), which contain an 
      additional seven and eleven alanine residues, respectively. SOX3(22Ala) and 
      SOX3(26Ala) proteins form cytoplasmic aggregates and nuclear inclusions in 
      transiently transfected COS-7 and CHO K1 cells, and in transfected explant 
      cultures of chick neural epithelium. SOX3(26Ala) exhibits a more potent 
      aggregation phenotype, resulting in significantly more cells with dispersed 
      cytoplasmic and large perinuclear aggregates. SOX3(22Ala) and SOX3(26Ala) protein 
      aggregates exhibit the key properties of aggresomes including vimentin 
      redistribution, colocalisation with the Microtubule Organising Centre and 
      sensitivity to microtubule disruption. This is the first time that aggresomes 
      have been implicated in the aetiology of a polyalanine expansion disorder, 
      suggesting that XH and protein conformation disorders may become manifest through 
      similar pathological mechanisms. Further, we show that mutant SOX3 proteins have 
      impaired transcriptional activity and reduced capacity to inhibit 
      beta-catenin/TCF-mediated transcription. These data suggest that deregulation of 
      SOX3 target genes and inappropriate canonical Wnt signaling in central nervous 
      system (CNS) progenitors may also contribute to dysfunction of the 
      hypothalamic-pituitary axis in XH patients.
