TI  - Investigating Repeat Expansions in NIPA1, NOP56, and NOTCH2NLC Genes: A Closer 
      Look at Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Patients from Southern Italy.

AB  - The discovery of hexanucleotide repeats expansion (RE) in Chromosome 9 Open 
      Reading frame 72 (C9orf72) as the major genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS) and the association between intermediate repeats in Ataxin-2 
      (ATXN2) with the disorder suggest that repetitive sequences in the human genome 
      play a significant role in ALS pathophysiology. Investigating the frequency of 
      repeat expansions in ALS in different populations and ethnic groups is therefore 
      of great importance. Based on these premises, this study aimed to define the 
      frequency of REs in the NIPA1, NOP56, and NOTCH2NLC genes and the possible 
      associations between phenotypes and the size of REs in the Italian population. 
      Using repeat-primed-PCR and PCR-fragment analyses, we screened 302 
      El-Escorial-diagnosed ALS patients and compared the RE distribution to 167 age-, 
      gender-, and ethnicity-matched healthy controls. While the REs distribution was 
      similar between the ALS and control groups, a moderate association was observed 
      between longer RE lengths and clinical features such as age at onset, gender, 
      site of onset, and family history. In conclusion, this is the first study to 
      screen ALS patients from southern Italy for REs in NIPA1, NOP56, and NOTCH2NLC 
      genes, contributing to our understanding of ALS genetics. Our results highlighted 
      that the extremely rare pathogenic REs in these genes do not allow an association 
      with the disease.

TI  - Genetic variability in sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

AB  - With the advent of gene therapies for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), there 
      is a surge in gene testing for this disease. Although there is ample experience 
      with gene testing for C9orf72, SOD1, FUS and TARDBP in familial ALS, large 
      studies exploring genetic variation in all ALS-associated genes in sporadic ALS 
      (sALS) are still scarce. Gene testing in a diagnostic setting is challenging, 
      given the complex genetic architecture of sALS, for which there are genetic 
      variants with large and small effect sizes. Guidelines for the interpretation of 
      genetic variants in gene panels and for counselling of patients are lacking. We 
      aimed to provide a thorough characterization of genetic variability in ALS genes 
      by applying the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) criteria 
      on whole genome sequencing data from a large cohort of 6013 sporadic ALS patients 
      and 2411 matched controls from Project MinE. We studied genetic variation in 90 
      ALS-associated genes and applied customized ACMG-criteria to identify pathogenic 
      and likely pathogenic variants. Variants of unknown significance were collected 
      as well. In addition, we determined the length of repeat expansions in C9orf72, 
      ATXN1, ATXN2 and NIPA1 using the ExpansionHunter tool. We found C9orf72 repeat 
      expansions in 5.21% of sALS patients. In 50 ALS-associated genes, we did not 
      identify any pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. In 5.89%, a pathogenic or 
      likely pathogenic variant was found, most commonly in SOD1, TARDBP, FUS, NEK1, 
      OPTN or TBK1. Significantly more cases carried at least one pathogenic or likely 
      pathogenic variant compared to controls (odds ratio 1.75; P-value 1.64 x 10-5). 
      Isolated risk factors in ATXN1, ATXN2, NIPA1 and/or UNC13A were detected in 
      17.33% of cases. In 71.83%, we did not find any genetic clues. A combination of 
      variants was found in 2.88%. This study provides an inventory of pathogenic and 
      likely pathogenic genetic variation in a large cohort of sALS patients. Overall, 
      we identified pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in 11.13% of ALS patients 
      in 38 known ALS genes. In line with the oligogenic hypothesis, we found 
      significantly more combinations of variants in cases compared to controls. Many 
      variants of unknown significance may contribute to ALS risk, but diagnostic 
      algorithms to reliably identify and weigh them are lacking. This work can serve 
      as a resource for counselling and for the assembly of gene panels for ALS. 
      Further characterization of the genetic architecture of sALS is necessary given 
      the growing interest in gene testing in ALS.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating, heterogeneous 
      neurodegenerative neuromuscular disease that leads to a fatal outcome within 
      2-5 years, and yet, a precise nature of the association between its major 
      phenotypes and the cerebellar role in ALS pathology remains unknown. Recently, 
      repeat expansions in several genes in which variants appreciably contribute to 
      cerebellar pathology, including C9orf72, NIPA1, ATXN2 and ATXN1, have been found 
      to confer a significant risk for ALS. To better define this relationship, we 
      performed MAGMA gene-based analysis and tissue enrichment analysis using 
      genome-wide association study summary statistics based on a study of 27,205 
      people with ALS and 110,881 controls. Our preliminary results imply a striking 
      cerebellar tissue specificity and further support increasing calls for 
      re-evaluation of the cerebellar role in the ALS pathology.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease 
      characterized primarily by progressive loss of motor neurons. Although ALS occurs 
      worldwide and the frequency and spectrum of identifiable genetic causes of 
      disease varies across populations, very few studies have included African 
      subjects. In addition to a hexanucleotide repeat expansion (RE) in C9orf72, the 
      most common genetic cause of ALS in Europeans, REs in ATXN2, NIPA1 and ATXN1 have 
      shown variable associations with ALS in Europeans. Intermediate range expansions 
      in some of these genes (e.g. ATXN2) have been reported as potential risk factors, 
      or phenotypic modifiers, of ALS. Pathogenic expansions in NOP56 cause 
      spinocerebellar ataxia-36, which can present with prominent motor neuron 
      degeneration. Here we compare REs in these genes in a cohort of Africans with ALS 
      and population controls using whole genome sequencing data. Targeting genotyping 
      of short tandem repeats at known loci within ATXN2, NIPA1, ATXN1 and NOP56 was 
      performed using ExpansionHunter software in 105 Southern African (SA) patients 
      with ALS. African population controls were from an in-house SA population control 
      database (n = 25), the SA Human Genome Program (n = 24), the Simons Genome 
      Diversity Project (n = 39) and the Illumina Polaris Diversity Cohort (IPDC) 
      dataset (n = 50). We found intermediate RE alleles in ATXN2 (27-33 repeats) and 
      ATXN1 (33-35 repeats), and NIPA1 long alleles (>/=8 repeats) were rare in Africans, 
      and not associated with ALS (p > 0.17). NOP56 showed no expanded alleles in 
      either ALS or controls. We also compared the differences in allele distributions 
      between the African and n = 50 European controls (from the IPDC). There was a 
      statistical significant difference in the distribution of the REs in the ATXN1 
      between African and European controls (Chi-test p < 0.001), and NIPA1 showed 
      proportionately more longer alleles (RE > 8) in Europeans vs. Africans (Fisher's 
      p = 0.016). The distribution of RE alleles in ATXN2 and NOP56 were similar 
      amongst African and European controls. In conclusion, repeat expansions in ATXN2, 
      NIPA1 and ATXN1, which showed associations with ALS in Europeans, were not 
      replicated in Southern Africans with ALS.

AB  - Genetic isolates are compelling tools for mapping genes of inherited disorders. 
      The archipelago of Malta, a sovereign microstate in the south of Europe is home 
      to a geographically and culturally isolated population. Here, we investigate the 
      epidemiology and genetic profile of Maltese patients with amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS), identified throughout a 2-year window. Cases were largely male 
      (66.7%) with a predominant spinal onset of symptoms (70.8%). Disease onset 
      occurred around mid-age (median age: 64 years, men; 59.5 years, female); 12.5% 
      had familial ALS (fALS). Annual incidence rate was 2.48 (95% CI 1.59-3.68) per 
      100,000 person-years. Male-to-female incidence ratio was 1.93:1. Prevalence was 
      3.44 (95% CI 2.01-5.52) cases per 100,000 inhabitants on 31(st) December 2018. 
      Whole-genome sequencing allowed us to determine rare DNA variants that change the 
      protein-coding sequence of ALS-associated genes. Interestingly, the Maltese ALS 
      patient cohort was found to be negative for deleterious variants in C9orf72, 
      SOD1, TARDBP or FUS genes, which are the most commonly mutated ALS genes 
      globally. Nonetheless, ALS-associated repeat expansions were identified in ATXN2 
      and NIPA1. Variants predicted to be damaging were also detected in ALS2, DAO, 
      DCTN1, ERBB4, SETX, SCFD1 and SPG11. A total of 40% of patients with sporadic ALS 
      had a rare and deleterious variant or repeat expansion in an ALS-associated gene, 
      whilst the genetic cause of two thirds of fALS cases could not be pinpointed to 
      known ALS genes or risk loci. This warrants further studies to elucidate novel 
      genes that cause ALS in this unique population isolate.

AB  - Increasingly, repeat expansions are being identified as part of the complex 
      genetic architecture of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. To date, several repeat 
      expansions have been genetically associated with the disease: intronic repeat 
      expansions in C9orf72, polyglutamine expansions in ATXN2 and polyalanine 
      expansions in NIPA1. Together with previously published data, the identification 
      of an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patient with a family history of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, caused by polyglutamine expansions in ATXN1, 
      suggested a similar disease association for the repeat expansion in ATXN1. We, 
      therefore, performed a large-scale international study in 11 700 individuals, in 
      which we showed a significant association between intermediate ATXN1 repeat 
      expansions and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (P = 3.33 x 10(-7)). Subsequent 
      functional experiments have shown that ATXN1 reduces the nucleocytoplasmic ratio 
      of TDP-43 and enhances amyotrophic lateral sclerosis phenotypes in Drosophila, 
      further emphasizing the role of polyglutamine repeat expansions in the 
      pathophysiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

TI  - Analysis of the GCG repeat length in NIPA1 gene in C9orf72-mediated ALS in a 
      large Italian ALS cohort.
PG  - 2537-2540
LID - 10.1007/s10072-019-04001-3 [doi]
AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by degeneration of upper and 
      lower motor neurons. The hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9orf72 gene 
      (C9orf72-HRE) is the most frequent genetic cause of ALS. Since many ALS pedigrees 
      showed incomplete penetrance, several genes have been analyzed as possible 
      modifiers. Length of the GCG repeat tract in NIPA1 (non-imprinted in 
      Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome 1) gene has been recently investigated as a 
      possible modifier factor for C9orf72-HRE patients with contrasting findings. To 
      disclose the possible role of NIPA1 GCG repeat length as modifier of the disease 
      risk in C9orf72-HRE carriers, we analyzed a large cohort of 532 Italian ALS cases 
      enriched in C9orf72-HRE carriers (172 cases) and 483 Italian controls. This 
      sample size is powered (92% power, p = 0.05) to replicate the modifier effect 
      observed in literature. We did not observe higher frequency of NIPA1 long alleles 
      (> 8 GCG) in C9orf72-HRE carriers (3.5%) compared with C9orf72-HRE negative 
      patients (4.1%) and healthy controls (5%). For the latter comparison, we 
      meta-analyzed our data with currently available literature data, and no 
      statistically significant effect was observed (p = 0.118). In conclusion, we did 
      not confirm a role of NIPA1 repeat length as a modifier of the C9orf72 ALS 
      disease risk.

AB  - NIPA1 (nonimprinted in Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome 1) mutations are known to 
      cause hereditary spastic paraplegia type 6, a neurodegenerative disease that 
      phenotypically overlaps to some extent with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). 
      Previously, a genomewide screen for copy number variants found an association 
      with rare deletions in NIPA1 and ALS, and subsequent genetic analyses revealed 
      that long (or expanded) polyalanine repeats in NIPA1 convey increased ALS 
      susceptibility. We set out to perform a large-scale replication study to further 
      investigate the role of NIPA1 polyalanine expansions with ALS, in which we 
      characterized NIPA1 repeat size in an independent international cohort of 3955 
      patients with ALS and 2276 unaffected controls and combined our results with 
      previous reports. Meta-analysis on a total of 6245 patients with ALS and 5051 
      controls showed an overall increased risk of ALS in those with expanded (>8) GCG 
      repeat length (odds ratio = 1.50, p = 3.8x10(-5)). Together with previous 
      reports, these findings provide evidence for an association of an expanded 
      polyalanine repeat in NIPA1 and ALS.

AB  - Sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is considered to be a complex 
      disease with multiple genetic risk factors contributing to the pathogenesis. 
      Identification of genetic risk factors that co-occur frequently could provide 
      relevant insight into underlying mechanisms of motor neuron degeneration. To 
      dissect the genetic architecture of sporadic ALS, we undertook a large sequencing 
      study in 755 apparently sporadic ALS cases and 959 controls, analyzing 10 ALS 
      genes: SOD1, C9orf72, TARDBP, FUS, ANG, CHMP2B, ATXN2, NIPA1, SMN1, and UNC13A. 
      We observed sporadic cases with multiple genetic risk variants in 4.1% compared 
      with 1.3% in controls. The overall difference was not in excess of what is to be 
      expected by chance (binomial test, p = 0.59). We did, however, observe a higher 
      frequency than expected of C9orf72 repeat carriers with co-occurring 
      susceptibility variants (ATXN2, NIPA1, and SMN1; p = 0.001), which is mainly 
      because of the co-occurrence of NIPA1 repeats in 15% of C9orf72 repeat carriers 
      (p = 0.006).

AB  - Repeat expansions in chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72) are an 
      important cause of both motor neuron disease (MND) and frontotemporal dementia 
      (FTD). Currently, little is known about factors that could account for the 
      phenotypic heterogeneity detected in C9ORF72 expansion carriers. In this study, 
      we investigated 4 genes that could represent genetic modifiers: ataxin-2 (ATXN2), 
      non-imprinted in Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome 1 (NIPA1), survival motor neuron 
      1 (SMN1), and survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2). Assessment of these genes, in a 
      unique cohort of 331 C9ORF72 expansion carriers and 376 control subjects, 
      revealed that intermediate repeat lengths in ATXN2 possibly act as disease 
      modifier in C9ORF72 expansion carriers; no evidence was provided for a potential 
      role of NIPA1, SMN1, or SMN2. The effects of intermediate ATXN2 repeats were most 
      profound in probands with MND or FTD/MND (2.1% vs. 0% in control subjects, p = 
      0.013), whereas the frequency in probands with FTD was identical to control 
      subjects. Though intermediate ATXN2 repeats were already known to be associated 
      with MND risk, previous reports did not focus on individuals with clear 
      pathogenic mutations, such as repeat expansions in C9ORF72. Based on our present 
      findings, we postulate that intermediate ATXN2 repeat lengths may render C9ORF72 
      expansion carriers more susceptible to the development of MND; further studies 
      are needed, however, to validate our findings.

TI  - NIPA1 polyalanine repeat expansions are associated with amyotrophic lateral

PG  - 2497-502
LID - 10.1093/hmg/dds064 [doi]
AB  - Mutations in NIPA1 cause Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia type 6, a 
      neurodegenerative disease characterized by an (upper) motor neuron phenotype. 
      Deletions of NIPA1 have been associated with a higher susceptibility to 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The exact role of genetic variation in NIPA1 
      in ALS susceptibility and disease course is, however, not known. We sequenced the 
      entire coding sequence of NIPA1 and genotyped a polyalanine repeat located in the 
      first exon of NIPA1. A total of 2292 ALS patients and 2777 controls from three 
      independent European populations were included. We identified two sequence 
      variants that have a potentially damaging effect on NIPA1 protein function. Both 
      variants were identified in ALS patients; no damaging variants were found in 
      controls. Secondly, we found a significant effect of 'long' polyalanine repeat 
      alleles on disease susceptibility: odds ratio = 1.71, P = 1.6 x 10(-4). Our 
      analyses also revealed a significant effect of 'long' alleles on patient survival 
      [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.60, P = 4.2 x 10(-4)] and on the age at onset of symptoms 
      (HR = 1.37, P = 4.6 x 10(-3)). In patients carrying 'long' alleles, median 
      survival was 3 months shorter than patients with 'normal' genotypes and onset of 
      symptoms occurred 3.6 years earlier. Our data show that NIPA1 polyalanine repeat 
      expansions are a common risk factor for ALS and modulate disease course.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hereditary spastic paraplegia type 6 (SPG6) is caused by mutations in 
      the NIPA1 gene, this is a rare cause of HSP, until now, all the affected 
      individuals reported displayed "pure" spastic paraplegia. OBJECTIVES: To analyze 
      the genotype/phenotype correlation of mutations so far described in NIPA1. 
      METHODS: Eighty-six Chinese Han HSP patients were investigated for SPG6 mutations 
      by direct sequencing of the NIPA1 gene. RESULTS: One heterozygous missense 
      mutation c.316G>C/p.G106R was identified in a complicated form of ADHSP family 
      with peripheral nerves disease, and SPG6 mutation in our sample accounted for 
      3.6% (1/28) of ADHSP families and 1.1% (1/86) of non-ARHSP patients who were 
      negative for SPG4, SPG3A and SPG31 mutations. CONCLUSIONS: We report the first 
      complicated case of SPG6 in the world by the presence of peripheral neuropathy, 
      which extends the phenotype initially described.

TI  - Spastic paraplegia, ataxia, mental retardation (SPAR): a novel genetic disorder.
PG  - 411-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a kindred with a dominantly inherited neurologic disorder 
      manifested either as uncomplicated spastic paraplegia or ataxia, spastic 
      paraplegia, and mental retardation. METHODS: Neurologic examinations and 
      molecular genetic analysis (exclusion of known SCA and HSP genes and loci; and 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion detection [RED]) were performed in six affected 
      and four unaffected subjects in this family. MRI, electromyography (EMG), and 
      nerve conduction studies were performed in three affected subjects. RESULTS: The 
      phenotype of this dominantly inherited syndrome varied in succeeding generations. 
      Pure spastic paraplegia was present in the earliest generation; subsequent 
      generations had ataxia and mental retardation. MRI showed marked atrophy of the 
      spinal cord in all patients and cerebellar atrophy in those with ataxia. 
      Laboratory analysis showed that the disorder was not caused by mutations in genes 
      that cause SCA-1, SCA-2, SCA-3, SCA-6, SCA-7, SCA-8, and SCA-12; not linked to 
      other known loci for autosomal dominant ataxia (SCA-4, SCA-5, SCA-10, SCA-11, 
      SCA-13, SCA-14, and SCA-16); and not linked to known loci for autosomal dominant 
      hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) (SPG-3, SPG-4, SPG-6, SPG-8, SPG-9, SPG-10, 
      SPG-12, and SPG-13) or autosomal recessive HSP SPG-7. Analysis of 
      intergenerational differences in age at onset of symptoms suggests genetic 
      anticipation. Using RED, the authors did not detect expanded CAG, CCT, TGG, or 
      CGT repeats that segregate with the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The authors describe an 
      unusual, dominantly inherited neurologic disorder in which the phenotype (pure 
      spastic paraplegia or spastic ataxia with variable mental retardation) differed 
      in subsequent generations. The molecular explanation for apparent genetic 
      anticipation does not appear to involve trinucleotide repeat expansion.

TI  - Isolation of CAG/CTG repeats from within the chromosome 2p21-p24 locus for 
      autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia (SPG4) by YAC fragmentation.
PG  - 217-25
AB  - Pure autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia (SPG) is a genetically heterogeneous 
      neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system clinically characterized 
      by progressive spasticity mainly affecting the lower limbs. Three distinct loci 
      have been mapped to chromosomes 14q (SPG3), 2p (SPG4) and 15q (SPG6). In 
      particular, SPG4 families show striking intrafamilial variability suggestive of 
      anticipation and evidence has been provided that CAG/CTG repeat expansions may be 
      involved. To isolate CAG/CTG repeat containing sequences from within the SPG4 
      candidate region, a novel approach was developed. Fragmentation vectors were 
      assembled allowing direct fragmentation of yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) 
      with a short (> or = 21 bp) CAG/CTG sequence as the target site for homologous 
      recombination. We used the CAG/CTG YAC fragmentation vectors to isolate CAG/CTG 
      containing sequences from four YACs spanning the SPG4 candidate region between 
      D2S400 and D2S367. A total of four CAG/CTG containing sequences were isolated of 
      which three were novel. However, none of the four CAG/CTG repeats showed expanded 
      alleles in two Belgian SPG4 families. In addition, we showed that the CAG/CTG 
      alleles detected by the repeat expansion detection (RED) method could be fully 
      explained by two polymorphic nonpathogenic CAG/CTG repeats on chromosomes 17 and 
      18, respectively. Also, the RED expansions in six SPG families could not be 
      explained by amplification of the CAG/CTG repeats at the SPG4 locus. Together, 
      our data do not support the hypothesis of a CAG/CTG repeat expansion as the 
      molecular mechanism underlying SPG4 pathology.

TI  - CAG repeat expansion in autosomal dominant familial spastic paraparesis: novel 
      expansion in a subset of patients.
PG  - 1779-86
AB  - Autosomal dominant familial spastic paraplegia (FSP) is a genetically 
      heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder displaying anticipation for which three 
      loci have been mapped to the chromosomal positions 14q11.2-q24.3 (SPG3), 2p21-p24 
      (SPG4) and 15q11.1 (SPG6). The repeat expansion detection (RED) method has been 
      used to demonstrate expanded CAG repeats in some FSP families that map to SPG4. 
      We analyzed 20 FSP families, including four for which there is evidence for 
      linkage to SPG4, and found that in most cases the repeat expansion detected by 
      RED is due to non-pathogenic expansions of the chromosome 18q21.1 SEF2-1 or 
      17q21.3 ERDA1 locus. Polymorphic expansions at SEF2-1 and ERDA1 appear frequent 
      and may confound RED studies in the search for genes causing disorders 
      demonstrating anticipation. In six FSP families, however, CAG repeat expansion 
      was detected in a subset of affected and at-risk individuals that did not result 
      from expansion of the SEF2-1 and ERDA1 loci. Overall, 11 of 37 (30%) of the FSP 
      patients with a CAG/CTG repeat expansion are unaccounted for by the SEF2-1 and 
      ERDA1 loci, compared with two of 23 (9%) of the unaffected at-risk individuals 
      and none of 19 controls. In the majority of cases these novel expansions were 
      shorter than those previously reported.
