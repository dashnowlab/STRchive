AB  - BACKGROUND: Periodontitis is a chronic infectious disease of periodontal support 
      tissue caused by microorganisms in dental plaque, which causes alveolar bone 
      resorption and tooth loss. Periodontitis treatment goals include prevention of 
      alveolar bone resorption and promotion of periodontal regeneration. We previously 
      found that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was involved in 
      periodontitis-related alveolar bone resorption through induction of an immune 
      response and subsequent destruction of periodontal tissue. However, the 
      mechanisms underlying the effects of G-CSF on abnormal bone remodeling have not 
      yet been fully elucidated. Human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs) are 
      major modulators of osteogenic differentiation in periodontal tissues. Thus, the 
      aim of this study was to investigated whether G-CSF acts effects on hPDLSC 
      proliferation and osteogenic differentiation, as well as periodontal tissue 
      repair. METHODS: hPDLSCs were cultured and identified by short tandem repeat 
      analysis. The expression patterns and locations of G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR) on 
      hPDLSCs were detected by immunofluorescence analysis. The effects of G-CSF on 
      hPDLSCs in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory microenvironment were 
      investigated. Specifically, Cell-Counting Kit 8 (CCK8) and Alizarin red staining 
      were used to examine hPDLSC proliferation and osteogenic differentiation; reverse 
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect the expression 
      patterns of osteogenesis-related genes (alkaline phosphatase [ALP], runt-related 
      transcription factor 2 [Runx2], and osteocalcin [OCN]) in hPDLSCs; and Western 
      blotting was used to detect the expression patterns of phosphatidylinositol 
      3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (Akt) of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. 
      RESULTS: hPDLSCs exhibited a typical spindle-shaped morphology and good 
      clonogenic ability. G-CSFR was mostly localized on the cell surface membrane. 
      Analyses showed that G-CSF inhibited hPDLSC proliferation. Also, in the 
      LPS-induced inflammatory microenvironment, G-CSF inhibited hPDLSC osteogenic 
      differentiation and reduced the expression levels of osteogenesis-related genes. 
      G-CSF increased the protein expression levels of hPDLSC pathway components p-PI3K 
      and p-Akt. CONCLUSIONS: We found that G-CSFR was expressed on hPDLSCs. 
      Furthermore, G-CSF inhibited hPDLSC osteogenic differentiation in vitro in the 
      LPS-induced inflammatory microenvironment.

AB  - Expansions of amino acid repeats occur in >20 inherited human disorders, and many 
      occur in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of transcription factors (TFs). 
      Such diseases are associated with protein aggregation, but the contribution of 
      aggregates to pathology has been controversial. Here, we report that alanine 
      repeat expansions in the HOXD13 TF, which cause hereditary synpolydactyly in 
      humans, alter its phase separation capacity and its capacity to co-condense with 
      transcriptional co-activators. HOXD13 repeat expansions perturb the composition 
      of HOXD13-containing condensates in vitro and in vivo and alter the 
      transcriptional program in a cell-specific manner in a mouse model of 
      synpolydactyly. Disease-associated repeat expansions in other TFs (HOXA13, RUNX2, 
      and TBP) were similarly found to alter their phase separation. These results 
      suggest that unblending of transcriptional condensates may underlie human 
      pathologies. We present a molecular classification of TF IDRs, which provides a 
      framework to dissect TF function in diseases associated with transcriptional 
      dysregulation.

TI  - Runx2 contributes to murine Col10a1 gene regulation through direct interaction 
      with its cis-enhancer.
PG  - 2899-910
LID - 10.1002/jbmr.504 [doi]
AB  - We have recently shown that a 150-bp Col10a1 distal promoter (-4296 to -4147 bp) 
      is sufficient to direct hypertrophic chondrocyte-specific reporter (LacZ) 
      expression in vivo. More recently, through detailed sequence analysis we 
      identified two putative tandem-repeat Runx2 binding sites within the 3'-end of 
      this 150-bp region (TGTGGG-TGTGGC, -4187 to -4176 bp). Candidate electrophoretic 
      mobility shift assay (EMSA), chromatin immunoprecipitation, and transfection 
      studies demonstrate that these putative Runx2 sites bind Runx2 and mediate 
      upregulated Col10a1/reporter activity in vitro. Transgenic studies using the 
      5'-sequence without Runx2 sites were not able to drive the cell-specific LacZ 
      reporter activity, suggesting the in vivo requirement of the Runx2 sites located 
      in the 3'-end in mediating Col10a1/reporter expression. Indeed, mutating the 
      Runx2 sites in the context of the 150-bp promoter abolishes its capacity to drive 
      hypertrophic chondrocyte-specific reporter expression in transgenic mice. We have 
      also generated multiple transgenic mouse lines using only the 3'-sequence 
      containing the Runx2 sites to drive the LacZ gene. Interestingly, no hypertrophic 
      chondrocyte-specific blue staining was observed in these transgenic mice. 
      Together, our data support that Runx2 directly interacts with murine Col10a1 
      cis-enhancer. This interaction is required but not sufficient for cell-specific 
      Col10a1 promoter activity in vivo. Additional cooperative/repressive elements 
      within the 5'- or 3'-sequences of this 150-bp promoter are needed to work with 
      Runx2 together to mediate cell-specific Col10a1 expression. Further delineation 
      of these elements/factors has the potential to identify novel therapeutic targets 
      for multiple skeletal disorders, including osteoarthritis, that show abnormal 
      Col10a1 expression and altered chondrocyte maturation.
