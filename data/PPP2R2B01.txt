AB  - BACKGROUND: Essential tremor (ET) is a neurological disease characterized by 
      action tremor in upper arms. Although its high heritability and prevalence 
      worldwide, its etiology and association with other diseases are still unknown. 
      METHOD: We investigated 10 common spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), including SCA1, 
      SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, SCA17, SCA36, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA) in 92 early-onset familial ET pedigrees in China collected from 
      2016 to 2022. RESULT: We found one SCA12 proband carried 51 CAG repeats within 
      PPP2R2B gene and one SCA3 proband with intermediate CAG repeats (55) with ATXN3 
      gene. The other 90 ET probands all had normal repeat expansions. CONCLUSION: 
      Tremor can be the initial phenotype of certain SCA. For early-onset, familial ET 
      patients, careful physical examinations are needed before genetic SCA screening.

AB  - Neurologists have a difficult time identifying sporadic cerebellar ataxia. 
      Multiple system atrophy of the cerebellar type (MSA-C), spontaneous late cortical 
      cerebellar atrophy, and prolonged alcohol use are a few possible causes. In a 
      group of people with sporadic cerebellar ataxia that was not MSA-C, an 
      autosomal-dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) mutation was recently discovered. 
      Chinese single-hospital cohort will be used in this study to genetic screen for 
      SCA-related genes. One hundred forty individuals with CA were monitored over 8 
      years. Thirty-one individuals had familial CA, 109 patients had sporadic CA, 73 
      had MSA-C, and 36 had non-MSA-C sporadic CA. In 28 of the 31 non-MSA-C sporadic 
      patients who requested the test, we carried out gene analysis, including SCA1, 
      SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, SCA17, SCA31, and 
      dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). The control group consisted of 
      family members of the patients. In 57% of the instances with spontaneous CA that 
      were not MSA-C, gene abnormalities were discovered. The most frequent exception 
      among individuals with sporadic CA was SCA6 (36%), followed by monsters in SCA1, 
      2, 3, 8, and DRPLA. In contrast, 75% of the patients with familial CA had gene 
      abnormalities, the most frequent of which was SCA6 abnormality. The age of 69 vs 
      59 was higher, and the CAG repeat length was a minor age of 23 vs 25 in the 
      former instances compared to the last one among individuals with SCA6 anomalies 
      that were sporadic as opposed to familial cases. In sporadic CA, 
      autosomal-dominant mutations in SCA genes, notably in SCA6, are common. Although 
      the cause of the increased incidence of SCA6 mutations is unknown, it may be 
      related to a greater age of onset and varied penetrance of SCA6 mutations.

TI  - Copy Number Variant Analysis of Spinocerebellar Ataxia Genes in a Cohort of Dutch 
      Patients With Cerebellar Ataxia.
PG  - e200050
LID - 10.1212/NXG.0000000000200050 [doi]
LID - e200050
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a genetically 
      heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders generally caused by single 
      nucleotide variants (SNVs) or indels in coding regions or by repeat expansions in 
      coding and noncoding regions of SCA genes. Copy number variants (CNVs) have now 
      also been reported for 3 genes-ITPR1, FGF14, and SPTBN2-but not all SCA genes 
      have been screened for CNVs as the underlying cause of the disease in patients. 
      In this study, we aim to assess the prevalence of CNVs encompassing 36 known SCA 
      genes. METHODS: A cohort of patients with cerebellar ataxia who were referred to 
      the University Medical Center Groningen for SCA genetic diagnostics was selected 
      for this study. Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping was 
      performed using the Infinium Global Screening Array. Following data processing, 
      genotyping data were uploaded into NxClinical software to perform CNV analysis 
      per patient and to visualize identified CNVs in 36 genes with allocated SCA 
      symbols. The clinical relevance of detected CNVs was determined using evidence 
      from studies based on PubMed literature searches for similar CNVs and phenotypic 
      features. RESULTS: Of the 338 patients with cerebellar ataxia, we identified 
      putative clinically relevant CNV deletions in 3 patients: an identical deletion 
      encompassing ITPR1 in 2 patients, who turned out to be related, and a deletion 
      involving PPP2R2B in another patient. Although the CNV deletion in ITPR1 was 
      clearly the underlying cause of SCA15 in the 2 related patients, the clinical 
      significance of the deletion in PPP2R2B remained unknown. DISCUSSION: We showed 
      that CNVs detectable with the limited resolution of SNP array are a very rare 
      cause of SCA. Nevertheless, we suggest adding CNV analysis alongside SNV analysis 
      to SCA gene diagnostics using next-generation sequencing approaches, at least for 
      ITPR1, to improve the genetic diagnostics for patients.

TI  - Investigation of RFC1 tandem nucleotide repeat locus in diverse neurodegenerative

AB  - An intronic bi-allelic pentanucleotide repeat expansion mutation, 
      (AAGGG)(400-2000), at AAAAG repeat locus in RFC1 gene, is known as underlying 
      genetic cause in cases with cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular 
      areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) and late-onset sporadic ataxia. Biallelic positive 
      cases carry a common recessive risk haplotype, "AAGA," spanning RFC1 gene. In 
      this study, our aim is to find prevalence of bi-allelic (AAGGG)(exp) in Indian 
      ataxia and other neurological disorders and investigate the complexity of RFC1 
      repeat locus and its potential association with neurodegenerative diseases in 
      Indian population-based cohorts. We carried out repeat number and repeat type 
      estimation using flanking PCR and repeat primed PCR (AAAAG/AAAGG/AAGGG) in four 
      Indian disease cohorts and healthy controls. Haplotype assessment of suspected 
      cases was done by genotyping and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Blood samples 
      and consent of all the cases and detailed clinical details of positive cases were 
      collected in collaboration with A.I.I.M.S. Furthermore, comprehension of RFC1 
      repeat locus and risk haplotype analysis in Indian background was performed on 
      the NGS data of Indian healthy controls by ExpansionHunter, ExpansionHunter 
      Denovo, and PHASE analysis, respectively. Genetic screening of RFC1-TNR locus in 
      1998 uncharacterized cases (SCA12: 87; uncharacterized ataxia: 1818, CMT: 93) and 
      564 heterogenous controls showed that the frequency of subjects with bi-allelic 
      (AAGGG)(exp) are 1.15%, < 0.05%, 2.15%, and 0% respectively. Two RFC1 positive 
      sporadic late-onset ataxia cases, one bi-allelic (AAGGG)(exp) and another, 
      (AAAGG)(~700)/(AAGGG)(exp), had recessive risk haplotype and CANVAS symptoms. 
      Long normal alleles, 15-27, are significantly rare in ataxia cohort. In IndiGen 
      control population (IndiGen; N = 1029), long normal repeat range, 15-27, is 
      significantly associated with A(3)G(3) and some rare repeat motifs, AGAGG, AACGG, 
      AAGAG, and AAGGC. Risk-associated "AAGA" haplotype of the original pathogenic 
      expansion of A(2)G(3) was found associated with the A(3)G(3) representing alleles 
      in background population. Apart from bi-allelic (AAGGG)(exp), we report cases 
      with a new pathogenic expansion of (AAAGG)(exp)/(AAGGG)(exp) in RFC1 and 
      recessive risk haplotype. We found different repeat motifs at RFC1 TNR locus, 
      like AAAAG, AAAGG, AAAGGG, AAAAGG, AAGAG, AACGG, AAGGC, AGAGG, and AAGGG, in 
      Indian background population except ACAGG and (AAAGG)(n)/(AAGGG)(n). Our findings 
      will help in further understanding the role of long normal repeat size and 
      different repeat motifs, specifically AAAGG, AAAGGG, and other rare repeat 
      motifs, at the RFC1 locus.

AB  - Tandem repeats (TRs) are one of the largest sources of polymorphism, and their 
      length is associated with gene regulation. Although previous studies reported 
      several tandem repeats regulating gene splicing in cis (spl-TRs), no large-scale 
      study has been conducted. In this study, we established a genome-wide catalog of 
      9537 spl-TRs with a total of 58,290 significant TR-splicing associations across 
      49 tissues (false discovery rate 5%) by using Genotype-Tissue expression (GTex) 
      Project data. Regression models explaining splicing variation by using spl-TRs 
      and other flanking variants suggest that at least some of the spl-TRs directly 
      modulate splicing. In our catalog, two spl-TRs are known loci for repeat 
      expansion diseases, spinocerebellar ataxia 6 (SCA6) and 12 (SCA12). Splicing 
      alterations by these spl-TRs were compatible with those observed in SCA6 and 
      SCA12. Thus, our comprehensive spl-TR catalog may help elucidate the 
      pathomechanism of genetic diseases.

AB  - Cerebellar ataxias (CAs) represent a group of autosomal dominant and recessive 
      neurodegenerative disorders affecting cerebellum with or without spinal cord. 
      Overall, CAs have preponderance for tandem nucleotide repeat expansions as an 
      etiological factor (10 TREs explain nearly 30-40% of ataxia cohort globally). The 
      experience of 10 years of common genetic ataxia subtypes for  approximately 5600 patients' 
      referrals (Pan-India) received at a single center is shared herein. Frequencies 
      (in %, n) of SCA types and FRDA in the sample cohort are observed as follows: 
      SCA12 (8.6%, 490); SCA2 (8.5%, 482); SCA1 (4.8%, 272); SCA3 (2%, 113); SCA7 
      (0.5%, 28); SCA6 (0.1%, 05); SCA17 (0.1%, 05), and FRDA (2.2%, 127). A 
      significant amount of variability in TRE lengths at each locus is observed, we 
      noted presence of biallelic expansion, co-occurrence of SCA-subtypes, and the 
      presence of premutable normal alleles. The frequency of mutated GAA-FRDA allele 
      in healthy controls is 1/158 (0.63%), thus an expected FRDA prevalence of 1:100 
      000 persons. The data of this study are relevant not only for clinical decision 
      making but also for guidance in direction of genetic investigations, 
      transancestral comparison of genotypes, and lastly provide insight for policy 
      decision for the consideration of SCAs under rare disease category.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic efficacy of clinical 
      exome-targeted sequencing (CES) and spinocerebellar ataxia 36 (SCA36) screening 
      in a real-life cohort of patients with cerebellar ataxia (CA) from Eastern Spain. 
      METHODS: A total of 130 unrelated patients with CA, negative for common 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, 
      SCA17, dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy [DRPLA], and Friedreich ataxia), were 
      studied with CES. Bioinformatic and genotype-phenotype analyses were performed to 
      assess the pathogenicity of the variants encountered. Copy number variants were 
      analyzed when appropriate. In undiagnosed dominant and sporadic cases, repeat 
      primed PCR was used to screen for the presence of a repeat expansion in the NOP56 
      gene. RESULTS: CES identified pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 50 
      families (39%), including 23 novel variants. Overall, there was a high genetic 
      heterogeneity, and the most frequent genetic diagnosis was SPG7 (n = 15), 
      followed by SETX (n = 6), CACNA1A (n = 5), POLR3A (n = 4), and SYNE1 (n = 3). In 
      addition, 17 families displayed likely pathogenic/pathogenic variants in 14 
      different genes: KCND3 (n = 2), KIF1C (n = 2), CYP27A1A (n = 2), AFG3L2 (n = 1), 
      ANO10 (n = 1), CAPN1 (n = 1), CWF19L1 (n = 1), ITPR1 (n = 1), KCNA1 (n = 1), OPA1 
      (n = 1), PNPLA6 (n = 1), SPG11 (n = 1), SPTBN2 (n = 1), and TPP1 (n = 1). 
      Twenty-two novel variants were characterized. SCA36 was diagnosed in 11 families, 
      all with autosomal dominant (AD) presentation. SCA36 screening increased the 
      total diagnostic rate to 47% (n = 61/130). Ultimately, undiagnosed patients 
      showed delayed age at onset (p < 0.05) and were more frequently sporadic. 
      DISCUSSION: Our study provides insight into the genetic landscape of CA in 
      Eastern Spain. Although CES was an effective approach to capture genetic 
      heterogeneity, most patients remained undiagnosed. SCA36 was found to be a 
      relatively frequent form and, therefore, should be tested prior to CES in 
      familial AD presentations in particular geographical regions.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 (SCA12) is a neurodegenerative genetic disorder 
      triggered by abnormal CAG repeat expansion at locus 5q32. MRI recognises 
      dissimilarities in affected areas of SCA12 patients and healthy subjects. But 
      manual diagnosis is time-consuming and prone to subjective errors. This has 
      motivated us in developing a systematic and authentic decision model for 
      computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of SCA12. Four different feature extraction 
      techniques are examined in this research work, such as First Order Statistics, 
      GLRLM, GLCM, and GLGCM, to obtain distinguishable characteristics for 
      differentiating SCA12 patients from healthy subjects. The model's performance is 
      measured using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and F1-score with leave-one-out 
      cross-validation scheme. Our experimental results show that features based on the 
      GLRLM can distinguish SCA12 from healthy subjects with a maximum classification 
      accuracy of 85% among all the different function extraction techniques used.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Spinocerebellar ataxia type-12 (SCA12) is a rare form of SCA, most 
      commonly reported from the Indian Agarwal and related families. In this study we 
      describe the clinical, genetic, and radiological characteristics of a sizeable 
      cohort of genetically proven SCA12. METHODS: A retrospective chart-review of the 
      genetically confirmed SCA12 patients from our centre. The demographic, clinical, 
      and investigation findings were reviewed. Correlation of expanded repeats length 
      with various demographic and clinical features were studied. RESULTS: A total of 
      49 patients (34 males, 42 families) were included of which 79.6% belonged to 
      Agarwal community. The mean age at onset and age at presentation were 46.38 +/- 
      11.7 years and 53.16 +/- 12.78 years respectively. The most common initial symptom 
      was tremor (73.5%), followed by ataxia (18.4%). At presentation, 95.9% of the 
      patients had tremor with predominant distribution in the bilateral upper limbs 
      (85.7%). At presentation, 73.5% of patients had ataxia and 22.4% had cognitive 
      dysfunction. The mean CAG repeat length in PPP2R2B in the expanded allele was 
      53.26 +/- 6.10 (40-72). The lowest pathogenic expanded repeat sizes in PPP2R2B 
      recorded in our cohort was 40 & 42 repeats from two patients with a consistent 
      clinical phenotype. Another unusual phenotype was the presence of prominent 
      myoclonus. There was no significant correlation between the age at onset of 
      symptoms and the repeat size of CAG repeat. CONCLUSION: SCA12 is not confined to 
      a single ethnicity. Upper limb tremor and ataxia were the most common 
      presentation. Unusual presentation may cause diagnostic confusion especially when 
      recorded in patients from non-Aggarwal families.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hereditary ataxias demonstrate a high degree of clinical and 
      genetic heterogeneity. Understanding the genetic etiology of hereditary ataxias 
      is crucial for genetic counseling and clinical management. METHODS: The clinical 
      and genetic data of patients with familial or sporadic ataxias who referred to 
      our tertiary medical center were retrospectively analyzed. Probands in this study 
      underwent SCA repeat expansion panel firstly to screen for repeat expansion SCAs; 
      those with negative results had NGS-targeted panels or WES testing to detect 
      conventional mutations. RESULTS: A total of 223 patients were enrolled from 206 
      families. 5 kinds of coexisting SCA repeat expansions were observed (SCA3/SCA17, 
      SCA3/SCA8, SCA2/SCA8, SCA3/SCA12 and SCA8/SCA12) in 12 patients from 8 families, 
      among which SCA2/SCA8, SCA8/SCA12 and SCA3/SCA12 were reported for the first 
      time. The coexistence of expanded SCA3 with SCA17 alleles was the most common in 
      our study. NGS identified pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in 12 ataxia 
      causative genes in 13 probands. Spastic paraplegia ataxia was the most common 
      diagnosis. Six novel mutations were detected in five ataxia-related genes. 
      CONCLUSION: Coexistence may not specific to a certain SCA subtype and the 
      frequency might have been underestimated before. SCA repeat expansion panel 
      should be considered in patients with overlapping SCA features. In addition, our 
      study broadened the conventional mutation spectrum in ataxia-related genes. These 
      results facilitate a better understanding of the genetic basis for hereditary 
      ataxias.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cognitive impairment has now been recognised to be present in 
      patients with several of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). Cognitive impairment in 
      patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 has not been evaluated. OBJECTIVE: 
      To evaluate the cognitive impairment in patients diagnosed with spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 12 (SCA12). METHODS: We conducted a cross sectional study and 
      enrolled 30 (20 male and 10 female) genetically confirmed SCA12 patients and 30 
      healthy, age, gender and education matched individuals as controls. Cognitive 
      domains were tested using a battery of validated neurocognitive tests. RESULT: 
      Mean age of patients was 51.6 +/- 8.0 years and mean disease duration was 5.3 +/- 3.0 
      years. Mean International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) score was 
      29.8 +/- 12.5. SCA 12 patients scored significantly lower than controls in 
      executive function and new learning ability. Other tested cognitive domains were 
      also affected but did not reach statistical significance. Age, age at onset, 
      severity of ataxia, disease duration and CAG repeat length did not correlate with 
      cognitive impairment. CONCLUSION: Cognitive impairment is a part of the spectrum 
      of SCA12 and is characterized by dysfunction in executive function and new 
      learning ability even early in the course of disease.

AB  - PURPOSE: Investigate single nucleotide variants and short tandem repeats in 39 
      genes related to spinocerebellar ataxia in clinical and pathologically defined 
      cohorts of multiple system atrophy. METHODS: Exome sequencing was conducted in 28 
      clinical multiple system atrophy patients to identify single nucleotide variants 
      in spinocerebellar ataxia-related genes. Novel variants were validated in two 
      independent disease cohorts: 86 clinically diagnosed multiple system atrophy 
      patients and 166 pathological multiple system atrophy cases. Expanded repeat 
      alleles in spinocerebellar ataxia genes were evaluated in 36 clinically diagnosed 
      multiple system atrophy patients, and CAG/CAA repeats in TATA-Box Binding Protein 
      (TBP, causative of SCA17) were screened in 216 clinical and pathological multiple 
      system atrophy patients and 346 controls. RESULTS: No known pathogenic 
      spinocerebellar ataxia single nucleotide variants or pathogenic range expanded 
      repeat alleles of ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, AXTN7, ATXN8OS, ATXN10, PPP2R2B, 
      and TBP were detected in any clinical multiple system atrophy patients. However, 
      four novel variants were identified in four spinocerebellar ataxia-related genes 
      across three multiple system atrophy patients. Additionally, four multiple system 
      atrophy patients (1.6%) and one control (0.3%) carried an intermediate length 41 
      TBP CAG/CAA repeat allele (OR = 4.11, P = 0.21). There was a significant 
      association between the occurrence of a repeat length of longer alleles (> 38 
      repeats) and an increased risk of multiple system atrophy (OR = 1.64, P = 0.03). 
      CONCLUSION: Occurrence of TBP CAG/CAA repeat length of longer alleles (> 38 
      repeats) is significantly associated with increased multiple system atrophy risk. 
      This discovery warrants further investigation and supports a possible genetic 
      overlap of multiple system atrophy with SCA17.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The diagnostic workup for choreiform movement disorders including 
      Huntington's disease (HD) and those mimicking HD like phenotype is complex. 
      OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to genetically define HD and HD-like 
      presentations in an Indian cohort. We also describe HTT-CAG expansion manifesting 
      as neuroferritinopathy-like disorder in four families from Punjab in India. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: 159 patients clinically diagnosed as HD and HD-like 
      presentations from various tertiary neurology clinics were referred to our centre 
      (CSIR-IGIB) for genetic investigations. As a first tier test, CAG-TNR for HTT was 
      performed and subsequently HD-negative samples were screened for JPH3 (HDL2), TBP 
      (SCA17), ATN1 (DRPLA), PPP2R2B (SCA12) and GGGGCC expansion in C9orf72 gene. Four 
      families presenting as neuroferritinopathy-like disorder were also investigated 
      for HTT-CAG expansion. RESULTS: 94 of 159 (59%) patients were found to have 
      expanded HTT-CAG repeats. Pathogenic repeat expansion in JPH3, TBP, ATN1 and 
      C9orf72 were not found in HD negative cases. Two patients were positive for 
      SCA12-CAG expansion in pathogenic length, whereas 5 cases harboured TBP-CAG 
      repeats falling in reduced penetrance range of 41- 48 repeats for SCA17. Four 
      unrelated families, presented with atypical chorea and brain MRI findings 
      suggestive of basal ganglia abnormalities mimicking neuroferritinopathy were 
      found to harbour HTT-CAG expansion. CONCLUSION: We present SCA12 as a new 
      reported phenocopy of HD which should be considered for diagnostic workout along 
      with SCA17 for HD-like syndromes. This study also illustrates the necessity, to 
      consider evolving HD like phenotype, as a clinical diagnosis for cases with 
      initial manifestations depicting neuroferritinopathy.

TI  - Live births following preimplantation genetic testing for dynamic mutation 
      diseases by karyomapping: a report of three cases.
PG  - 539-548
LID - 10.1007/s10815-020-01718-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic defects (PGT-M) is a 
      beneficial strategy for the patients suffering from a Mendelian disease, which 
      could protect their offspring from inheriting the disease. The purpose of this 
      study is to report the effectiveness of PGT-M based on karyomapping for three 
      cases of dynamic mutation diseases with trinucleotide repeat expansion. METHODS: 
      PGT-M was carried out on three couples, whose family members were diagnosed with 
      Huntington's disease or spinocerebellar ataxias 2 or 12. The whole genome 
      amplification was obtained using the multiple displacement amplification (MDA) 
      method. Then, karyomapping was performed to detect the allele that is carrying 
      the trinucleotide repeat expansion using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 
      linkage analyses, and the copy number variations (CNVs) of the embryos were also 
      identified. Prenatal diagnosis was performed to validate the accuracy of PGT-M. 
      RESULTS: PGT-M was successfully performed on the three couples, and they accepted 
      the transfers of euploid blastocysts without the relevant pathogenic allele. The 
      clinical pregnancies were acquired and the prenatal diagnosis of the three 
      families confirmed the effectiveness of karyomapping. The three born babies were 
      healthy and free of the pathogenic alleles HTT, ATXN2, or PPP2R2B corresponding 
      to Huntington's disease, spinocerebellar ataxias 2 or 12, respectively. 
      CONCLUSION: This study shows that karyomapping is a highly powerful and efficient 
      approach for dynamic mutation detection in preimplantation embryos. In this work, 
      we first report the birth of healthy babies that are free of the pathogenic gene 
      for dynamic mutation diseases in patients receiving PGT-M by karyomapping.

      BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 (SCA12) is a rare form of an 
      autosomal-dominant ataxic disorder associated with an expansion of CAG repeat 
      length. Here, we present a large case series of patients with SCA12 and describe 
      a wide range of typical and rare symptoms. METHODS: Twenty-one consecutive 
      patients with genetically proven SCA12 underwent detailed neurological 
      examination. We assessed clinical characteristics using validated rating scales 
      for evaluating motor features in SCA. Nonmotor symptoms and quality of life were 
      assessed using appropriate, validated scales. Correlations of CAG repeat length 
      with both severity score and age of onset were explored. RESULTS: The mean age of 
      onset was 51 years, and most patients were descendants of a single, endogamous 
      Indian community (Agarwal). Tremor was the most common initial presenting symptom 
      (90%). Hand dystonia was present in 14 of 21 patients, and most patients in the 
      cohort presented with gait disturbance. Neuropsychiatric manifestations were 
      common coexisting features. The CAG repeat length was significantly correlated (r 
      = -0.760; P = 0.0001) with early age of onset, but not with disease severity. 
      Tremor affected the quality of life in 18 of 21 patients, because they had 
      difficulty in handling liquids. CONCLUSIONS: Tremor was the most common, 
      nonataxic symptom at initial presentation in patients with SCA12. Proximal upper 
      limb tremor, typically with high amplitude and low frequency, can raise a strong 
      diagnostic suspicion. Associated hand dystonia was a common coexisting motor 
      feature. Various nonmotor features were also observed in several cases which 
      require therapeutic attention.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type-12 (SCA12) is a neurological disorder caused due to 
      triplet (CAG) repeat expansion in 5' UTR of PPP2R2B. It is one of the most 
      prominent SCA-subtype in Indian population and till date no patient specific 
      models have been described. Human-induced-pluripotent-stem cell (HiPSC) based 
      disease modelling has become the next generation tool for studying various human 
      pathologies. In the present study we established three SCA12 patient specific 
      iPSC lines. All the generated lines have shown pluripotency markers, normal 
      karyotype, in-vitro three germ layers differentiation potential, vector 
      clearance, SCA12 mutation, parental genomic identity and contamination free 
      culture.

TI  - Genetic testing for clinically suspected spinocerebellar ataxias: report from a 
      tertiary referral centre in India.
PG  - 219-224
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      syndromes, characterized by a wide range of muscular weakness and motor deficits, 
      caused due to cerebellar degeneration. The prevalence of the syndromes of SCA 
      varies across the world and is known to be linked to the instability of 
      trinucleotide repeats within the high-end normal alleles, along with susceptible 
      haplotype. We estimated sizes of the CAG or GAA repeat expansions at the SCA1, 
      SCA2, SCA3, SCA12 and frataxin loci among 864 referrals of subjects to genetic 
      counselling and testing (GCAT) clinic, National Institute of Mental Health and 
      Neurosciences, Bengaluru, India, with suspected SCA. The most frequent mutations 
      detected were SCA1 (n = 100 (11.6%)) and SCA2 (n = 98 (11.3%)) followed by SCA3 
      (n = 40 (4.6%)), FRDA (n = 20 (2.3%)) and SCA12 (n = 8 (0.9%)).

      SCA patients negative for the most common SCA subtypes.
PG  - 3

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) subtypes are often caused by expansions 
      in non-coding regions of genes like SCA8, SCA10, SCA12 and SCA36. Other ataxias 
      are known to be associated with repeat expansions such as fragile X-associated 
      tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) or expansions in the C9orf72 gene. When no 
      mutation has been identified in the aforementioned genes next-generation 
      sequencing (NGS)-based diagnostics may also be applied. In order to define an 
      optimal diagnostic strategy, more information about the frequency and phenotypic 
      characteristics of rare repeat expansion disorders associated with ataxia should 
      be at hand. METHODS: We analyzed a consecutive cohort of 440 German unrelated 
      patients with symptoms of cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria and other unspecific 
      symptoms who were referred to our center for SCA diagnostics. They showed alleles 
      in the normal range for the most common SCA subtypes SCA1-3, SCA6, SCA7 and 
      SCA17. These patients were screened for expansions causing SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, 
      SCA36 and FXTAS as well as for the pathogenic hexanucleotide repeat in the 
      C9orf72 gene. RESULTS: Expanded repeats for SCA10, SCA12 or SCA36 were not 
      identified in the analyzed patients. Five patients showed expanded SCA8 CTA/CTG 
      alleles with 92-129 repeats. One 51-year-old male with unclear dementia symptoms 
      was diagnosed with a large GGGGCC repeat expansion in C9orf72. The analysis of 
      the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1) revealed one patient with a 
      premutation (>50 CGG repeats) and seven patients with alleles in the grey zone 
      (41 to 54 CGG repeats). CONCLUSIONS: Altogether five patients showed 92 or more 
      SCA8 CTA/CTG combined repeats. Our results support the assumption that smaller 
      FMR1 gene expansions could be associated with the risk of developing neurological 
      signs. The results do not support genetic testing for C9orf72 expansion in ataxia 
      patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Postural tremor can sometimes occur in spinocerebellar ataxias 
      (SCAs). However, the prevalence and clinical characteristics of postural tremor 
      in SCAs are poorly understood, and whether SCA patients with postural tremor have 
      different ataxia progression is not known. METHODS: We studied postural tremor in 
      315 patients with SCA1, 2, 3, and 6 recruited from the Clinical Research 
      Consortium for Spinocerebellar Ataxias (CRC-SCA), which consists of 12 
      participating centers in the United States, and we evaluated ataxia progression 
      in these patients from January 2010 to August 2012. RESULTS: Among 315 SCA 
      patients, postural tremor was most common in SCA2 patients (SCA1, 5.8%; SCA2, 
      27.5%; SCA3, 12.4%; SCA6, 16.9%; p = 0.007). SCA3 patients with postural tremor 
      had longer CAG repeat expansions than SCA3 patients without postural tremor 
      (73.67 +/- 3.12 vs. 70.42 +/- 3.96, p = 0.003). Interestingly, SCA1 and SCA6 patients 
      with postural tremor had a slower rate of ataxia progression (SCA1, beta = -0.91, p 
      < 0.001; SCA6, beta = -1.28, p = 0.025), while SCA2 patients with postural tremor 
      had a faster rate of ataxia progression (beta = 1.54, p = 0.034). We also found that 
      the presence of postural tremor in SCA2 patients could be influenced by repeat 
      expansions of ATXN1 (beta = -1.53, p = 0.037) and ATXN3 (beta = 0.57, p = 0.018), 
      whereas postural tremor in SCA3 was associated with repeat lengths in TBP (beta = 
      0.63, p = 0.041) and PPP2R2B (beta = -0.40, p = 0.032). DISCUSSION: Postural tremor 
      could be a clinical feature of SCAs, and the presence of postural tremor could be 
      associated with different rates of ataxia progression. Genetic interactions 
      between ataxia genes might influence the brain circuitry and thus affect the 
      clinical presentation of postural tremor.

TI  - Compound heterozygous intermediate MJD alleles cause cerebellar ataxia with 
      sensory neuropathy.
PG  - e123
LID - e123
AB  - Spinocerebellar degeneration (SCD) is a group of disorders characterized by 
      progressive ataxia caused by dysfunction and atrophy of the cerebellum or its 
      projections. Approximately one-third of SCD cases are familial SCD, the majority 
      of which are attributed to CAG triplet repeat expansions including 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)1, SCA2, Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)/SCA3, SCA6, 
      SCA8, SCA12, SCA17, and dentate-rubro-pallido-luysian atrophy (DRPLA). The 
      triplet repeat number of the alleles representing complete penetrance varies 
      among diseases. Generally, there is a gap between the normal alleles and the 
      complete penetrance alleles. Rarely, intermediate alleles with the repeat numbers 
      between the abnormal and normal ranges are observed, although the implications of 
      these intermediate alleles remain ambiguous.

TI  - Clinical behaviour of spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 and intermediate length 
      abnormal CAG repeats in PPP2R2B.
PG  - 27-36
LID - 10.1093/brain/aww269 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 (SCA12) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by CAG repeat expansion in the PPP2R2B gene. Previously, the causal length 
      of CAG repeats ascribed to SCA12 was more than 51; however, a few reports have 
      also described unusual occurrence of CAG repeat length 36-51 repeats among 
      patients of different geographical population, with atypical clinical 
      association. From our systematic search for SCA12 in a genetic screening 
      programme, we have identified a large number of SCA12 cases. In this study, we 
      specifically describe the clinical behaviour of 18 patients who harbour CAG 
      repeats in the range of 43-50 and compare their clinical behaviour with patients 
      carrying typical pathogenic threshold length of 51 CAG repeats. Unsurprisingly, 
      we observed that the clinical characteristics were similar to those of typical 
      SCA12 phenotype, with large variability in the age at onset. Radiologically, we 
      observed a variable degree of cerebro-cerebellar degeneration along with white 
      matter changes that do not correlate with the disease severity. We define a new 
      pathogenic threshold of CAG-43 to be pathogenic for SCA12 diagnosis and also 
      describe the clinical profiles of two biallelic CAG expansion carriers. We also 
      propose that SCA12 might not be that restricted in terms of occurrence in other 
      geographical or ethnic populations, as it was previously presumed to be.

AB  - BACKGROUND: About 50 % of Thai patients with adult-onset spinocerebellar ataxia 
      (SCA) was Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), SCA1, SCA2 and SCA6. The author 
      investigated further on less common SCAs in the patients without any known 
      mutations. METHODS: DNA samples of 82 index patients who were genetically 
      excluded MJD, SCA1, SCA2, SCA6, SCA7 and dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy 
      (DRPLA) were examined. Analysis of SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, SCA17 and SCA19 genes were 
      comprehensively performed. Normal range of trinucleotide repeat expansion sizes 
      of TATA-box-binding protein gene (TBP) were also determined in 374 control 
      subjects. RESULTS: Eight patients carried >/=42 CAG/CAA repeat allele in the TBP 
      consistent with SCA17. The pathological repeat alleles ranged from 42 to 57 
      repeats. All patients had significant degree of cognitive dysfunction. Other 
      non-ataxic phenotypes comprised of parkinsonism, chorea, dystonia and myoclonus. 
      A sporadic patient carried a heterozygous 41-repeat allele developed chronic 
      progressive cerebellar degeneration commenced at the age of 28 years. Whilst, 2 % 
      of the control subjects (8/374) carried the 41-repeat allele. Five of the 
      carriers were re-examined, and revealed that four of them had parkinsonism and/or 
      cognitive impairment without cerebellar signs. Analysis of other types of SCAs 
      was all negative. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study of SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, 
      SCA17 and SCA19 in Thais. SCA17 appears to be an important cause of ataxia in 
      Thailand. Although, the pathological cut-off point of the TBP repeat allele 
      remains unclear, the finding suggests that the 41-repeat may be a pathological 
      allele resulting late-onset or mild phenotype. Apart from ataxia, cognitive 
      impairment and parkinsonism may be clinical presentations in these carriers.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: SCA12 is a progressive autosomal-dominant disorder, caused by a 
      CAG/CTG repeat expansion in PPP2R2B on chromosome 5q32, and characterized by 
      tremor, gait ataxia, hyperreflexia, dysmetria, abnormal eye movements, anxiety, 
      depression, and sometimes cognitive impairment. Neuroimaging has demonstrated 
      cerebellar and cortical atrophy. We now present the neuropathology of the first 
      autopsied SCA12 brain and utilize cell models to characterize potential 
      mechanisms of SCA12 neurodegeneration. METHODS: A fixed SCA12 brain was examined 
      using gross, microscopic, and immunohistochemical methods. The effect of the 
      repeat expansion on PPP2R2B Bbeta1 expression was examined in multiple cell types by 
      transient transfection of constructs containing the PPP2R2B Bbeta1 promoter region 
      attached to a luciferase reporter. The neurotoxic effect of PPP2R2B 
      overexpression was examined in transfected rat primary neurons. RESULTS: 
      Neuropathological investigation revealed enlarged ventricles, marked cerebral 
      cortical atrophy and Purkinje cell loss, less-prominent cerebellar and pontine 
      atrophy, and neuronal intranuclear ubiquitin-positive inclusions, consistent with 
      Marinesco bodies, which did not stain for long polyglutamine tracts, 
      alpha-synuclein, tau, or transactive response DNA-binding protein 43. Reporter 
      assays demonstrated that the region of PPP2R2B containing the repeat functions as 
      a promoter, and that promoter activity increases with longer repeat length and is 
      dependent on cell type, repeat sequence, and sequence flanking the repeat. 
      Overexpression of PPP2R2B in primary cortical neurons disrupted normal 
      morphology. CONCLUSIONS: SCA12 involves extensive, but selective, 
      neurodegeneration distinct from Alzheimer's disease, synucleinopathies, 
      tauopathies, and glutamine expansion diseases. SCA12 neuropathology may arise 
      from the neurotoxic effect of repeat-expansion-induced overexpression of PPP2R2B.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the association of repeat expansion size in 10 common 
      degenerative hereditary ataxia genes with essential tremor. These genes were 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)-1 (ATXN1), SCA-2 (ATXN2), SCA-3 (ATXN3), SCA-6 
      (CACNA1A), SCA-7 (ATXN7), SCA-8 (ATXN8OS), SCA-10 (ATXN10), SCA-12 (PPP2R2B), 
      SCA-17 (TBP) and dentatorubral-pallidolysian atrophy (DRPLA) (ATN1). METHODS: 
      Genetic analysis of repeat size in 10 degenerative hereditary ataxia loci was 
      performed in 323 essential tremor patients and 299 controls enrolled at Columbia 
      University. To test for differences in the allele distribution between patients 
      and controls, a CLUMP analysis was performed. RESULTS: None of the essential 
      tremor patients had a repeat expansion in the intermediate or pathogenic range. 
      Significant differences in the distribution of repeats in the 'normal' range for 
      SCA2 and SCA8 (both p </= 0.02) were observed between essential tremor patients and 
      controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that pathogenic repeat expansions in 
      SCA loci are not associated with essential tremor.

TI  - Identification of 46 CAG repeats within PPP2R2B as probably the shortest 
      pathogenic allele for SCA12.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 (SCA12) is predominantly characterized 
      by action tremor, followed by slowly progressive cerebellar dysfunction. It is a 
      very rare disorder and only identified in certain countries so far. The current 
      appreciation for phenotypic and genotypic features of SCA12 is still limited. 
      METHODS: We investigated CAG copies within PPP2R2B in 29 patients with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia who are excluded from the most common SCA subtypes 
      including SCA1, SCA2, SCA3 and SCA6. The medical data of patients carrying 
      abnormal expanded PPP2R2B allele were reviewed and summarized. RESULTS: We found 
      that 3 patients carried 53, 46 and 54 CAG repeats respectively, while the other 
      26 cases harbored CAG repeats less than 30. The probably shortest pathogenic 
      allele of 46 repeats was detected in one kindred typically experiencing action 
      tremor. Additionally, compared to the prominent cerebellar ataxia, nystagmus and 
      dysphagia seem to be rare in our SCA12 patients. CONCLUSIONS: SCA12 might not be 
      as rare in Chinese as previously assumed. The identification of the shortest 
      pathogenic allele helps to define the minimal limit implicated in the disease 
      onset. Moreover, the disease manifestations distinct from other SCA subtypes 
      could help clinicians to provide timely genetic counseling.

AB  - In a Chinese family with Spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 (SCA12), presenting with 
      action tremor, mild cerebellar dysfunction, and hyperreflexia, genetic testing 
      revealed abnormal CAG repeat length in the brain-specific protein phosphatase 2, 
      regulatory subunit B, beta isoform (PPP2R2B) gene. To our knowledge, this is the 
      first report on patients with SCA12 presenting with prominent cerebral white 
      matter change besides cerebral and/or cerebellar atrophy.

AB  - Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a clinical and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of debilitating neurodegenerative diseases that are related 
      to at least 36 different genetic loci; they are clinically characterized by 
      progressive cerebellar ataxia and are frequently accompanied by other 
      neurological and non-neurological manifestations. The relative frequency of SCA 
      varies greatly among different regions, presumably because of a founder effect or 
      local ethnicities. Between July 1998 and May 2012, we investigated 320 Brazilian 
      patients with an SCA phenotype who belonged to 150 unrelated families with an 
      autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and 23 sporadic patients from 13 Brazilian 
      states. A total of 265 patients (82.8%) belonging to 131 unrelated families 
      (87.3%) were found to have a definite mutation, and SCA3 accounted for most of 
      the familial cases (70.7%), followed by SCA7 (6%), SCA1 (5.3%), SCA2 (2.7%), SCA6 
      (1.3%), SCA8 (0.7%) and SCA10 (0.7%). In the Ribeirao Preto mesoregion, which is 
      located in the northeast part of Sao Paulo State, the prevalence of SCA3 was 
      approximately 5 per 100,000 inhabitants, which is the highest prevalence found in 
      Brazil. No mutation was found in the SCA12, SCA17 and DRPLA genes, and all the 
      sporadic cases remained without a molecular diagnosis. This study further 
      characterizes the spectrum of SCA mutations found in Brazilian patients, which 
      suggests the existence of regional differences and demonstrates the expansion of 
      the SCA8 locus in Brazilian families.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are autosomal-dominant 
      neurodegenerative diseases that are clinically and genetically heterogeneous. 
      SCAs are characterized by a range of neurological symptoms. SCA12 is an 
      autosomal-dominant (AD) ataxia caused by a CAG repeat expansion mutation in a 
      presumed promoter region of the gene PPP2R2B in a non-coding region on chromosome 
      5q32. This study sought to determine changes in different positions in a single 
      Uyghur SCA12 pedigree by measuring the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and 
      fractional anisotropy (FA). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A single Uyghur pedigree was 
      collected and was confirmed to possess SCA12 by genetic diagnosis, among which 13 
      cases were patients and 54 cases were "healthy" individuals. Five patients were 
      presymptomatic and 15 individuals selected as a control group were examination in 
      the same time. DTI was performed on a 1.5T scanner, with b=1000 s/mm2 and 15 
      directions. ADC and FA were measured by regions of interest positioned in the 
      corticospinal tract at the level of the pons (pons), superior peduncle (SCP), 
      middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), cerebellar cortex (CeC), cerebral cortex (CC), 
      and cerebellar vermis (CV) white matter. RESULTS: Compared with the controls, the 
      ADC was significantly elevated in the CeC, SCP, CC, and CV regions in SCA12 
      patients. The FA significantly decreased in the CC region in SCA12 patients and 
      the CC and CV regions in SCA12 presymptomatic patients. The course of the 
      disease, SARA score, and ADC values in CV showed highly positive correlations. 
      CONCLUSIONS: SCA12 pedigree patients exhibited microstructural damage in the 
      brain white matter. The damage in white matter fiber may first occur in the CC 
      and CV regions in SCA12 presymptomatic patients. The ADC values in the CV region 
      could reflect disease severity in SCA12 patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a clinically 
      heterogeneous disorder characterized predominantly by tremor, followed by late 
      onset gait ataxia, autonomic dysfunction and/or cognitive impairment. We aimed to 
      screen FMR1-CGG repeats in our cohort of progressive late-onset cerebellar 
      ataxia/tremor cohort to characterize the occurrence of FXTAS in India. METHODS: 
      We have screened FMR1-CGG repeats in 109 patients and 173 healthy control 
      subjects. Our cohort comprised: a)group of patients with predominant cerebellar 
      ataxia and/or tremor. b.)suspected cases of MSA and c.)patients who presented 
      SCA12-like neurological manifestations (late onset predominant tremor and/or 
      ataxia). All the cases were ruled out for known triplet-repeat-expansion (TRE) 
      SCA mutations. RESULTS: We have found three FMR1-premutation carriers among the 
      cases. Two of them (with CGG-96 and CGG-102) were under evaluation for their 
      SCA12-like manifestations and another (CGG-78) had progressive gait ataxia. 
      Overall the frequency of FXTAS in our cohort was found to be 3.3% among cases of 
      late onset cerebellar-ataxia/tremor; however, incidences were higher among cases 
      with SCA12-like syndrome (9%, 2/23). CONCLUSION: Finding FXTAS in patients with 
      SCA12-like manifestation suggests that TRE in the 5'UTR of the gene is the common 
      cue connecting two disorders with common phenotype of tremor/ataxia. This 
      knowledge might shed light upon their sharing of molecular neuropathology.

AB  - Intermediate-length polyglutamine expansions in ataxin 2 are a risk factor for 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The polyglutamine tract is encoded by a 
      trinucleotide repeat in a coding region of the ataxin 2 gene (ATXN2). Noncoding 
      nucleotide repeat expansions in several genes are also associated with 
      neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases. For example, hexanucleotide repeat 
      expansions located in a noncoding region of C9ORF72 are the most common cause of 
      ALS. We sought to assess a potential larger role of noncoding nucleotide repeat 
      expansions in ALS. We analyzed the nucleotide repeat lengths of 6 genes (ATXN8, 
      ATXN10, PPP2R2B, NOP56, DMPK, and JPH3) that have previously been associated with 
      neurologic or neuromuscular disorders, in several hundred sporadic patients with 
      ALS and healthy control subjects. We report no association between ALS and repeat 
      length in any of these genes, suggesting that variation in the noncoding 
      repetitive regions in these genes does not contribute to ALS.

AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) encompass a heterogeneous group of 
      rare diseases that affect the cerebellum and its connections. The most common 
      forms have been associated with dynamic mutations while some rarer forms with 
      conventional mutations. Studies in different populations revealed differences in 
      their relative frequencies both within and between the studied populations, 
      showing that the frequencies are depended on ethnic and geographical factors. 
      Previous investigation of triplet repeat expansion SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, 
      SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, SCA17 and DRPLA) in the Cypriot population, revealed no 
      pathogenic expansion in the Cypriot SCA patients. We hereby present our recent 
      investigation of the SCA10 pentanucleotide repeat expansion. Forty-two 
      ascertained Cypriot sporadic ataxia patients, the index case from 1 ADCA and 14 
      ARCA families and a cohort of normal population individuals were included in the 
      study. All our patients have normal range ATXN10 gene ATTCT repeat numbers 
      (10-19). In the normal population group, repeat lengths ranged from 11 to 20 with 
      the 14 repeats allele being the most frequent. Therefore, all currently 
      established dynamic repeat SCA mutations are absent from the Cypriot population, 
      indicating distinct genetic causes.

TI  - Analysis of spinocerebellar ataxias due to expanded triplet repeats in Greek 
      patients with cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 178-80
LID - 10.1016/j.jns.2012.03.019 [doi]
AB  - The relative frequency of different autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias, 
      commonly referred to as spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), varies considerably among 
      populations of different ethnic origin. No data exist at present on the frequency 
      of different SCAs in the Greek population. In the present study we investigated 
      the presence of triplet repeat expansion SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, 
      SCA8, SCA12, SCA17 and DRPLA) in a cohort of 83 Greek patients with slowly 
      progressive cerebellar ataxia. Twenty patients came from autosomal dominant (AD) 
      pedigrees, seven displayed recessive or unclear inheritance and 56 were sporadic. 
      We found four patients with pathological SCA expansions, all from AD pedigrees. 
      Two patients had SCA1, one SCA2 and one SCA7 (10.0, 5.0 and 5.0% of the AD group, 
      respectively). The clinical features of these patients were within the expected 
      spectrum. In total, a pathological expansion was detected in 20% of patients from 
      AD pedigrees. Interestingly, no cases of SCA3 or SCA6 were detected in the AD 
      group. No expansions were found in other familial cases or in sporadic patients. 
      Overall, no cases of SCA3, SCA6, SCA12, SCA17 or DRPLA were identified in the 
      Greek population. In conclusion, SCA1, SCA2 and SCA7 are present in Greek 
      patients with AD cerebellar ataxia in frequencies similar to those observed in 
      other populations. SCA3 and SCA6 appear however to be rare in Greece. The genetic 
      cause for the majority of AD ataxias remains to be identified.

TI  - Genetic screening of Greek patients with Huntington's disease phenocopies 
      identifies an SCA8 expansion.
PG  - 1874-8
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by a 
      triad of chorea, psychiatric disturbance and cognitive decline. Around 1% of 
      patients with HD-like symptoms lack the causative HD expansion and are considered 
      HD phenocopies. Genetic diseases that can present as HD phenocopies include 
      HD-like syndromes such as HDL1, HDL2 and HDL4 (SCA17), some spinocerebellar 
      ataxias (SCAs) and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). In this study we 
      screened a cohort of 21 Greek patients with HD phenocopy syndromes formutations 
      causing HDL2, SCA17, SCA1, SCA2, SCA3,SCA8, SCA12 and DRPLA. Fifteen patients 
      (71%) had a positive family history. We identified one patient (4.8% of the total 
      cohort) with an expansion of 81 combined CTA/CTG repeats at the SCA8 locus. This 
      falls within what is believed to be the high-penetrance allele range. In addition 
      to the classic HD triad, the patient had features of dystonia and oculomotor 
      apraxia. There were no cases of HDL2, SCA17, SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA12 or DRPLA. 
      Given the controversy surrounding the SCA8 expansion, the present finding may be 
      incidental. However, if pathogenic, it broadens the phenotype that may be 
      associated with SCA8 expansions. The absence of any other mutations in our cohort 
      is not surprising, given the low probability of reaching a genetic diagnosis in 
      HD phenocopy patients.

TI  - Detection of large expansions in SCA8 using a fluorescent repeat-primed PCR 
      assay.
PG  - 63-6
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) is a neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterized by slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia. It is caused by 
      bidirectional expression of (CUG)n expansion in the ATXN80S/ATXN8 gene and (CAG)n 
      expansion transcripts in ATXN8. The diagnosis of SCA8 must be confirmed by the 
      presence of a (CTG)n trinucleotide repeat expansion in the ATXN8OS gene. On the 
      other hand, there are many human genetic diseases that are caused by expansion of 
      short tandem repeats. Since Werner et al proposed a repeat-primed fluorescent PCR 
      to detect large CTG-repeats in myotonic dystrophy, Friedreich ataxia, SCA2, SCA7, 
      SCA10 and SCA12 have been reported. In this study, we applied a fluorescent PCR 
      method for detection of expanded repeats in the ATXN8OS/ATXN8 gene. Although this 
      test cannot give a precise estimate of the size of the expansion, it proved 
      useful for confirming the presence of expansions in SCA8.

AB  - DNA triplet repeat expansion-associated ataxias, Friedreich's ataxia, and 
      different types of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are progressive multisystem 
      neurodegenerative disorders. The diagnosis of this wide group of inherited 
      ataxias is essentially based on clinical findings. Cell-free circulating DNA in 
      plasma has been considered as a powerful tool in clinical diagnosis and prognosis 
      of several human diseases. In the present study, clinically suspected patients 
      were assessed on the International Co-operative Ataxia Rating Scale and further 
      confirmed by molecular analysis of DNA triplet repeats. Quantification of plasma 
      DNA using a highly sensitive and DNA-specific PicoGreen fluorescent assay was 
      done. We found significantly high levels (p < 0.001) of plasma DNA of 
      167 +/- 43 ng/mL in Friedreich's ataxia patients (n = 15), 148 +/- 29 ng/mL in SCA2 
      patients (n = 10), and 137 +/- 29 ng/mL in SCA12 patients (n = 25), whereas those 
      of healthy controls (n = 20) was only 59 +/- 15 ng/mL. Therefore, we were able to 
      distinguish between ataxia patients and healthy controls using plasma DNA. 
      Although the precise mechanism by which plasma DNA enters into circulation is not 
      known, significantly higher concentrations of plasma DNA appears to be due to 
      neuronal and muscular degeneration in these patients. Identification of genes in 
      plasma DNA, which are overexpressed or novel, can be a promising tool for the 
      prognosis of these diseases.

AB  - We analyzed the association between PPP2R2B gene CAG repeat length and Alzheimer 
      disease (AD) susceptibility in the Japanese population. Blood samples were 
      collected from 218 late-onset AD patients and 86 controls. DNA fragments 
      containing the target CAG repeat region were amplified using polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR). PCR products were sequenced using ABI PRISM 310 genetic analyzer. 
      The mean CAG repeat length did not differ significantly between the control and 
      AD groups. In contrast, the frequency of CAG repeats shorter than 15 was 
      significantly higher in AD group, specifically in the AD with APOE4 subgroup, 
      than in the control group. The results suggest that CAG repeat lengths in the 
      PPP2R2B gene may be potential genetic markers for AD susceptibility in the 
      Japanese population.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To map the disease locus and to identify a gene mutation in a 
      Japanese family with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia. DESIGN: A genome-wide 
      linkage analysis was performed using the Affymetrix genome-wide human 
      single-nucleotide polymorphism array containing 909 622 single-nucleotide 
      polymorphisms. Direct nucleotide sequencing of a candidate gene was performed. 
      SETTING: Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine and Tokyo University 
      Graduate School of Medicine. Patients  Four affected and 6 healthy individuals in 
      a family with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia. RESULTS: One locus on 
      chromosome 5q had a multipoint logarithm of odds score of 2.408, the theoretical 
      maximum. This locus was flanked by markers rs681591 and rs32582 and includes 
      PPP2R2B (protein phosphatase 2, regulatory subunit B, beta isoform), the 
      causative gene of autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia 12 (SCA12). However, 
      unlike SCA12, no CAG repeat expansions in the promoter region and no nucleotide 
      substitution or insertion-deletion mutations in the exons of the PPP2R2B gene 
      were found. CONCLUSION: Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia mapping to 
      5q31-q33.1 has no CAG repeat expansion or other mutations of the PPP2R2B gene.

AB  - PPP2R2B, a protein widely expressed in neurons, regulates the protein phosphatase 
      2A (PP2A) activity for dephosphorylation of tau and other substrates. CAG repeat 
      expansion at the 5'-end of the PPP2R2B gene causes autosomal dominant 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 12. In the present study, we investigated the roles 
      of CAG repeats and flanking cis elements and the associated proteins in 
      controlling PPP2R2B expression. Deletion/site-directed mutagenesis, in silico 
      searches and cDNA overexpression revealed that CREB1 and SP1 bind to the 
      conserved sequence upstream the CAG repeats to up-regulate PPP2R2B expression, 
      whereas TFAP4 binds to the conserved sequence downstream the CAG repeats to 
      down-regulate PPP2R2B expression. The binding of CREB1, SP1, and TFAP4 to the 
      PPP2R2B promoter was further confirmed by DNA pull-down and ChIP-PCR assays. CAG 
      repeats itself also function as a cis element to up-regulate PPP2R2B expression 
      as AT repeat length has no effect on PPP2R2B expression. Together, our data 
      provide evidence that CREB1, SP1, and TFAP4 play roles in modulating PPP2R2B 
      expression, thus offering a mechanism of regulating PP2A activity as the 
      treatment of neurodegenerative diseases associated with abnormal PP2A activity.

PG  - 36241-8
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M800989200 [doi]
AB  - The neurodegenerative disorder spinocerebellar ataxia 12 (SCA12) is caused by CAG 
      repeat expansion in the non-coding region of the PPP2R2B gene. PPP2R2B encodes 
      Bbeta1 and Bbeta2, alternatively spliced and neuron-specific regulatory subunits 
      of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) holoenzyme. We show here that in PC12 cells 
      and hippocampal neurons, cell stressors induced a rapid translocation of 
      PP2A/Bbeta2 to mitochondria to promote apoptosis. Conversely, silencing of 
      PP2A/Bbeta2 protected hippocampal neurons against free radical-mediated, 
      excitotoxic, and ischemic insults. Evidence is accumulating that the 
      mitochondrial fission/fusion equilibrium is an important determinant of cell 
      survival. Accordingly, we found that Bbeta2 expression induces mitochondrial 
      fragmentation, whereas Bbeta2 silencing or inhibition resulted in mitochondrial 
      elongation. Based on epistasis experiments involving Bcl2 and core components of 
      the mitochondrial fission machinery (Fis1 and dynamin-related protein 1), 
      mitochondrial fragmentation occurs upstream of apoptosis and is both necessary 
      and sufficient for hippocampal neuron death. Our data provide the first example 
      of a proapoptotic phosphatase that predisposes to neuronal death by promoting 
      mitochondrial division and point to a possible imbalance of the mitochondrial 
      morphogenetic equilibrium in the pathogenesis of SCA12.

TI  - PPP2R2B CAG repeat length in the Han Chinese in Taiwan: Association analyses in 
      neurological and psychiatric disorders and potential functional implications.
PG  - 124-9

AB  - PPP2R2B, a protein widely expressed in neurons throughout the brain, regulates 
      the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity for the microtubule-associated protein 
      tau and other substrates. Altered PP2A activity has been implicated in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia 12, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and other tauopathies. 
      Through a case-control study and a reporter assay, we investigated the 
      association of PPP2R2B CAG repeat polymorphism with Taiwanese AD, essential 
      tremor (ET), Parkinson's disease (PD), and schizophrenia and clarified the 
      functional implication of this polymorphism. The distribution of the alleles was 
      not significantly different between patients and controls, with 68.6-76.1% 
      alleles at lengths of 10, 13, and 16 triplets. No expanded alleles were detected 
      in either group. However, the frequency of the individuals carrying the short 5-, 
      6-, and 7-triplet alleles was notably higher in patients with AD (5/180 [2.8%], 
      Fisher's exact test, P = 0.003; including 2 homozygotes) and ET (4/132 [3.0%], 
      Fisher's exact test, P < 0.001) than in the controls (1/625 [0.2%]). The PPP2R2B 
      transcriptional activity was significantly lower in the luciferase reporter 
      constructs containing the (CAG)(5-7) allele than in those containing the common 
      10-, 13-, and 16-triplet alleles in both neuroblastoma and embryonic kidney 
      cells. Therefore, our preliminary results suggest that the PPP2R2B gene CAG 
      repeat polymorphism may be functional and may, in part, play a role in conferring 
      susceptibility to AD and ET in Taiwan.

TI  - Case control analysis of repeat expansion size in ataxia.
PG  - 28-32
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of clinically and genetically 
      heterogeneous neurological diseases. The expansion of unstable microsatellite 
      repeats has been identified as the underlying pathogenic cause of 10 subtypes of 
      autosomal dominant SCAs. The aetiology of sporadic SCA is unknown. The aim of 
      this study was to investigate the effect of large normal repeats in patients 
      presenting with sporadic or familial ataxia compared to a control population. The 
      size of the expansion was determined using a fluorescent PCR approach in 10 
      common SCA genes: SCA-1 (ATXN1), SCA-2 (ATXN2), SCA-3 (ATXN3), SCA-6 (CACNA1A), 
      SCA-7 (ATXN7), SCA-8 (ATXN8OS), SCA-10 (ATXN10), SCA-12 (PPP2R2B), SCA-17 (TBP) 
      and DRPLA (ATN1), in 165 ataxia patients and 307 controls of Welsh origin. There 
      was no difference between cases and controls in the distribution of the large 
      normal alleles, or in the distribution of the combined CAG repeats. The normal 
      allele distribution in the Welsh population was largely similar to that of other 
      Caucasian populations. Our study failed to demonstrate an effect of large normal 
      repeats on the susceptibility to develop ataxia.

TI  - Identification of the porcine homologous of human disease causing trinucleotide 
      repeat sequences.
PG  - 207-18
AB  - Expansion in the repeat number of intragenic trinucleotide repeats (TNRs) is 
      associated with a variety of inherited human neurodegenerative diseases. To study 
      the composition of TNRs in a mammalian species representing an evolutionary 
      intermediate between humans and rodents, we describe in this paper the 
      identification of porcine noncoding and polyglutamine-encoding TNR regions and 
      the comparison to the homologous TNRs from human, chimpanzee, dog, opossum, rat, 
      and mouse. Several of the porcine TNR regions are highly polymorphic both within 
      and between different breeds. The TNR regions are more conserved in terms of 
      repeat length between humans and pigs than between humans and rodents suggesting 
      that TNR lengths could be implicated in mammalian evolution. The TNRs in the 
      FMR2, SCA6, SCA12, and Huntingtin genes are comparable in length to alleles 
      naturally occurring in humans, and also in FMR1, a long uninterrupted CGG TNR was 
      identified. Most strikingly, we identified a Huntingtin allele with 21 
      uninterrupted CAG repeats encoding a stretch of 24 polyglutamines. Examination of 
      this particular Huntingtin TNR in 349 porcine offspring showed stable 
      transmission. The presence in the porcine genome of TNRs within genes that, in 
      humans, can undergo pathogenic expansions support the usage of the pig as an 
      alternative animal model for studies of TNR evolution, stability, and functional 
      properties.

TI  - Multiplex families with multiple system atrophy.
PG  - 545-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple system atrophy (MSA) has been considered a sporadic disease, 
      without patterns of inheritance. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical features of 
      4 multiplex families with MSA, including clinical genetic aspects. DESIGN: 
      Clinical and genetic study. SETTING: Four departments of neurology in Japan. 
      Patients Eight patients in 4 families with parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, and 
      autonomic failure with age at onset ranging from 58 to 72 years. Two siblings in 
      each family were affected with these conditions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical 
      evaluation was performed according to criteria by Gilman et al. Trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion in the responsible genes for the spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 
      series and for dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) was evaluated by 
      polymerase chain reaction. Direct sequence analysis of coding regions in the 
      alpha-synuclein gene was performed. RESULTS: Consanguineous marriage was observed 
      in 1 of 4 families. Among 8 patients, 1 had definite MSA, 5 had probable MSA, and 
      2 had possible MSA. The most frequent phenotype was MSA with predominant 
      parkinsonism, observed in 5 patients. Six patients showed pontine atrophy with 
      cross sign or slitlike signal change at the posterolateral putaminal margin or 
      both on brain magnetic resonance imaging. Possibilities of hereditary ataxias, 
      including SCA1 (ataxin 1, ATXN1), SCA2 (ATXN2), Machado-Joseph disease/SCA3 
      (ATXN1), SCA6 (ATXN1), SCA7 (ATXN7), SCA12 (protein phosphatase 2, regulatory 
      subunit B, beta isoform; PP2R2B), SCA17 (TATA box binding protein, TBP) and DRPLA 
      (atrophin 1; ATN1), were excluded, and no mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene 
      were found. CONCLUSIONS: Findings in these multiplex families suggest the 
      presence of familial MSA with autosomal recessive inheritance and a genetic 
      predisposition to MSA. Molecular genetic approaches focusing on familial MSA are 
      expected to provide clues to the pathogenesis of MSA.

TI  - Expanded trinucleotide repeats in the TBP/SCA17 gene mapped to chromosome 6q27 
      are associated with schizophrenia.
PG  - 131-6
AB  - Schizophrenia has a complex and non-Mendelian mode of inheritance. Recently, 
      trinucleotide repeat (TNR)-containing genes have been considered as the candidate 
      genes predisposing to schizophrenia. The purpose of this study was to determine 
      whether a genetic association could be observed between schizophrenia and the TNR 
      polymorphisms within the KLHL1AS/SCA8, PPP2R2B/SCA12, and TBP/SCA17 genes. We 
      studied 100 unrelated schizophrenia patients and 124 controls without evident 
      neurodegenerative or psychiatric disorders. The overall allele frequency 
      distributions of the KLHL1AS/SCA8 and PPP2R2B/SCA12 genes were not significantly 
      different between the schizophrenic patients and the control subjects (P>0.05). 
      The allele frequency distribution in the schizophrenic patients was significantly 
      different from that in the controls at the TBP/SCA17 gene (P=0.0149), with an 
      increased frequency of 36 repeats in the patients and two patients carrying 45 
      TNR expansions were identified. TBP/SCA17 is the TATA box binding protein gene 
      mapped to chromosome 6q27. The study suggests that TNR expansions of the 
      TBP/SCA17 gene may contribute to the genetic risk of schizophrenia in rare cases.

TI  - Comparative genetics of functional trinucleotide tandem repeats in humans and 
      apes.
PG  - 329-39
AB  - Several human neurodegenerative disorders are caused by the expansion of 
      polymorphic trinucleotide repeat regions. Many of these loci are functional short 
      tandem repeats (STRs) located in brain-expressed genes, and their study is thus 
      relevant from both a medical and an evolutionary point of view. The aims of our 
      study are to infer the comparative pattern of variation and evolution of this set 
      of loci in order to show species-specific features in this group of STRs and on 
      their potential for expansion (therefore, an insight into evolutionary medicine) 
      and to unravel whether any human-specific feature may be identified in 
      brain-expressed genes involved in human disease. We analyzed the variability of 
      the normal range of seven expanding STR CAG/CTG loci (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3-MJD, SCA6, 
      SCA8, SCA12, and DRPLA) and two nonexpanding polymorphic CAG loci (KCNN3 and 
      NCOA3) in humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. The study showed a 
      general conservation of the repetitive tract and of the polymorphism in the four 
      species and high heterogeneity among loci distributions. Humans present slightly 
      larger alleles than the rest of species but a more relevant difference appears in 
      variability levels: Humans are the species with the largest variance, although 
      only for the expanding loci, suggesting a relationship between variability levels 
      and expansion potential. The sequence analysis shows high levels of sequence 
      conservation among species, a lack of correspondence between interruption 
      patterns and variability levels, and signs of conservative selective pressure for 
      some of the STR loci. Only two loci (SCA1 and SCA8) show a human specific 
      distribution, with larger alleles than the rest of species. This could account, 
      at the same time, for a human-specific trait and a predisposition to disease 
      through expansion.

TI  - Molecular genetics of hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia: mutation analysis of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia genes and CAG/CTG repeat expansion detection in 225 
      Italian families.
PG  - 727-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias are a clinical and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of progressive neurodegenerative diseases, at present 
      associated with 22 loci (spinocerebellar ataxia [SCA] 1-SCA8, SCA10-SCA19, SCA21, 
      SCA22, fibroblast growth factor 14 [FGF14]-SCA, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy [DRPLA]). The relevant gene has been identified in 12 cases (SCA1-3, 
      SCA6-8, SCA10, SCA12, FGF14, and DRPLA), and in all but the recently identified 
      SCA14, SCA17, PRKCG and FGF14 genes, the defect consists of the expansion of a 
      short nucleotide repeat. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relative prevalence of 
      SCA1-3, SCA6-8, SCA10, SCA12, and SCA17 gene expansions in Italian families with 
      hereditary ataxia, specifically to verify the occurrence of SCA10, SCA12, and 
      SCA17 in Italy; and to analyze samples from probands with negative test results 
      at the initial screening by means of the repeat expansion detection technique to 
      identify CAG/CTG expansions in novel loci.Patients Two hundred twenty-five 
      unrelated Italian index cases with hereditary ataxia, most (n = 183) of whom 
      presented with a clear dominantly transmitted trait. RESULTS: We found that SCA1 
      and SCA2 gene mutations accounted for most cases (21% and 24%, respectively). We 
      found SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, and SCA17 to be very rare (approximately 1% each), 
      and no case of SCA10 or SCA12 was identified. Half of the index cases (113/225) 
      were negative for expansions in the known SCA genes. Repeat expansion detection 
      analysis performed on 111 of these cases showed a CAG/CTG repeat expansion of at 
      least 50 triplets in 22 (20%). Twenty-one of 22 expansions could be attributed to 
      length variation at 2 polymorphic loci (expanded repeat domain CAG/CTG 1 [ERDA1] 
      or CTG repeat on chromosome 18q21.1 [CTG18.1]). In 1 patient, the expansion was 
      assigned to the DRPLA gene. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of SCA1-3 and SCA6-7 
      gene mutations is peculiar in Italy. We found a relatively high frequency of SCA1 
      and SCA2 gene expansions; SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7 mutations were rare, compared with 
      other European countries. No SCA10 or SCA12 and only a few SCA8 (2/225) and SCA17 
      (2/225) families were detected. In patients negative for defects in known SCA 
      genes, repeat expansion detection data strongly suggest that, at least in our 
      population, CAG/CTG expansions in novel genes should be considered an unlikely 
      cause of the SCA phenotype.

TI  - Detection of large pathogenic expansions in FRDA1, SCA10, and SCA12 genes using a 
      simple fluorescent repeat-primed PCR assay.
PG  - 96-100
AB  - At least 18 human genetic diseases are caused by expansion of short tandem 
      repeats. Here we describe a successful application of a fluorescent PCR method 
      for the detection of expanded repeats in FRDA1, SCA10, and SCA12 genes. Although 
      this test cannot give a precise estimate of the size of the expansion, it is 
      robust, reliable, and inexpensive, and can be used to screen large series of 
      patients. It proved useful for confirming the presence of large expansions in the 
      Friedreich ataxia gene following an ambiguous result of long-range PCR, as well 
      as rapid pre-screening for large repeat expansions associated with Friedreich 
      ataxia and SCA10 and the shorter repeat expansions associated with SCA12.

TI  - Analysis of trinucleotide repeats in different SCA loci in spinocerebellar ataxia 
      patients and in normal population of Taiwan.
PG  - 355-60
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify various subtypes of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) among 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) patients referred to our research 
      center, SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD (Machado-Joseph disease), SCA6, SCA7, SCA8 and SCA12 
      loci were assessed for expansion of trinucleotide repeats. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      A total of 211 ADCA patients, including 202 patients with dominantly inherited 
      ataxia from 81 Taiwanese families and nine patients with sporadic ataxia, were 
      included in this study and subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. 
      The amplified products of all loci were analyzed on both 3% agarose gels and 6% 
      denaturing urea-polyacrylamide gels. PCR-based Southern blots were also applied 
      for the detection of SCA7 locus. RESULTS: The SCA1 mutation was detected in six 
      affected individuals from one family (1.2%) with expanded alleles of 50-53 CAG 
      repeats. Fourteen individuals from nine families (11%) had a CAG trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion at the SCA2 locus, while affected SCA2 alleles have 34-49 CAG 
      repeats. The SCA3/MJD CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in 60 affected 
      individuals from 26 families (32%) was expanded to 71-85 CAG repeats. As for the 
      SCA7 locus, there were two affected individuals from one family (1.2%) possessed 
      41 and 100 CAG repeats, respectively. However, we did not detect expansion in the 
      SCA6, SCA8 and SCA12 loci in any patient. CONCLUSIONS: The SCA3/MJD CAG expansion 
      was the most frequent mutation among the SCA patients. The relative prevalence of 
      SCA3/MJD in Taiwan was higher than that of SCA2, SCA1 and SCA7.

TI  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia: SCA2 is the most frequent mutation in 
      eastern India.
PG  - 448-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) has been reported as the 
      commonest dominant hereditary ataxia in India. However, India is an ethnically 
      and religiously diverse population. Previous studies have not clearly indicated 
      exact ethnic and religious origins, and must therefore be interpreted with 
      caution. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of different 
      SCA mutations in a relatively homogeneous population from eastern India. METHODS: 
      We identified 28 families with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia from eastern 
      India. Each underwent full clinical evaluation and were analysed for the presence 
      of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, and SCA17 mutations. In addition, 
      haplotype analysis was carried out in seven of the 16 families with SCA2. 
      RESULTS: Seven patients from four (14%) families were positive for an expansion 
      in SCA1 and 26 patients from 16 (57%) families were positive for an expansion in 
      SCA2. No mutations were detected in the remaining eight families (29%). Most of 
      the SCA1 and SCA2 families were Hindu from the state of Bihar. Five out of 26 
      SCA2 patients in this study did not have slow saccades. In addition, four of 
      seven SCA1 patients had slow saccades. We found an association between the SCA2 
      CAG repeat expansion and the 285 base pair (bp) allele of microsatellite marker 
      D12S1672, and also data supportive of the association between the expansion and 
      the 225 bp allele of D12S1333, which has been previously described. CONCLUSIONS: 
      We conclude that (1) although slow ocular saccades are highly suggestive of SCA2, 
      that they are not universal, nor are they exclusive to this disorder and (2) SCA2 
      is likely to be the commonest dominant ataxia in eastern India, with further 
      evidence for a founder effect.

TI  - Polymorphism of trinucleotide repeats in non-translated regions of SCA8 and SCA12 
      genes: allele distribution in a Polish control group.
PG  - 101-5
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias are a group of neurodegenerative disorders caused by 
      dynamic mutations of microsatellite repeats. Two novel forms of SCAs have been 
      described recently: SCA8, with expansions of CTA/CTG repeats in 3'UTR of the SCA8 
      gene, and SCA12, caused by expansion of the CAG tract in 5'UTR of the 
      SCA12/PP2R2B gene. Analysis of CTA/CTG and CAG polymorphism in those two genes 
      was performed in a Polish control group consisting of 100 individuals without any 
      neurological signs. The distribution and ranges of the number of non-pathogenic 
      repeats were similar to those observed in other populations described previously. 
      Expansion of CTA/CTG repeats in the SCA8 locus was found in 2 of 100 controls and 
      in 5 probands among 150 pedigrees affected with unidentified ataxias. As such 
      expanded alleles were also observed in their healthy relatives, the pathogenic 
      role of expansions in the SCA8 gene remains uncertain.

TI  - A novel autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA22) linked to chromosome 
      1p21-q23.
PG  - 1293-9
AB  - The autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) are a clinically, pathologically 
      and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders. Ten responsible genes have been 
      identified for spinocerebellar ataxia types SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, 
      SCA10, SCA12 and SCA17, and dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). The 
      mutation is caused by an expansion of a CAG, CTG or ATTCT repeat sequence of 
      these genes. Six additional loci, SCA4, SCA5, SCA11, SCA13, SCA14 and SCA16 have 
      also been mapped. The growing heterogeneity of the autosomal dominant forms of 
      these diseases shows that the genetic aetiologies of at least 20% of ADCA have 
      yet to be elucidated. We ascertained and clinically characterized a 
      four-generation Chinese pedigree segregating an autosomal dominant phenotype for 
      cerebellar ataxia. Direct mutation analysis, linkage analysis for all known SCA 
      loci and a genome-wide linkage study were performed. Direct mutation analysis 
      excluded SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 17 and DRPLA, and genetic linkage analysis 
      excluded SCA4, 5, 11, 13, 14 and 16. The genome-wide linkage study suggested 
      linkage to a locus on chromosome 1p21-q23, with the highest two-point LOD score 
      at D1S1167 (Zmax = 3.46 at theta = 0.00). Multipoint analysis and haplotype 
      reconstruction traced this novel SCA locus (SCA22) to a 43.7-cM interval flanked 
      by D1S206 and D1S2878 (Zmax = 3.78 under four liability classes, and 2.67 using 
      affected-only method). The age at onset ranged from 10 to 46 years. All affected 
      members had gait ataxia with variable features of dysarthria and hyporeflexia. 
      Head MRI showed homogeneous atrophy of the cerebellum without involvement of the 
      brainstem. In six parent-child pairs, median onset occurred 10 years earlier in 
      offspring than in their parents, suggesting anticipation. This family is distinct 
      from other families with SCA and is characterized by a slowly progressive, pure 
      cerebellar ataxia.

TI  - Analysis of SCA8 and SCA12 loci in 134 Italian ataxic patients negative for 
      SCA1-3, 6 and 7 CAG expansions.
PG  - 923-9
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      disorders, six of which are caused by expansion of a polyglutamine-coding CAG 
      repeats ( SCA1- 3, 6, 7 and 17). In addition, expansions of a CAG triplet in the 
      5' region of a gene and a CTG triplet in an antisense RNA have been demonstrated 
      in the SCA12 and SCA8 genes respectively. Our series of 134 ataxic patients (22 
      familial and 112 sporadic, tested negative for SCAI-3, 6, 7) was investigated for 
      the presence of triplet expansions in the SCA8 and SCA12 genes. No SCA12 
      expansion was identified. A moderate SCA8 expansion (85-97 repeats) was found in 
      two unrelated families with slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia. The frequency 
      of SCA8 expansion accounts for approximately 4.3 % of the whole pool of our 
      ataxia families (2 out of 46), while none of the 127 controls screened carried > 
      35 CTG+CTA repeats. Our data suggest a possible pathogenetic role of this 
      mutation, which at present is still controversial, and confirm the rarity of the 
      SCA12 expansion in Italian patients.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxias in the Netherlands: prevalence and age at onset variance 
      analysis.
PG  - 702-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: International prevalence estimates of autosomal dominant cerebellar 
      ataxias (ADCA) vary from 0.3 to 2.0 per 100,000. The prevalence of ADCA in the 
      Netherlands is unknown. Fifteen genetic loci have been identified (SCA-1-8, 
      SCA-10-14, SCA-16, and SCA-17) and nine of the corresponding genes have been 
      cloned. In SCA-1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA-12 and SCA-17 the mutation has been 
      shown to be an expanded CAG repeat. Previously, the length of the CAG repeat was 
      found to account for 50 to 80% of variance in age at onset. Because of 
      heterogeneity in encoded proteins, different pathophysiologic mechanisms leading 
      to neurodegeneration could be involved. The relationship between CAG repeat 
      length and age at onset would then differ accordingly. METHOD: Based on the 
      results of SCA mutation analysis in the three DNA diagnostic laboratories that 
      serve the entire Dutch population, the authors surveyed the number of families 
      and affected individuals per SCA gene, as well as individual repeat length and 
      age at onset. Regression analysis was applied to study the relationship between 
      CAG repeat length and age at onset per SCA gene. The slopes of the different 
      regression curves were compared. RESULTS: On November 1, 2000, mutations were 
      found in 145 ADCA families and 391 affected individuals were identified. The 
      authors extrapolated a minimal prevalence of 3.0 per 100,000 (range 2.8 to 
      3.8/100,000). SCA3 was the most frequent mutation. CAG repeat length contributed 
      to 52 to 76% of age at onset variance. Regression curve slopes for SCA-1, SCA2, 
      SCA3, and SCA7 did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated minimal 
      prevalence of ADCA in the Netherlands is 3.0 per 100,000 inhabitants. Except for 
      SCA6, the relationship between age at onset and CAG repeat expansion does not 
      differ significantly between SCA-1, SCA2, SCA3, and SCA7 patient groups in our 
      population, indicating that these SCA subtypes share similar mechanisms of 
      polyglutamine-induced neurotoxicity, despite heterogeneity in gene products.

TI  - Spastic paraplegia, ataxia, mental retardation (SPAR): a novel genetic disorder.
PG  - 411-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a kindred with a dominantly inherited neurologic disorder 
      manifested either as uncomplicated spastic paraplegia or ataxia, spastic 
      paraplegia, and mental retardation. METHODS: Neurologic examinations and 
      molecular genetic analysis (exclusion of known SCA and HSP genes and loci; and 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion detection [RED]) were performed in six affected 
      and four unaffected subjects in this family. MRI, electromyography (EMG), and 
      nerve conduction studies were performed in three affected subjects. RESULTS: The 
      phenotype of this dominantly inherited syndrome varied in succeeding generations. 
      Pure spastic paraplegia was present in the earliest generation; subsequent 
      generations had ataxia and mental retardation. MRI showed marked atrophy of the 
      spinal cord in all patients and cerebellar atrophy in those with ataxia. 
      Laboratory analysis showed that the disorder was not caused by mutations in genes 
      that cause SCA-1, SCA-2, SCA-3, SCA-6, SCA-7, SCA-8, and SCA-12; not linked to 
      other known loci for autosomal dominant ataxia (SCA-4, SCA-5, SCA-10, SCA-11, 
      SCA-13, SCA-14, and SCA-16); and not linked to known loci for autosomal dominant 
      hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) (SPG-3, SPG-4, SPG-6, SPG-8, SPG-9, SPG-10, 
      SPG-12, and SPG-13) or autosomal recessive HSP SPG-7. Analysis of 
      intergenerational differences in age at onset of symptoms suggests genetic 
      anticipation. Using RED, the authors did not detect expanded CAG, CCT, TGG, or 
      CGT repeats that segregate with the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The authors describe an 
      unusual, dominantly inherited neurologic disorder in which the phenotype (pure 
      spastic paraplegia or spastic ataxia with variable mental retardation) differed 
      in subsequent generations. The molecular explanation for apparent genetic 
      anticipation does not appear to involve trinucleotide repeat expansion.

TI  - SCA12 is a rare locus for autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia: a study of an 
      Indian family.
PG  - 117-21
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 12 (SCA12) is an autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia 
      (ADCA) described in a single family with a CAG repeat expansion in the PPP2R2B 
      gene. We screened 247 index cases, including 145 families with ADCA, for this 
      expansion. An expanded repeat ranging from 55 to 61 triplets was detected in 6 
      affected and 3 unaffected individuals at risk in a single family from India. The 
      association of the PPP2R2B CAG repeat expansion with disease in this new family 
      provides additional evidence that the mutation is causative.

TI  - SCA-12: Tremor with cerebellar and cortical atrophy is associated with a CAG 
      repeat expansion.
PG  - 299-303
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the clinical and neuroradiologic features of a new 
      spinocerebellar ataxia, SCA-12, in the index family. BACKGROUND: The authors 
      recently linked SCA-12 to a novel CAG repeat expansion on chromosome 5q31-33 that 
      is located within the 5' region of PPP2R2B, a gene encoding a brain-specific 
      regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A. METHODS: Neurologic features of the 
      proband and nine symptomatic relatives in the first SCA-12 family were compiled 
      and, in some individuals, related to changes found on brain MRI or CT. RESULTS: 
      SCA-12 typically presented in the 4th decade of life with action tremor of the 
      head or arms (present in 10/10 of the affected individuals). Hyperreflexia (8/10) 
      was a common feature, and cerebellar signs (8/10), including ataxia, dysmetria, 
      and dysarthria, developed gradually but were less prominent and disabling than 
      cerebellar dysfunction in other SCA. Subtle parkinsonian features (9/10) and 
      dementia (2/10) were observed in later stages of SCA-12, and psychiatric 
      symptoms, including depression, anxiety, or delusions, were present in some 
      affected family members (4/10). Two individuals studied had nondisabling 
      neurologic signs neonatally, including nystagmus and lower extremity dystonia. 
      Brain images of affected individuals revealed cerebral and cerebellar atrophy. 
      CONCLUSIONS: SCA-12 is a slowly progressive, autosomal dominant, 
      neurodegenerative disorder that differs from other SCA in that it typically 
      presents with action tremor in patients in their mid 30s and usually includes 
      hyperreflexia and subtle parkinsonian signs. Cerebellar dysfunction, including 
      gait ataxia, is relatively nondisabling, and cognitive or psychiatric disorders 
      may occur. Neuroradiologic studies reveal atrophy of the cerebellum and cerebral 
      cortex.

TI  - Clinical features and genetic analysis of a new form of spinocerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 234-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) are a clinically 
      heterogeneous group of disorders. The mutations for SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, 
      SCA8, and SCA-12 are identified and caused by an expansion of a CAG or a CTG 
      repeat sequence of these genes. Six additional loci for SCA4, SCA5, SCA-10, 
      SCA-11, SCA-13, and SCA-14 are mapped. The growing heterogeneity of the autosomal 
      dominant forms of these diseases shows that the genetic etiologies of at least 
      20% of ADCA have yet to be elucidated. METHODS: The authors ascertained and 
      clinically characterized a four-generation pedigree segregating an autosomal 
      dominant phenotype for SCA. Direct mutation analysis, repeat expansion detection 
      analysis, and linkage analysis for all known SCA loci were performed. RESULTS: 
      Direct mutational analysis excluded SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 12; genetic linkage 
      analysis excluded SCA4, 5,10, 11, 13, and 14, giving significant negative lod 
      scores. Examination of the family showed that all affected members had gait 
      ataxia and akinesia with variable features of dysarthria, hyporeflexia, and mild 
      intellectual impairment. Eye movements were normal. Head MRI showed atrophy of 
      the cerebellum without involvement of the brainstem. In 10 parent-child pairs, 
      median onset occurred 10.5 years earlier in offspring than in their parents, 
      suggesting anticipation. CONCLUSION: This family is distinct from other families 
      with SCA and is characterized by cerebellar ataxia and extrapyramidal signs.

TI  - Genetic background of apparently idiopathic sporadic cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 132-7
AB  - Disease-causing mutations have been identified in various entities of autosomal 
      dominant ataxia and in Friedreich's ataxia. However, no molecular pathogenic 
      factor is known to cause idiopathic cerebellar ataxias. We investigated the 
      CAG/CTG trinucleotide repeats causing spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 
      8 and 12, and the GAA repeat of the frataxin gene in 124 patients apparently 
      suffering from idiopathic sporadic ataxia, including 20 patients with the 
      clinical diagnosis of multiple system atrophy. Patients with a positive family 
      history, a typical Friedreich phenotype, or symptomatic ataxia were excluded. 
      Genetic analyses uncovered the most common Friedreich mutation in 10 patients 
      with an age at onset between 13 and 36 years. The SCA6 mutation was present in 
      nine patients with disease onset between 47 and 68 years of age. The CTG repeat 
      associated with SCA8 was expanded in three patients. One patient had SCA2 
      attributable to a de novo mutation from a paternally transmitted, intermediate 
      allele. We did not identify the SCA1, SCA3, SCA7 or SCA12 mutation in idiopathic 
      sporadic ataxia patients. No trinucleotide repeat expansion was detected in the 
      MSA subgroup. This study has revealed the genetic basis in 19% of apparently 
      idiopathic ataxia patients. SCA6 is the most frequent mutation in late onset 
      cerebellar ataxia. The frataxin trinucleotide expansion should be investigated in 
      all sporadic ataxia patients with onset before age 40, even when the phenotype is 
      atypical for Friedreich's ataxia.
