AB  - CGG repeat expansions in LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1 have recently been identified as a 
      cause of oculopharyngeal myopathy with leukoencephalopathy. However, since only 
      three patients from a single family were reported, it remains unknown whether 
      their clinicopathological features are typical for CGG repeat expansions in 
      LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1. Here, using repeat-primed-polymerase chain reaction 
      (RP-PCR) and long-read sequencing, we identify 12 individuals from 3 unrelated 
      families with CGG repeat expansions in LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1, typically presenting 
      with oculopharyngodistal myopathy. The CGG repeat expansions range from 161 to 
      669 repeat units. Most of the patients present with ptosis, restricted eye 
      movements, dysphagia, dysarthria, and diffuse limb muscle weakness. Only one 
      patient shows T2-weighted hyperintensity in the cerebellar white matter 
      surrounding the deep cerebellar nuclei on brain magnetic resonance imaging. 
      Muscle biopsies from three patients show a myopathic pattern and rimmed vacuoles. 
      Analyses of muscle biopsies suggest that CGG repeat expansions in 
      LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1 may deleteriously affect aggrephagic capacity, suggesting 
      that ribonucleic acid (RNA) toxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction may contribute 
      to pathogenesis. Our study thus expands the phenotypic spectrum for the CGG 
      repeat expansion of LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1 and indicates that this genetic variant 
      typically manifests as oculopharyngodistal myopathy with chronic myopathic 
      changes with rimmed vacuoles and filamentous intranuclear inclusions in muscle 
      fibers.

TI  - Non-coding CGG repeat expansion in LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1 is associated with a 
      phenotype of oculopharyngodistal myopathy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is a rare adult-onset 
      neuromuscular disease, associated with CGG repeat expansions in the 5' 
      untranslated region of LRP12, GIPC1, NOTCH2NLC and RILPL1. However, the genetic 
      cause of a proportion of pathoclinically confirmed cases remains unknown. 
      METHODS: A total of 26 OPDM patients with unknown genetic cause(s) from 4 
      tertiary referral hospitals were included in this study. Clinical data and 
      laboratory findings were collected. Muscle samples were observed by histological 
      and immunofluorescent staining. Long-read sequencing was initially conducted in 
      six patients with OPDM. Repeat-primed PCR was used to screen the CGG repeat 
      expansions in LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1 in all 26 patients. RESULTS: We identified CGG 
      repeat expansion in the non-coding transcripts of LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1 in another 
      two unrelated Chinese cases with typical pathoclinical features of OPDM. The 
      repeat expansion was more than 70 times in the patients but less than 40 times in 
      the normal controls. Both patients showed no leucoencephalopathy but one showed 
      mild cognitive impairment detected by Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Rimmed 
      vacuoles and p62-positive intranuclear inclusions (INIs) were identified in 
      muscle pathology, and colocalisation of CGG RNA foci with p62 was also found in 
      the INIs of patient-derived fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: We identified another two 
      unrelated cases with CGG repeat expansion in the long non-coding RNA of the 
      LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1 gene, presenting with a phenotype of OPDM. Our cases 
      broadened the recognised phenotypic spectrum and pathogenesis in the disease 
      associated with CGG repeat expansion in LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1.

TI  - GIPC1 CGG Repeat Expansion Is Associated with Movement Disorders.
PG  - 704-715
LID - 10.1002/ana.26325 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: CGG/GGC repeat expansion in FMR1 and NOTCH2NLC is reportedly 
      associated with movement disorders; therefore, we hypothesized that the CGG 
      repeat expansion in LRP12, NUTM2B-AS1, and GIPC1, which was previously identified 
      in myopathy, might also be associated with movement-disorder phenotypes. Here, we 
      investigated whether CGG repeat expansion in LRP12, NUTM2B-AS1, and GIPC1 
      presents in a cohort of patients with movement disorders. METHODS: We screened 
      for the CGG repeat expansion in LRP12, NUTM2B-AS1, and GIPC1 in 1,346 
      movement-disorder patients and 1,451 matched healthy controls. RESULTS: No 
      patients or controls harbored expanded CGG repeats in LRP12 or NUTM2B-AS1, 
      whereas 16 patients harbored >40 CGG repeats in GIPC1, with 11 of these patients 
      harboring >60 CGG repeats. One control individual harbored an expanded GIPC1 
      allele (83 CGG units), suggesting that approximately 1% of patients affected by 
      movement disorders in our population might harbor GIPC1 CGG repeat expansion, 
      with this likely extremely rare in healthy controls (<0.001). The clinical 
      phenotypes of the GIPC1 CGG repeat-positive patients strongly resembled those in 
      patients displaying NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat-positive movement disorders. 
      Additionally, the GIPC1 CGG repeat-positive patients presented white-matter 
      hyperintensities but without typical NOTCH2NLC-related high-intensity signals in 
      the corticomedullary junction. Furthermore, 44% of the GIPC1 CGG repeat-positive 
      patients showed a cognitive deficit, and skin biopsies in 2 patients revealed 
      deposition of intranuclear inclusions. INTERPRETATION: The CGG repeat expansion 
      in GIPC1 might be associated with movement-disorder phenotypes and lead to 
      diseases related to intranuclear inclusions. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:704-715.

TI  - Noncoding CGG repeat expansions in neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease, 
      oculopharyngodistal myopathy and an overlapping disease.
PG  - 1222-1232
LID - 10.1038/s41588-019-0458-z [doi]
AB  - Noncoding repeat expansions cause various neuromuscular diseases, including 
      myotonic dystrophies, fragile X tremor/ataxia syndrome, some spinocerebellar 
      ataxias, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and benign adult familial myoclonic 
      epilepsies. Inspired by the striking similarities in the clinical and 
      neuroimaging findings between neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) and 
      fragile X tremor/ataxia syndrome caused by noncoding CGG repeat expansions in 
      FMR1, we directly searched for repeat expansion mutations and identified 
      noncoding CGG repeat expansions in NBPF19 (NOTCH2NLC) as the causative mutations 
      for NIID. Further prompted by the similarities in the clinical and neuroimaging 
      findings with NIID, we identified similar noncoding CGG repeat expansions in two 
      other diseases: oculopharyngeal myopathy with leukoencephalopathy and 
      oculopharyngodistal myopathy, in LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1 and LRP12, respectively. 
      These findings expand our knowledge of the clinical spectra of diseases caused by 
      expansions of the same repeat motif, and further highlight how directly searching 
      for expanded repeats can help identify mutations underlying diseases.
