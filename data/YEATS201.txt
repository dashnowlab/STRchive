TI  - FAME4-associating YEATS2 knockdown impairs dopaminergic synaptic integrity and 
      leads to seizure-like behaviours in Drosophila melanogaster.

AB  - Familial adult myoclonus epilepsy (FAME) is a neurological disorder caused by a 
      TTTTA/TTTCA intronic repeat expansion. FAME4 is one of the six types of FAME that 
      results from the repeat expansion in the first intron of the gene YEATS2. 
      Although the RNA toxicity is believed to be the primary mechanism underlying 
      FAME, the role of genes where repeat expansions reside is still unclear, 
      particularly in the case of YEATS2 in neurons. This study used Drosophila to 
      explore the effects of reducing YEATS2 expression. Two pan-neuronally driven 
      dsDNA were used for knockdown of Drosophila YEATS2 (dYEATS2), and the resulting 
      molecular and behavioural outcomes were evaluated. Drosophila with reduced 
      dYEATS2 expression exhibited decreased tolerance to acute stress, disturbed 
      locomotion, abnormal social behaviour, and decreased motivated activity. 
      Additionally, reducing dYEATS2 expression negatively affected tyrosine 
      hydroxylase (TH) gene expression, resulting in decreased dopamine biosynthesis. 
      Remarkably, seizure-like behaviours induced by knocking down dYEATS2 were rescued 
      by the administration of L-DOPA. This study reveals a novel role of YEATS2 in 
      neurons in regulating acute stress responses, locomotion, and complex behaviours, 
      and suggests that haploinsufficiency of YEATS2 may play a role in FAME4.

TI  - TTTCA repeat insertions in an intron of YEATS2 in benign adult familial myoclonic 
      epilepsy type 4.

AB  - Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder and identification of its causes is 
      important for a better understanding of its pathogenesis. We previously studied a 
      Thai family with a type of epilepsy, benign adult familial myoclonic epilepsy 
      type 4 (BAFME4), and localized its gene to chromosome 3q26.32-q28. Here, we used 
      single-molecule real-time sequencing and found expansions of TTTTA and insertions 
      of TTTCA repeats in intron 1 of YEATS2 in one affected member of the family. Of 
      all the available members in the family-comprising 13 affected and eight 
      unaffected-repeat-primed PCR and long-range PCR revealed the co-segregation of 
      the TTTCA repeat insertions with the TTTTA repeat expansions and the disease 
      status. For 1116 Thai control subjects, none were found to harbour the TTTCA 
      repeats while four had the TTTTA repeat expansions. Therefore, our findings 
      suggest that BAFME4 is caused by the insertions of the intronic TTTCA repeats in 
      YEATS2. Interestingly, all four types of BAFMEs for which underlying genes have 
      been found (BAFMEs 1, 4, 6 and 7) are caused by the same molecular pathology, 
      suggesting that the insertions of non-coding TTTCA repeats are involved in their 
      pathogenesis.
