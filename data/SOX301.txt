AB  - Presynaptic homeostatic plasticity (PHP) adaptively regulates synaptic 
      transmission in health and disease. Despite identification of numerous genes that 
      are essential for PHP, we lack a dynamic framework to explain how PHP is 
      initiated, potentiated, and limited to achieve precise control of vesicle fusion. 
      Here, utilizing both mice and Drosophila, we demonstrate that PHP progresses 
      through the assembly and physical expansion of presynaptic signaling foci where 
      activated integrins biochemically converge with trans-synaptic 
      Semaphorin2b/PlexinB signaling. Each component of the identified signaling 
      complexes, including alpha/beta-integrin, Semaphorin2b, PlexinB, talin, and focal 
      adhesion kinase (FAK), and their biochemical interactions, are essential for PHP. 
      Complex integrity requires the Sema2b ligand and complex expansion includes a 
       approximately 2.5-fold expansion of active-zone associated puncta composed of the 
      actin-binding protein talin. Finally, complex pre-expansion is sufficient to 
      accelerate the rate and extent of PHP. A working model is proposed incorporating 
      signal convergence with dynamic molecular assemblies that instruct PHP.

TI  - Identification of an SRY-negative 46,XX infertility male with a heterozygous 
      deletion downstream of SOX3 gene.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A male individual with a karyotype of 46,XX is very rare. We explored 
      the genetic aetiology of an infertility male with a kayrotype of 46,XX and SRY 
      negative. METHODS: The peripheral blood sample was collected from the patient and 
      subjected to a few genetic testing, including chromosomal karyotyping, 
      azoospermia factor (AZF) deletion, short tandem repeat (STR) analysis for AMELX, 
      AMELY and SRY, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with specific probes for 
      CSP 18/CSP X/CSP Y/SRY, chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) for genomic copy 
      number variations(CNVs), whole-genome analysis(WGA) for genomic SNV&InDel 
      mutation, and X chromosome inactivation (XCI) analysis. RESULTS: The patient had 
      a karyotype of 46,XX. AZF analysis showed that he missed the AZF region 
      (including a, b and c) and SRY gene. STR assay revealed he possessed the AMELX in 
      the X chromosome, but he had no the AMELY and SRY in the Y chromosome. FISH 
      analysis with CSP X/CSP Y/SRY showed only two X centromeric signals, but none Y 
      chromosome and SRY. The above results of the karyotype, FISH and STR analysis did 
      not suggest a Y chromosome chimerism existed in the patient's peripheral blood. 
      The result of the CMA indicated a heterozygous deletion with an approximate size 
      of 867 kb in Xq27.1 (hg19: chrX: 138,612,879-139,480,163 bp), located at 104 kb 
      downstream of SOX3 gene, including F9, CXorf66, MCF2 and ATP11C. WGA also 
      displayed the above deletion fragment but did not present known pathogenic or 
      likely pathogenic SNV&InDel mutation responsible for sex determination and 
      development. XCI assay showed that he had about 75% of the X chromosome 
      inactivated. CONCLUSIONS: Although the pathogenicity of 46,XX male patients with 
      SRY negative remains unclear, SOX3 expression of the acquired function may be 
      associated with partial testis differentiation of these patients. Therefore, the 
      CNVs analysis of the SOX3 gene and its regulatory region should be performed 
      routinely for these patients.

AB  - of molecular species is needed for applications in diagnosis of infections and 
      genetic diseases. Herein, we demonstrate a target DNA-responsive ultrahigh 
      fluorescence signal-on DNA amplification system via periodically programmed 
      building and collapse of DNA networks. In this system, a pair of oligonucleotides 
      of padlock probe (PP) and palindromic hairpin probe (PHP) are utilized. The 
      presence of target DNA firstly hybridizes with PP, allowing the occurrence of 
      rolling circle amplification (RCA) to produce RCA products with tandem repeats in 
      abundance to bind and unfold numbers of PHPs. The conformational change of PHPs 
      enables the building of DNA networks via the intermolecular palindrome pairing, 
      but then makes the DNA networks collapsed via the palindrome-induced strand 
      displacement polymerization. The displaced RCA products are dynamically reused to 
      undergo periodically programmed multiple rounds of DNA network building and 
      collapse. Depend on the bidirectional DNA assembly and disassembly, a strikingly 
      amplified fluorescence can be collected to ultrasensitive and specific detection 
      of target DNA. The practicability has been demonstrated by evaluating 
      target-spiked human serum, saliva, and urine samples with acceptable recoveries 
      and reproducibility. Therefore, this newly explored method opens a promising 
      avenue for the detection of nucleic acids with low abundance in biochemical 
      analysis and diseases diagnosis.

TI  - Complex Genomic Rearrangement Within the GNAS Region Associated With Familial 
      Pseudohypoparathyroidism Type 1b.
PG  - 2623-7
LID - 10.1210/jc.2016-1725 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1b (PHP-1b) results from methylation 
      defects at the G protein stimulatory alpha subunit (GNAS) exon A/B-differentially 
      methylated region (DMR). Although microduplications in the GNAS region were 
      recently identified in two PHP-1b patients, genetic information on these patients 
      remained fragmentary. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 20-year-old Japanese male and his 
      mother presented with hypocalcemia and elevated blood levels of intact PTH. The 
      proband had a maternal uncle who was previously diagnosed with PHP-1b. 
      Methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, 
      array-based comparative genomic hybridization, pyrosequencing, fluorescence in 
      situ hybridization, and whole-genome sequencing were performed for this family. 
      The proband, mother, and uncle carried maternally derived approximately 133-kb 
      duplication-triplication-duplication rearrangements at 20q13.32 involving NESP55, 
      NESPAS, XLalphas, and exon A/B-DMR but not STX16 or the Gsalpha coding region. These 
      individuals exhibited partial methylation defects of NESP55-, NESPAS-, and 
      XLalphas-DMRs, which were ascribable to the increased copy numbers of these regions 
      retaining the maternally derived methylation pattern and loss of methylation of 
      exon A/B-DMR, which was inexplicable by the copy-number alterations. Fusion 
      junctions of the rearrangement resided within non-repeat sequences and were 
      accompanied by short-templated insertions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that 
      maternally derived copy-number gains in the GNAS region mediated by nonhomologous 
      end-joining and/or by break-induced replication can underlie autosomal dominant 
      PHP-1b. These rearrangements likely affect methylation of exon A/B-DMR by 
      disconnecting or disrupting its cis-acting regulator(s). This study provides a 
      novel example of human disorders resulting from functional disturbance in the 
      cis-regulatory machinery of DNA methylation.

AB  - Polyglutamine (polyGln) expansions in nine human proteins result in neurological 
      diseases and induce the proteins' tendency to form beta-rich amyloid fibrils and 
      intracellular deposits. Less well known are at least nine other human diseases 
      caused by polyalanine (polyAla)-expansion mutations in different proteins. The 
      mechanisms of how polyAla aggregates under physiological conditions remain 
      unclear and controversial. We show here that aggregation of polyAla is 
      mechanistically dissimilar to that of polyGln and hence does not exhibit amyloid 
      kinetics. PolyAla assembled spontaneously into alpha-helical clusters with diverse 
      oligomeric states. Such clustering was pervasive in cells irrespective of visible 
      aggregate formation, and it disrupted the normal physiological oligomeric state 
      of two human proteins natively containing polyAla: ARX and SOX3. This 
      self-assembly pattern indicates that polyAla expansions chronically disrupt 
      protein behavior by imposing a deranged oligomeric status.

AB  - Polyalanine expansions in transcription factors have been associated with eight 
      distinct congenital human diseases. It is thought that in each case the 
      polyalanine expansion causes misfolding of the protein that abrogates protein 
      function. Misfolded proteins form aggregates when expressed in vitro; however, it 
      is less clear whether aggregation is of relevance to these diseases in vivo. To 
      investigate this issue, we used targeted mutagenesis of embryonic stem (ES) cells 
      to generate mice with a polyalanine expansion mutation in Sox3 (Sox3-26ala) that 
      is associated with X-linked Hypopituitarism (XH) in humans. By investigating both 
      ES cells and chimeric mice, we show that endogenous polyalanine expanded SOX3 
      does not form protein aggregates in vivo but rather is present at dramatically 
      reduced levels within the nucleus of mutant cells. Importantly, the residual 
      mutant protein of chimeric embryos is able to rescue a block in gastrulation but 
      is not sufficient for normal development of the hypothalamus, a region that is 
      functionally compromised in Sox3 null embryos and individuals with XH. Together, 
      these data provide the first definitive example of a disease-relevant PA mutant 
      protein that is both nuclear and functional, thereby manifesting as a partial 
      loss-of-function allele.

AB  - Molecular markers play a significant role for crop improvement in desirable 
      characteristics, such as high yield, resistance to disease and others that will 
      benefit the crop in long term. Pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L.) is the recently 
      sequenced legume by global consortium led by ICRISAT (Hyderabad, India) and been 
      analysed for gene prediction, synteny maps, markers, etc. We present PIgeonPEa 
      Microsatellite DataBase (PIPEMicroDB) with an automated primer designing tool for 
      pigeonpea genome, based on chromosome wise as well as location wise search of 
      primers. Total of 123 387 Short Tandem Repeats (STRs) were extracted from 
      pigeonpea genome, available in public domain using MIcroSAtellite tool (MISA). 
      The database is an online relational database based on 'three-tier architecture' 
      that catalogues information of microsatellites in MySQL and user-friendly 
      interface is developed using PHP. Search for STRs may be customized by limiting 
      their location on chromosome as well as number of markers in that range. This is 
      a novel approach and is not been implemented in any of the existing marker 
      database. This database has been further appended with Primer3 for primer 
      designing of selected markers with left and right flankings of size up to 500 bp. 
      This will enable researchers to select markers of choice at desired interval over 
      the chromosome. Furthermore, one can use individual STRs of a targeted region 
      over chromosome to narrow down location of gene of interest or linked 
      Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs). Although it is an in silico approach, markers' 
      search based on characteristics and location of STRs is expected to be beneficial 
      for researchers. Database URL: http://cabindb.iasri.res.in/pigeonpea/

TI  - RiDs db: Repeats in diseases database.
PG  - 96-7
AB  - The non-coding fraction of the human genome, which is approximately 98%, is 
      mainly constituted by repeats. Transpositions, expansions and deletions of these 
      repeat elements contribute to a number of diseases. None of the available 
      databases consolidates information on both tandem and interspersed repeats with 
      the flexibility of FASTA based homology search with reference to disease genes. 
      Repeats in diseases database (RiDs db) is a web accessible relational database, 
      which aids analysis of repeats associated with Mendelian disorders. It is a 
      repository of disease genes, which can be searched by FASTA program or by 
      limitedor free- text keywords. Unlike other databases, RiDs db contains the 
      sequences of these genes with access to corresponding information on both 
      interspersed and tandem repeats contained within them, on a unified platform. 
      Comparative analysis of novel or patient sequences with the reference sequences 
      in RiDs db using FASTA search will indicate change in structure of repeats, if 
      any, with a particular disorder. This database also provides links to orthologs 
      in model organisms such as zebrafish, mouse and Drosophila. AVAILABILITY: The 
      database is available for free at http://115.111.90.196/ridsdb/index.php.

TI  - Comparative analysis of SOX3 protein orthologs: Expansion of homopolymeric amino 
      acid tracts during vertebrate evolution.
PG  - 612-23
LID - 10.1007/s10528-010-9343-2 [doi]
AB  - To understand more fully the structure and evolution of the SOX3 protein, we 
      comparatively analyzed its orthologs in vertebrates. Since complex disorders are 
      associated with human SOX3 polyalanine expansions, our investigation focused on 
      both compositional and evolutionary analysis of various homopolymeric amino acid 
      tracts observed in SOX3 orthologs. Our analysis revealed that the observed 
      homopolymeric alanine, glycine, and proline tracts are mammal-specific, except 
      for one polyglycine tract present in birds. Since it is likely that the SOX3 
      protein acquired additional roles in brain development in Eutheria, we might 
      speculate that development of novel brain functions during the course of 
      evolution was affected, at least in part, by such structural-functional changes 
      in the SOX3 protein.

TI  - Polyalanine expansion mutations in the X-linked hypopituitarism gene SOX3 result 
      in aggresome formation and impaired transactivation.
PG  - 2085-95
AB  - Polyalanine expansion mutations have been identified in eight transcription 
      factors that are associated with a range of congenital disorders. While some of 
      these mutant proteins have been shown to generate cellular aggregates in 
      heterologous cell lines, little is known about the mechanism by which these 
      aggregates cause disease. Here we examine the aggregation and functional 
      properties of the two known polyalanine expansion mutations associated with 
      X-linked Hypopituitarism (XH), SOX3(22Ala) and SOX3(26Ala), which contain an 
      additional seven and eleven alanine residues, respectively. SOX3(22Ala) and 
      SOX3(26Ala) proteins form cytoplasmic aggregates and nuclear inclusions in 
      transiently transfected COS-7 and CHO K1 cells, and in transfected explant 
      cultures of chick neural epithelium. SOX3(26Ala) exhibits a more potent 
      aggregation phenotype, resulting in significantly more cells with dispersed 
      cytoplasmic and large perinuclear aggregates. SOX3(22Ala) and SOX3(26Ala) protein 
      aggregates exhibit the key properties of aggresomes including vimentin 
      redistribution, colocalisation with the Microtubule Organising Centre and 
      sensitivity to microtubule disruption. This is the first time that aggresomes 
      have been implicated in the aetiology of a polyalanine expansion disorder, 
      suggesting that XH and protein conformation disorders may become manifest through 
      similar pathological mechanisms. Further, we show that mutant SOX3 proteins have 
      impaired transcriptional activity and reduced capacity to inhibit 
      beta-catenin/TCF-mediated transcription. These data suggest that deregulation of 
      SOX3 target genes and inappropriate canonical Wnt signaling in central nervous 
      system (CNS) progenitors may also contribute to dysfunction of the 
      hypothalamic-pituitary axis in XH patients.

TI  - Analysis of the P3 promoter of the human parathyroid hormone (PTH)/PTH-related 
      peptide receptor gene in pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1b.
PG  - 1394-7
AB  - Hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia caused by PTH resistance are the only 
      discernible abnormalities in pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1b (PHP-1b). Because 
      of the selective resistance toward PTH, inactivating mutations in its receptor, 
      the PTH/PTH-related peptide receptor (PTHR1), were thought to be responsible for 
      PHP-1b. However, gene abnormalities responsible for PHP-1b have not been 
      identified in the coding region and well conserved promoters (P1 and P2) of the 
      PTHR1 gene. The purpose of the present study was to analyze the structure of the 
      P3 promoter, the main promoter of the human PTHR1 gene in kidney, in patients 
      with PHP-1b. Southern analysis of genomic DNA from lymphoblastoid cell lines of 
      eight nonfamilial patients with PHP-1b revealed neither gross rearrangements nor 
      methylation abnormalities in the P3 promoter region of the PTHR1 gene. Sequencing 
      revealed no abnormalities in the P3 promoter region, although one patient was 
      homozygous for an (AAAG)n polymorphic variant. In conclusion, despite the 
      selective resistance toward PTH in the kidney, which mainly uses the PTHR1 P3 
      promoter, PHP-1b in eight cases is not associated with structural abnormalities 
      in this promoter. This study also indicates that inactivation of the P3 promoter 
      is not achieved by methylation as tested in patients' genomic DNA from 
      lymphoblastoid cell lines. The influence of alterations in the polymorphic A-rich 
      repeat sequence on promoter activity warrants further study.

TI  - Abnormal calcium metabolism in myotonic dystrophy as shown by the 
      Ellsworth-Howard test and its relation to CTG triplet repeat length.
PG  - 613-22
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by 
      peculiar clinical features. Its molecular basis is the unstable expansion of a 
      CTG triplet repeat in the gene encoding myotonin protein kinase (Mt-PK), the 
      nucleotide sequence of which has extensive homology to the cyclic AMP 
      (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase gene. Extensive efforts have been made to clarify 
      the signal transduction pathway in which the responsible gene operates, but 
      confirming evidence has yet to be obtained. Because some symptoms in DM are 
      similar to those in hypoparathyroidism, we divided 24 DM patients into two groups 
      on the basis of their serum calcium levels; Group 1, those with normocalcemia (11 
      patients), and group 2, those with hypocalcemia (13 patients). The highly 
      sensitive parathyroid hormone (HS-PTH) plasma levels in group 1 were within 
      normal limits, whereas those in group 2 were abnormally high. Laboratory findings 
      for the group 2 patients resembled those for pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP), 
      whereas those for group 1 patients were normal. The Ellsworth-Howard (EH) test 
      was used to determine which type of PHP the group 2 patients belonged to. Both 
      the phosphaturic (delta P) and urinary cAMP (UcAMP) responses were estimated. The 
      delta P responses in group 2 were significantly lower than those in group 1, but 
      their UcAMP responses did not differ. This is evidence that group 2 patients had 
      PHP type II, whereas group 1 patients were normal. We also investigated whether 
      the disease severity differed between the groups. Cataracts, ectopic 
      calcifications, and ossifications, which are associated with PHP, were more 
      frequent in group 2. In addition, the mean IQ in that group was significantly 
      lower. Clinically, the group 2 signs agreed well with those of PHP, whereas for 
      group 1 there was only a slight similarity. These results are additional evidence 
      that the patients in group 2 have abnormal calcium metabolism, the abnormality 
      being in the postadenylate cyclase-cAMP pathway in the renal tubular cells. The 
      degree of (CTG)n expansion, the so-called expanded DNA fragment (EF) size, was 
      determined by standard Southern blot analysis. The allelic EF sizes in both 
      groups were greater than in the healthy controls. Moreover, those in group 2 were 
      significantly longer than those in group 1. We therefore investigated whether EF 
      size is correlated with the serum calcium and plasma PTH levels, the delta P 
      responses in the EH test, and IQ. All these items were significantly correlated 
      with EF size. Our findings show that the expanded DNA fragment size in DM is 
      correlated with the degree of abnormal calcium metabolism.
