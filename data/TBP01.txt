TI  - Dilemma in Differentiation of Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 17 from Huntington's 
      Disease...Comorbidity or Independent Disease?
PG  - 1-9

AB  - Both Huntington's disease (HD) and Spinocerebellar ataxia 17 (SCA17) mutations 
      showed expanded CAG repeats, with overlapping clinical manifestation: motor 
      disorders, psychiatric symptoms and cognitive impairments. Therefore, SCA17 is 
      also called Huntington like disease (HD-like, HDL) type 4. In this paper, we 
      reported that one patient had 47 CAG repeats in HTT gene and 42 CAG repeats in 
      TBP gene. There is a dilemma in differentiation of SCA 17 from HD in one patient, 
      never been reported before. Is the diagnosis comorbidity of HD with SCA17 or HD 
      only?

AB  - Pathogenic short tandem repeat (STR) expansions cause over 20 neurodegenerative 
      diseases. To determine the contribution of STRs in sporadic amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), we used ExpansionHunter, 
      REviewer, and polymerase chain reaction validation to assess 21 neurodegenerative 
      disease-associated STRs in whole-genome sequencing data from 608 patients with 
      sporadic ALS, 68 patients with sporadic FTD, and 4703 matched controls. We also 
      propose a data-derived outlier detection method for defining allele thresholds in 
      rare STRs. Excluding C9orf72 repeat expansions, 17.6% of clinically diagnosed ALS 
      and FTD cases had at least one expanded STR allele reported to be pathogenic or 
      intermediate for another neurodegenerative disease. We identified and validated 
      162 disease-relevant STR expansions in C9orf72 (ALS/FTD), ATXN1 [spinal 
      cerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1)], ATXN2 (SCA2), ATXN8 (SCA8), TBP (SCA17), HTT 
      (Huntington's disease), DMPK [myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1)], CNBP (DM2), and 
      FMR1 (fragile-X disorders). Our findings suggest clinical and pathological 
      pleiotropy of neurodegenerative disease genes and highlight their importance in 
      ALS and FTD.

AB  - Usually, molecular diagnosis of spinocerebellar ataxia is based on a step-by-step 
      approach with targeted sizing of four repeat expansions accounting for most 
      dominant cases, then targeted sequencing of other genes. Nowadays, genome 
      sequencing allows detection of most pathogenic variants in a single step. The 
      ExpansionHunter tool can detect expansions in short-read genome sequencing data. 
      Recent studies have shown that ExpansionHunter can also be used to identify 
      repeat expansions in exome sequencing data. We tested ExpansionHunter on 
      spinocerebellar ataxia exomes in a research context as a second-line analysis, 
      after exclusion of main CAG repeat expansions in half of the probands. First, we 
      confirmed the detection of expansions in seven known expansion carriers and then, 
      after targeted analysis of ATXN1, 2, 3 and 7, CACNA1A, TBP, ATN1, NOP56, AR and 
      HTT in 498 exomes, we found 22 additional pathogenic expansions. Comparison with 
      capillary migration sizing in 247 individuals and confirmation of all expanded 
      alleles detected by ExpansionHunter demonstrated that for these loci, sensitivity 
      and specificity reached 100%. ExpansionHunter detected but underestimated the 
      repeat size for larger expansions, and the normal alleles distribution at each 
      locus should be taken into account to detect expansions. Exome combined with 
      ExpansionHunter is reliable to detect repeat expansions in selected loci as 
      first-line analysis in spinocerebellar ataxia.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 17-digenic TBP/STUB1 disease: neuropathologic 
      features of an autopsied patient.
PG  - 177
LID - 10.1186/s40478-022-01486-6 [doi]
LID - 177
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 17-digenic TBP/STUB1 disease (SCA17-DI) has 
      been recently segregated from SCA17, caused by digenic inheritance of two gene 
      mutations - intermediate polyglutamine-encoding CAG/CAA repeat expansions (polyQ) 
      in TBP (TBP(41 - 49)) and STUB1 heterozygosity - the former being associated with 
      SCA17, and the latter with SCA48 and SCAR16 (autosomal recessive). In SCA17, most 
      patients carry intermediate TBP(41 - 49) alleles but show incomplete penetrance, 
      and the missing heritability can be explained by a new entity whereby 
      TBP(41 - 49) requires the STUB1 variant to be symptomatic. The STUB1 gene encodes 
      the chaperone-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase (CHIP) involved in 
      ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal control of protein homeostasis. However, reports 
      of the neuropathology are limited and role of STUB1 mutations in SCA17-DI remain 
      unknown. Here we report the clinicopathologic features of identical twin 
      siblings, one of whom was autopsied and was found to carry an intermediate allele 
      (41 and 38 CAG/CAA repeats) in TBP and a heterozygous missense mutation in STUB1 
      (p.P243L). These patients developed autosomal recessive Huntington's disease-like 
      symptoms. Brain MRI showed diffuse atrophy of the cerebellum and T2WI revealed 
      hyperintense lesions in the basal ganglia and periventricular deep white matter. 
      The brain histopathology of the patient shared features characteristic of SCA17, 
      such as degeneration of the cerebellar cortex and caudate nucleus, and presence 
      of 1C2-positive neurons. Here we show that mutant CHIP fails to generate the 
      polyubiquitin chain due to disrupted folding of the entire U box domain, thereby 
      affecting the E3 activity of CHIP. When encountering patients with cerebellar 
      ataxia, especially those with Huntington's disease-like symptoms, genetic testing 
      for STUB1 as well as TBP should be conducted for diagnosis of SCA17-DI, even in 
      cases of sporadic or autosomal recessive inheritance.

AB  - PURPOSE: CAG/CAA repeat expansions in TBP(>49) are responsible for 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 17 (SCA17). We previously detected 
      cosegregation of STUB1 variants causing SCA48 with intermediate alleles of TBP in 
      2 families. This cosegregation questions the existence of SCA48 as a monogenic 
      disease. METHODS: We systematically sequenced TBP repeats in 34 probands of 
      dominant ataxia families with STUB1 variants. In addition, we searched for 
      pathogenic STUB1 variants in probands with expanded alleles of TBP(>49) (n = 2) 
      or intermediate alleles of TBP(>/=40) (n = 47). RESULTS: STUB1 variants were found 
      in half of the TBP(40-49) cohort. Mirroring this finding, TBP(40-49) alleles were 
      detected in 40% of STUB1 probands. The longer the TBP repeat length, the more 
      likely the occurrence of cognitive impairment (P = .0129) and the faster the 
      disease progression until death (P = .0003). Importantly, 13 STUB1 probands 
      presenting with the full SCA48 clinical phenotype had normal TBP(37-39) alleles, 
      excluding digenic inheritance as the sole mode. CONCLUSION: We show that 
      intermediate TBP(40-49) alleles act as disease modifiers of SCA48 rather than a 
      STUB1/TBP digenic model. This distinction from what has been proposed before has 
      crucial consequences for genetic counseling in SCA48.

TI  - Clinical and Molecular Findings of Intermediate Allele Carriers in the HTT Gene 
      from the Mexican Mestizo Population.
PG  - 34-42
LID - 10.1159/000526260 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: There are reports of different clinical statuses in carriers of 
      intermediate alleles (IAs) of CAG trinucleotide repeats in the HTT gene, from 
      individuals affected by a clinical picture indistinguishable from Huntington's 
      disease (HD) to those without manifestations. Therefore, the possible clinical 
      significance of these alleles has been widely debated. OBJECTIVES: The aim of 
      this study was to describe general and clinical features and discard HD 
      phenocopies by molecular assessment in a case series of IA carriers on the HTT 
      gene of a laboratory sample from a neurological center in Mexico. METHODS: We 
      selected individuals who had previously been tested for the HTT gene expansion, 
      which resulted in IAs. Clinical information was obtained from medical records, 
      and molecular analysis of the JPH3, PRNP, and TBP genes was performed only in IA 
      carriers with clinical manifestations. In addition, two patients with IA and 
      acanthocytes were evaluated by whole-exome sequencing. The scientific and ethical 
      committees of the National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery Manuel Velasco 
      Suarez (NINNMVS) approved this study. RESULTS: From 1994 to 2019, the Genetics 
      Department of the NINNMVS confirmed 34 individuals with IAs, 15 of whom belonged 
      to 11 families with HD (IA-HD) and 19 of whom had no family history of HD 
      (IA-non-HD). We found a high proportion of manifestations of the HD phenotypic 
      spectrum in the IA-non-HD subgroup. In addition, among the 20 samples of IA 
      carriers with manifestations molecularly evaluated, we identified two unrelated 
      subjects with CAG/CTG repeat expansions on the JPH3 gene, confirming HD-like 2 
      (HDL2), and one patient with the homozygous pathogenic c.3232G>T variant 
      (p.Glu1078Ter) in the VPS13A gene, demonstrating choreoacanthocytosis. 
      DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Our results show the most extensive series of subjects 
      with IAs and clinical manifestations. In addition, we identify three HD 
      phenocopies, two HDL2 cases, and one choreoacanthocytosis case. Therefore, we 
      emphasize evaluating other HD phenocopies in IA carriers with clinical 
      manifestations whose family background is not associated with HD.

TI  - Variation in TAF1 expression in female carrier induced pluripotent stem cells and 
      human brain ontogeny has implications for adult neostriatum vulnerability in 
      X-linked Dystonia Parkinsonism.
LID - ENEURO.0129-22.2022 [pii]
LID - 10.1523/ENEURO.0129-22.2022 [doi]
AB  - X-linked Dystonia-Parkinsonism (XDP) is an inherited, X-linked, adult-onset 
      movement disorder characterized by degeneration in the neostriatum. No 
      therapeutics alter disease progression. The mechanisms underlying regional 
      differences in degeneration and adult onset are unknown. Developing therapeutics 
      requires a deeper understanding of how XDP-relevant features vary in health and 
      disease. XDP is possibly due, in part, to a partial loss of TAF1 function. A 
      disease-specific SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) retrotransposon insertion occurs within 
      intron 32 of TAF1, a subunit of TFIID involved in transcription initiation. While 
      all XDP males are usually clinically affected, females are heterozygous carriers 
      generally not manifesting the full syndrome. As a resource for disease modeling, 
      we characterized eight iPSC lines from three XDP female carrier individuals for X 
      chromosome inactivation status and identified clonal lines that express either 
      the wild-type X or XDP haplotype. Furthermore, we characterized XDP-relevant 
      transcript expression in neurotypical humans, and found that SVA-F expression 
      decreases after 30 years of age in the brain and that TAF1 is decreased in most 
      female samples. Uniquely in the caudate nucleus, TAF1 expression is not sexually 
      dimorphic and decreased after adolescence. These findings indicate that 
      regional-, age- and sex-specific mechanisms regulate TAF1, highlighting the 
      importance of disease-relevant models and postmortem tissue. We propose that the 
      decreased TAF1 expression in the adult caudate may synergize with the 
      XDP-specific partial loss of TAF1 function in patients, thereby passing a minimum 
      threshold of TAF1 function, and triggering degeneration in the 
      neostriatum.Significance StatementXDP is an inherited, X-linked, adult-onset 
      movement disorder characterized by degeneration in the neostriatum. No 
      therapeutics alter disease progression. Developing therapeutics requires a deeper 
      understanding of how XDP-relevant features vary in health and disease. XDP is 
      possibly due to a partial loss of TAF1 function. While all XDP males are usually 
      affected, females are heterozygous carriers generally not manifesting the full 
      syndrome. As a resource for disease modeling, we characterized eight stem cell 
      lines from XDP female carrier individuals. Furthermore, we found that, uniquely 
      in the caudate nucleus, TAF1 expression decreases after adolescence in healthy 
      humans. We hypothesize that the decrease of TAF1 after adolescence in human 
      caudate, in general, may underlie the vulnerability of the adult neostriatum in 
      XDP.

TI  - A Severe Dementia Syndrome Caused by Intron Retention and Cryptic Splice Site 
      Activation in STUB1 and Exacerbated by TBP Repeat Expansions.

AB  - Heterozygous pathogenic variants in the STIP1 homologous and U-box containing 
      protein 1 (STUB1) gene have been identified as causes of autosomal dominant 
      inherited spinocerebellar ataxia type 48 (SCA48). SCA48 is characterized by an 
      ataxic movement disorder that is often, but not always, accompanied by a 
      cognitive affective syndrome. We report a severe early onset dementia syndrome 
      that mimics frontotemporal dementia and is caused by the intronic splice donor 
      variant c.524+1G>A in STUB1. Impaired splicing was demonstrated by RNA analysis 
      and in minigene assays of mutated and wild-type constructs of STUB1. The most 
      striking consequence of this splicing impairment was retention of intron 3 in 
      STUB1, which led to an in-frame insertion of 63 amino acids (aa) 
      (p.Arg175_Glu176ins63) into the highly conserved coiled-coil domain of its 
      encoded protein, C-terminus of HSP70-interacting protein (CHIP). To a lesser 
      extent, activation of two cryptic splice sites in intron 3 was observed. The 
      almost exclusively used one, c.524+86, was not predicted by in silico programs. 
      Variant c.524+86 caused a frameshift (p.Arg175fs*93) that resulted in a truncated 
      protein and presumably impairs the C-terminal U-box of CHIP, which normally 
      functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The cryptic splice site c.524+99 was rarely 
      used and led to an in-frame insertion of 33 aa (p.Arg175_Glu176ins33) that 
      resulted in disruption of the coiled-coil domain, as has been previously 
      postulated for complete intron 3 retention. We additionally detected repeat 
      expansions in the range of reduced penetrance in the TATA box-binding protein 
      (TBP) gene by excluding other genes associated with dementia syndromes. The 
      repeat expansion was heterozygous in one patient but compound heterozygous in the 
      more severely affected patient. Therefore, we concluded that the observed severe 
      dementia syndrome has a digenic background, making STUB1 and TBP important 
      candidate genes responsible for early onset dementia syndromes.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a 
      polyglutamine-encoding trinucleotide repeat expansion in the gene of 
      transcription factor TATA box-binding protein (TBP). While its underlying 
      pathomechanism is elusive, polyglutamine-expanded TBP fragments of unknown origin 
      mediate the mutant protein's toxicity. Calcium-dependent calpain proteases are 
      protagonists in neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we demonstrate that calpains 
      cleave TBP, and emerging C-terminal fragments mislocalize to the cytoplasm. SCA17 
      cell and rat models exhibited calpain overactivation, leading to excessive 
      fragmentation and depletion of neuronal proteins in vivo. Transcriptome analysis 
      of SCA17 cells revealed synaptogenesis and calcium signaling perturbations, 
      indicating the potential cause of elevated calpain activity. Pharmacological or 
      genetic calpain inhibition reduced TBP cleavage and aggregation, consequently 
      improving cell viability. Our work underlines the general significance of 
      calpains and their activating pathways in neurodegenerative disorders and 
      presents these proteases as novel players in the molecular pathogenesis of SCA17.

TI  - Whole genome sequencing for the diagnosis of neurological repeat expansion 
      disorders in the UK: a retrospective diagnostic accuracy and prospective clinical 
      validation study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Repeat expansion disorders affect about 1 in 3000 individuals and are 
      clinically heterogeneous diseases caused by expansions of short tandem DNA 
      repeats. Genetic testing is often locus-specific, resulting in underdiagnosis of 
      people who have atypical clinical presentations, especially in paediatric 
      patients without a previous positive family history. Whole genome sequencing is 
      increasingly used as a first-line test for other rare genetic disorders, and we 
      aimed to assess its performance in the diagnosis of patients with neurological 
      repeat expansion disorders. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed the diagnostic 
      accuracy of whole genome sequencing to detect the most common repeat expansion 
      loci associated with neurological outcomes (AR, ATN1, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, 
      C9orf72, CACNA1A, DMPK, FMR1, FXN, HTT, and TBP) using samples obtained within 
      the National Health Service in England from patients who were suspected of having 
      neurological disorders; previous PCR test results were used as the reference 
      standard. The clinical accuracy of whole genome sequencing to detect repeat 
      expansions was prospectively examined in previously genetically tested and 
      undiagnosed patients recruited in 2013-17 to the 100 000 Genomes Project in the 
      UK, who were suspected of having a genetic neurological disorder (familial or 
      early-onset forms of ataxia, neuropathy, spastic paraplegia, dementia, motor 
      neuron disease, parkinsonian movement disorders, intellectual disability, or 
      neuromuscular disorders). If a repeat expansion call was made using whole genome 
      sequencing, PCR was used to confirm the result. FINDINGS: The diagnostic accuracy 
      of whole genome sequencing to detect repeat expansions was evaluated against 793 
      PCR tests previously performed within the NHS from 404 patients. Whole genome 
      sequencing correctly classified 215 of 221 expanded alleles and 1316 of 1321 
      non-expanded alleles, showing 97.3% sensitivity (95% CI 94.2-99.0) and 99.6% 
      specificity (99.1-99.9) across the 13 disease-associated loci when compared with 
      PCR test results. In samples from 11 631 patients in the 100 000 Genomes Project, 
      whole genome sequencing identified 81 repeat expansions, which were also tested 
      by PCR: 68 were confirmed as repeat expansions in the full pathogenic range, 11 
      were non-pathogenic intermediate expansions or premutations, and two were 
      non-expanded repeats (16% false discovery rate). INTERPRETATION: In our study, 
      whole genome sequencing for the detection of repeat expansions showed high 
      sensitivity and specificity, and it led to identification of neurological repeat 
      expansion disorders in previously undiagnosed patients. These findings support 
      implementation of whole genome sequencing in clinical laboratories for diagnosis 
      of patients who have a neurological presentation consistent with a repeat 
      expansion disorder. FUNDING: Medical Research Council, Department of Health and

TI  - Digenic inheritance of STUB1 variants and TBP polyglutamine expansions explains 
      the incomplete penetrance of SCA17 and SCA48.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to unravel the genetic factors underlying missing 
      heritability in spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17) caused by 
      polyglutamine-encoding CAG/CAA repeat expansions in the TBP gene. Alleles with 
      >49 CAG/CAA repeats are fully penetrant. Most patients, however, carry 
      intermediate TBP(41-49) alleles that show incomplete penetrance. METHODS: Using 
      next-generation sequencing approaches, we investigated 40 SCA17/TBP(41-54) index 
      patients, their affected (n = 55) and unaffected (n = 51) relatives, and a cohort 
      of patients with ataxia (n = 292). RESULTS: All except 1 (30/31) of the index 
      cases with TBP(41-46) alleles carried a heterozygous pathogenic variant in the 
      STUB1 gene associated with spinocerebellar ataxias SCAR16 (autosomal recessive) 
      and SCA48 (autosomal dominant). No STUB1 variant was found in patients carrying 
      TBP(47-54) alleles. TBP(41-46) expansions and STUB1 variants cosegregate in all 
      affected family members, whereas the presence of either TBP(41-46) expansions or 
      STUB1 variants individually was never associated with the disease. CONCLUSION: 
      Our data reveal an unexpected genetic interaction between STUB1 and TBP in the 
      pathogenesis of SCA17 and raise questions on the existence of SCA48 as a 
      monogenic disease with crucial implications for diagnosis and counseling. They 
      provide a convincing explanation for the incomplete penetrance of intermediate 
      TBP alleles and demonstrate a dual inheritance pattern for SCA17, which is a 
      monogenic dominant disorder for TBP(>/=47) alleles and a digenic TBP/STUB1 disease 
      (SCA17-DI) for intermediate expansions.

TI  - Molecular epidemiology of hereditary ataxia in Finland.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The genetics of cerebellar ataxia is complex. Hundreds of causative 
      genes have been identified, but only a few cause more than single cases. The 
      spectrum of ataxia-causing genes differs considerably between populations. The 
      aim of the study was to investigate the molecular epidemiology of ataxia in the 
      Finnish population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients in hospital database were 
      reviewed for the diagnosis of unspecified ataxia. Acquired ataxias and nongenetic 
      ataxias such as those related to infection, trauma or stroke were excluded. Sixty 
      patients with sporadic ataxia with unknown etiology and 36 patients with familial 
      ataxia of unknown etiology were recruited in the study. Repeat expansions in the 
      SCA genes (ATXN1, 2, 3, 7, 8/OS, CACNA1A, TBP), FXN, and RFC1 were determined. 
      Point mutations in POLG, SPG7 and in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were investigated. 
      In addition, DNA from 8 patients was exome sequenced. RESULTS: A genetic cause of 
      ataxia was found in 33 patients (34.4%). Seven patients had a dominantly 
      inherited repeat expansion in ATXN8/OS. Ten patients had mitochondrial ataxia 
      resulting from mutations in nuclear mitochondrial genes POLG or RARS2, or from a 
      point mutation m.8561C > G or a single deletion in mtDNA. Interestingly, five 
      patients were biallelic for the recently identified pathogenic repeat expansion 
      in RFC1. All the five patients presented with the phenotype of cerebellar ataxia, 
      neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia (CANVAS). Moreover, screening of 54 patients 
      with Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy revealed four additional patients with 
      biallelic repeat expansion in RFC1, but none of them had cerebellar symptoms. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Expansion in ATXN8/OS results in the majority of dominant ataxias in 
      Finland, while mutations in RFC1 and POLG are the most common cause of recessive 
      ataxias. Our results suggest that analysis of RFC1 should be included in the 
      routine diagnostics of idiopathic ataxia and Charcot-Marie-Tooth polyneuropathy.

AB  - PURPOSE: Investigate single nucleotide variants and short tandem repeats in 39 
      genes related to spinocerebellar ataxia in clinical and pathologically defined 
      cohorts of multiple system atrophy. METHODS: Exome sequencing was conducted in 28 
      clinical multiple system atrophy patients to identify single nucleotide variants 
      in spinocerebellar ataxia-related genes. Novel variants were validated in two 
      independent disease cohorts: 86 clinically diagnosed multiple system atrophy 
      patients and 166 pathological multiple system atrophy cases. Expanded repeat 
      alleles in spinocerebellar ataxia genes were evaluated in 36 clinically diagnosed 
      multiple system atrophy patients, and CAG/CAA repeats in TATA-Box Binding Protein 
      (TBP, causative of SCA17) were screened in 216 clinical and pathological multiple 
      system atrophy patients and 346 controls. RESULTS: No known pathogenic 
      spinocerebellar ataxia single nucleotide variants or pathogenic range expanded 
      repeat alleles of ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, AXTN7, ATXN8OS, ATXN10, PPP2R2B, 
      and TBP were detected in any clinical multiple system atrophy patients. However, 
      four novel variants were identified in four spinocerebellar ataxia-related genes 
      across three multiple system atrophy patients. Additionally, four multiple system 
      atrophy patients (1.6%) and one control (0.3%) carried an intermediate length 41 
      TBP CAG/CAA repeat allele (OR = 4.11, P = 0.21). There was a significant 
      association between the occurrence of a repeat length of longer alleles (> 38 
      repeats) and an increased risk of multiple system atrophy (OR = 1.64, P = 0.03). 
      CONCLUSION: Occurrence of TBP CAG/CAA repeat length of longer alleles (> 38 
      repeats) is significantly associated with increased multiple system atrophy risk. 
      This discovery warrants further investigation and supports a possible genetic 
      overlap of multiple system atrophy with SCA17.

TI  - Investigating TBP CAG/CAA trinucleotide repeat expansions in a Taiwanese cohort

AB  - Intermediate-length CAG repeats in ATXN2 have been well recognized as a genetic 
      risk factor for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, the role of similar 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions in the TATA-box binding protein gene (TBP), 
      another disease-associated gene for inherited ataxia, in ALS remains elusive. To 
      assess the association between TBP trinucleotide repeat expansions and ALS, we 
      investigated the repeat lengths in 325 unrelated ALS patients and 1500 controls 
      in the Taiwanese population. The most common size of repeats in the patients and 
      controls were both 36. The repeat lengths ranged from 29 to 46 repeats in the ALS 
      patients and 27 to 43 repeats in the controls. Two ALS patients carried a TBP 
      allele with a repeat number equal or greater than 44 (44 and 46). The patient 
      with the 46 trinucleotide repeats also had a C9ORF72 GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat 
      expansion. The odds ratio of an individual carrying the CAG/CAA repeats >/= 44 to 
      have ALS is 23.2 (95% confidence interval: 1.11-484.24; p = 0.04). Our findings 
      suggest that intermediate-length CAG/CAA repeat expansions in TBP may associate 
      with ALS risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The diagnostic workup for choreiform movement disorders including 
      Huntington's disease (HD) and those mimicking HD like phenotype is complex. 
      OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to genetically define HD and HD-like 
      presentations in an Indian cohort. We also describe HTT-CAG expansion manifesting 
      as neuroferritinopathy-like disorder in four families from Punjab in India. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: 159 patients clinically diagnosed as HD and HD-like 
      presentations from various tertiary neurology clinics were referred to our centre 
      (CSIR-IGIB) for genetic investigations. As a first tier test, CAG-TNR for HTT was 
      performed and subsequently HD-negative samples were screened for JPH3 (HDL2), TBP 
      (SCA17), ATN1 (DRPLA), PPP2R2B (SCA12) and GGGGCC expansion in C9orf72 gene. Four 
      families presenting as neuroferritinopathy-like disorder were also investigated 
      for HTT-CAG expansion. RESULTS: 94 of 159 (59%) patients were found to have 
      expanded HTT-CAG repeats. Pathogenic repeat expansion in JPH3, TBP, ATN1 and 
      C9orf72 were not found in HD negative cases. Two patients were positive for 
      SCA12-CAG expansion in pathogenic length, whereas 5 cases harboured TBP-CAG 
      repeats falling in reduced penetrance range of 41- 48 repeats for SCA17. Four 
      unrelated families, presented with atypical chorea and brain MRI findings 
      suggestive of basal ganglia abnormalities mimicking neuroferritinopathy were 
      found to harbour HTT-CAG expansion. CONCLUSION: We present SCA12 as a new 
      reported phenocopy of HD which should be considered for diagnostic workout along 
      with SCA17 for HD-like syndromes. This study also illustrates the necessity, to 
      consider evolving HD like phenotype, as a clinical diagnosis for cases with 
      initial manifestations depicting neuroferritinopathy.

TI  - Pathogenic SREK1 decrease in Huntington's disease lowers TAF1 mimicking X-linked 
      dystonia parkinsonism.
PG  - 2207-2219
LID - 10.1093/brain/awaa150 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease and X-linked dystonia parkinsonism are two monogenic basal 
      ganglia model diseases. Huntington's disease is caused by a 
      polyglutamine-encoding CAG repeat expansion in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene leading 
      to several toxic interactions of both the expanded CAG-containing mRNA and the 
      polyglutamine-containing protein, while X-linked dystonia parkinsonism is caused 
      by a retrotransposon insertion in the TAF1 gene, which decreases expression of 
      this core scaffold of the basal transcription factor complex TFIID. SRSF6 is an 
      RNA-binding protein of the serine and arginine-rich (SR) protein family that 
      interacts with expanded CAG mRNA and is sequestered into the characteristic 
      polyglutamine-containing inclusion bodies of Huntington's disease brains. Here we 
      report decreased levels of the SRSF6 interactor and regulator SREK1-another SR 
      protein involved in RNA processing-which includes TAF1 as one of its targets. 
      This led us to hypothesize that Huntington's disease and X-linked dystonia 
      parkinsonism pathogeneses converge in TAF1 alteration. We show that diminishing 
      SRSF6 through RNA interference in human neuroblastoma cells leads to a decrease 
      in SREK1 levels, which, in turn, suffices to cause diminished TAF1 levels. We 
      also observed decreased SREK1 and TAF1 levels in striatum of Huntington's disease 
      patients and transgenic model mice. We then generated mice with neuronal 
      transgenic expression of SREK1 (TgSREK1 mice) that, interestingly, showed 
      transcriptomic alterations complementary to those in Huntington's disease mice. 
      Most importantly, by combining Huntington's disease and TgSREK1 mice we verify 
      that SREK1 overexpression corrects TAF1 deficiency and attenuates striatal 
      atrophy and motor phenotype of Huntington's disease mice. Our results therefore 
      demonstrate that altered RNA processing upon SREK1 dysregulation plays a key role 
      in Huntington's disease pathogenesis and pinpoint TAF1 as a likely general 
      determinant of selective vulnerability of the striatum in multiple neurological 
      disorders.

AB  - Expansions of amino acid repeats occur in >20 inherited human disorders, and many 
      occur in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of transcription factors (TFs). 
      Such diseases are associated with protein aggregation, but the contribution of 
      aggregates to pathology has been controversial. Here, we report that alanine 
      repeat expansions in the HOXD13 TF, which cause hereditary synpolydactyly in 
      humans, alter its phase separation capacity and its capacity to co-condense with 
      transcriptional co-activators. HOXD13 repeat expansions perturb the composition 
      of HOXD13-containing condensates in vitro and in vivo and alter the 
      transcriptional program in a cell-specific manner in a mouse model of 
      synpolydactyly. Disease-associated repeat expansions in other TFs (HOXA13, RUNX2, 
      and TBP) were similarly found to alter their phase separation. These results 
      suggest that unblending of transcriptional condensates may underlie human 
      pathologies. We present a molecular classification of TF IDRs, which provides a 
      framework to dissect TF function in diseases associated with transcriptional 
      dysregulation.

AB  - In many repeat diseases, such as Huntington's disease (HD), ongoing repeat 
      expansions in affected tissues contribute to disease onset, progression and 
      severity. Inducing contractions of expanded repeats by exogenous agents is not 
      yet possible. Traditional approaches would target proteins driving repeat 
      mutations. Here we report a compound, naphthyridine-azaquinolone (NA), that 
      specifically binds slipped-CAG DNA intermediates of expansion mutations, a 
      previously unsuspected target. NA efficiently induces repeat contractions in HD 
      patient cells as well as en masse contractions in medium spiny neurons of HD 
      mouse striatum. Contractions are specific for the expanded allele, independently 
      of DNA replication, require transcription across the coding CTG strand and arise 
      by blocking repair of CAG slip-outs. NA-induced contractions depend on active 
      expansions driven by MutSbeta. NA injections in HD mouse striatum reduce mutant HTT 
      protein aggregates, a biomarker of HD pathogenesis and severity. 
      Repeat-structure-specific DNA ligands are a novel avenue to contract expanded 
      repeats.

TI  - Frequency and distribution of polyQ disease intermediate-length repeat alleles in 
      healthy Italian population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) and spinocerebellar ataxia type 1-2-17 
      (SCA1-2-17) are adult-onset autosomal dominant diseases, caused by triplet repeat 
      expansions in the HTT, ATXN1, ATXN2, and TBP genes. Alleles with a repeat number 
      just below the pathological threshold are associated with reduced penetrance and 
      meiotic instability and are defined as intermediate alleles (IAs). OBJECTIVES: We 
      aimed to determine the frequencies of IAs in healthy Italian subjects and to 
      compare the proportion of the IAs with the prevalence of the respective diseases. 
      METHODS: We analyzed the triplet repeat size in HTT, ATXN1, ATXN2, and TBP genes 
      in the DNA samples from 729 consecutive adult healthy Italian subjects. RESULTS: 
      IAs associated with reduced penetrance were found in ATXN2 gene (1 subject, 0.1%) 
      and TBP gene (0.82%). IAs at risk for meiotic instability were found in HTT 
      (5.3%) and ATXN2 genes (2.7%). In ATXN1, we found a low percentage of IAs (0.4%). 
      Alleles lacking the common CAT interruption within the CAG sequence were also 
      rare (0.3%). CONCLUSIONS: The high frequencies of IAs in HTT and ATXN2 genes 
      suggest a correlation with the prevalence of the diseases in our population and 
      support the hypothesis that IAs could represent a reservoir of new pathological 
      expansions. On the opposite, ATXN1-IA were very rare in respect to the prevalence 
      of SCA1 in our country, and TBP- IA were more frequent than expected, suggesting 
      that other mechanisms could influence the occurrence of novel pathological 
      expansions.

AB  - Polyglutamine diseases are neurodegenerative diseases that occur due to the 
      expansion of CAG repeat regions in coding sequences of genes. Previously, we have 
      shown the formation of large protein aggregates along with activation of the 
      interferon pathway leading to apoptosis in a cellular model of SCA17. Here, we 
      corroborate our previous results in a tetracycline-inducible model of SCA17. 
      Interferon gamma and lambda were upregulated in 59Q-TBP expressing cells as 
      compared to 16Q-TBP expressing cells. Besides interferon-stimulated genes, the 
      SCA17 model and Huntington's mice brain samples showed upregulation of RNA 
      sensors. However, in this improved model interferon pathway activation and 
      apoptosis preceded the formation of large polyglutamine aggregates, suggesting a 
      role for CAG repeat RNA or soluble protein aggregates. A polyglutamine minus 
      mutant of TBP, expressing polyCAG mRNA, was created by site directed mutagenesis 
      of 10 potential start codons. Neither this long CAG embedded mRNA nor short 
      polyCAG RNA could induce interferon pathway genes or cause apoptosis. polyQ-TBP 
      induced the expression of canonical RNA sensors but the downstream transcription 
      factor, IRF3, showed a muted response. We found that expanded CAG repeat RNA is 
      not sufficient to account for the neuronal apoptosis. Neuronal cells sense 
      expanded CAG repeats embedded in messenger RNAs of protein-coding genes. However, 
      polyglutamine containing protein is responsible for the interferon-mediated 
      neuroinflammation and cell death seen in polyglutamine disease. Thus, we 
      delineate the inflammatory role of CAG repeats in the mRNA from the resulting 
      polyglutamine tract in the protein. Embedded in messenger RNAs of protein-coding 
      regions, the cell senses CAG repeat expansion and induces the expression of RNA 
      sensors and interferon-stimulated genes.

AB  - Although the heritability of cognitive function in old age is substantial, 
      genome-wide association studies have had limited success in elucidating its 
      genetic basis, leaving a considerable amount of "missing heritability." Aside 
      from single nucleotide polymorphisms, genome-wide association studies are unable 
      to assess other large sources of genetic variation, such as tandem repeat 
      polymorphisms. Therefore, here, we studied the association of 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat variations in polyglutamine 
      disease-associated genes (PDAGs) with cognitive function in older adults. In a 
      large cohort consisting of 5786 participants, we found that the CAG repeat number 
      in 3 PDAGs (TBP, HTT, and AR) were significantly associated with the decline in 
      cognitive function, which together accounted for 0.49% of the variation. 
      Furthermore, in an magnetic resonance imaging substudy, we found that CAG repeat 
      polymorphisms in 4 PDAGs (ATXN2, CACNA1A, ATXN7, and AR) were associated with 
      different imaging characteristics, including brain stem, putamen, globus 
      pallidus, thalamus, and amygdala volumes. Our findings indicate that tandem 
      repeat polymorphisms are associated with cognitive function in older adults and 
      highlight the importance of PDAGs in elucidating its missing heritability.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The presence of more than one polyQ-related gene within a single 
      individual is a rare incidence, which may provide the potential opportunity to 
      study the combined effects of these spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) genes. METHODS: 
      We retrospectively analyzed genetic data from 112 SCA3 probands and found Patient 
      1 harbored expanded ATXN2 allele (33 repeats) and intermediate TBP allele (41 
      repeats), and Patient 2 with intermediate ATXN2 allele (32 repeats). Detailed 
      clinical and oculomotor performances were investigated. The age at onset and 
      oculomotor parameters of both patients were compared with matched pure SCA3 
      groups controlling either disease severity or CAG repeats. RESULTS: Most of the 
      clinical phenotypes and oculomotor characteristics of these two patients were 
      common to typical SCA3 patients. Compared to pure SCA3 groups controlling disease 
      severity, mild reduced horizontal saccade velocity could be detected in both 
      patients. However, mild expansions of the ATXN2 allele seemed to have no 
      influence on the age at onset of Patient 1 but might have a mild impact on 
      Patient 2. CONCLUSION: Our study provides supporting evidence that mild 
      expansions of ATXN2 may have modifying effects on SCA3 phenotype. Larger control 
      series and longitudinal data are warranted to confirm our results.

PG  - 654-658
LID - 10.1007/s12311-018-0998-2 [doi]
AB  - SCA 17 is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder caused by TBP gene CAG/CAA repeat 
      expansion. Ataxia and dementia are common. The presence of frontal dysfunction at 
      outset of the disease may mimic frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Parkinsonism, 
      chorea, dystonia, and pyramidal signs may occur. We report an Irish family with 
      autosomal dominant partially penetrant frontal dementia with cerebellar atrophy 
      due to SCA17 and present detailed neuropsychological assessment for the first 
      time. A 44-year-old doctor presented with 18-month history of behavioral 
      problems. She slowed down, became apathetic, and unable to multitask. She became 
      more irritable and short tempered, and her work performance deteriorated. Brain 
      MRI showed cerebellar atrophy and cerebellar hypometabolism was noted on FDG-PET. 
      A sister developed personality changes at age 45 with apathy, and had problems 
      with memory and social skills; another sister at age 39 became dysarthric and 
      unsteady. A brother at age 52 demonstrated emotional lability, and became 
      dysarthric, unsteady, and slowed down. Their mother aged 73 had an abnormal 
      antalgic gait due to arthritis; their father was jocular and disinhibited. MAPT 
      testing detected an exon 9 c.726C>T variant in the proband. Subsequent testing in 
      nine siblings and both parents failed to show co-segregation with disease. SCA17 
      testing revealed a TBP gene 43 repeat expansion that co-segregated in all 
      affected siblings and in the mother whose gait problems were initially attributed 
      to arthritis. In over 80% of cases of FTD with clear autosomal dominant 
      inheritance, causative gene defects involve MAPT, GRN, or C9orf72 mutations. A 
      minority involves VCP, FUS, and CHMP2B. As evident from our case, SCA17 testing 
      should also be considered, especially if cerebellar atrophy if found on imaging. 
      Segregation analysis is crucial. MAPT variant (c.726C>T exon 9) detected in the 
      family was deemed a polymorphism.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17) is a rare autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the TATA-box 
      binding protein gene (TBP). The disease has a varied age at onset and clinical 
      presentation. It is distinct from other SCAs for its association with dementia, 
      psychiatric symptoms, and some patients presenting with chorea. For this reason, 
      it is also called Huntington's disease-like 4 (HDL-4). Here we examine the 
      distribution of SCA17 allele repeat sizes in a United Kingdom-based cohort with 
      ataxia and find that fully penetrant pathogenic alleles are very rare (5 in 1,316 
      chromosomes; 0.38%). Phenotype-genotype correlation was performed on 30 
      individuals and the repeat structure of their TBP genes was examined. We found a 
      negative linear correlation between total CAG repeat length and age at disease 
      onset and, unlike SCA1, there was no correlation between the longest contiguous 
      CAG tract and age at disease onset. We were unable to identify any particular 
      phenotypic trait that segregated with particular CAG/CAA repeat tract structures 
      or repeat lengths. One individual within the cohort was homozygous for variable 
      penetrance range SCA17 alleles. This patient had a similar age at onset to 
      heterozygotes with the same repeat sizes, but also presented with a rapidly 
      progressive dementia. A pair of monozygotic twins within the cohort presented 3 
      years apart with the sibling with the earlier onset having a more severe 
      phenotype with dementia and chorea in addition to the ataxia observed in their 
      twin. This appears to be a case of variable expressivity, possibly influenced by 
      other environmental or epigenetic factors. Finally, there was an asymptomatic 
      father with a severely affected child with an age at onset in their twenties. 
      Despite this, they share the same expanded allele repeat sizes and sequences, 
      which would suggest that there is marked difference in the penetrance of this 
      51-repeat allele. We therefore propose that the variable penetrance range extend 
      from 48 repeats to incorporate this allele. This study shows that there is 
      variability in the presentation and penetrance of the SCA17 phenotype and 
      highlights the complexity of this disorder.

AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, characterised 
      by a triad of movement disorder, emotional and behavioural disturbances and 
      cognitive impairment. The underlying cause is an expanded CAG repeat in the 
      huntingtin gene. For a small proportion of patients presenting with HD-like 
      symptoms, the mutation in this gene is not identified and they are said to have a 
      HD "phenocopy". South Africa has the highest number of recorded cases of an 
      African-specific phenocopy, Huntington disease-like 2 (HDL2), caused by a repeat 
      expansion in the junctophilin-3 gene. However, a significant proportion of black 
      patients with clinical symptoms suggestive of HD still test negative for HD and 
      HDL2. This study thus aimed to investigate five other loci associated with HD 
      phenocopy syndromes - ATN1, ATXN2, ATXN7, TBP and C9orf72. In a sample of 
      patients in whom HD and HDL2 had been excluded, a single expansion was identified 
      in the ATXN2 gene, confirming a diagnosis of Spinocerebellar ataxia 2. The 
      results indicate that common repeat expansion disorders do not contribute 
      significantly to the HD-like phenotype in black South African patients. 
      Importantly, allele sizing reveals unique distributions of normal repeat lengths 
      across the associated loci in the African population studied.

AB  - Cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat expansions in the coding regions of nine 
      polyglutamine (polyQ) genes (HTT, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, ATN1, AR, 
      and TBP) are the cause of several neurodegenerative diseases including 
      Huntington's disease (HD), six different spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, and spinobulbar muscular atrophy. The 
      expanded CAG repeat length in the causative gene is negatively related to the 
      age-at-onset (AAO) of clinical symptoms. In addition to the expanded CAG repeat 
      length in the causative gene, the normal CAG repeats in the other polyQ genes can 
      affect the AAO, suggesting functional interactions between the polyQ genes. 
      However, there is no detailed assessment of the relationships among polyQ genes 
      in pathologically relevant brain regions. We used gene co-expression analysis to 
      study the functional relationships among polyQ genes in different brain regions 
      using the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA), a spatial map of gene expression in the 
      healthy brain. We constructed co-expression networks for seven anatomical brain 
      structures, as well as a region showing a specific pattern of atrophy in HD 
      patients detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. In this 
      HD-associated region, we found that ATN1 and ATXN2 were co-expressed and shared 
      co-expression partners which were enriched for DNA repair genes. We observed a 
      similar co-expression pattern in the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, and striatum in 
      which this relation was most pronounced. Given that the co-expression patterns 
      for these anatomical structures were similar to those for the HD-associated 
      region, our results suggest that their disruption is likely involved in HD 
      pathology. Moreover, ATN1 and ATXN2 also shared many co-expressed genes with HTT, 
      the causative gene of HD, across the brain. Although this triangular relationship 
      among these three polyQ genes may also be dysregulated in other polyQ diseases, 
      stronger co-expression patterns between ATN1 and ATXN2 observed in the 
      HD-associated region, especially in the striatum, may be more specific to HD.

TI  - Postural Tremor and Ataxia Progression in Spinocerebellar Ataxias.
PG  - 492

LID - 492
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postural tremor can sometimes occur in spinocerebellar ataxias 
      (SCAs). However, the prevalence and clinical characteristics of postural tremor 
      in SCAs are poorly understood, and whether SCA patients with postural tremor have 
      different ataxia progression is not known. METHODS: We studied postural tremor in 
      315 patients with SCA1, 2, 3, and 6 recruited from the Clinical Research 
      Consortium for Spinocerebellar Ataxias (CRC-SCA), which consists of 12 
      participating centers in the United States, and we evaluated ataxia progression 
      in these patients from January 2010 to August 2012. RESULTS: Among 315 SCA 
      patients, postural tremor was most common in SCA2 patients (SCA1, 5.8%; SCA2, 
      27.5%; SCA3, 12.4%; SCA6, 16.9%; p = 0.007). SCA3 patients with postural tremor 
      had longer CAG repeat expansions than SCA3 patients without postural tremor 
      (73.67 +/- 3.12 vs. 70.42 +/- 3.96, p = 0.003). Interestingly, SCA1 and SCA6 patients 
      with postural tremor had a slower rate of ataxia progression (SCA1, beta = -0.91, p 
      < 0.001; SCA6, beta = -1.28, p = 0.025), while SCA2 patients with postural tremor 
      had a faster rate of ataxia progression (beta = 1.54, p = 0.034). We also found that 
      the presence of postural tremor in SCA2 patients could be influenced by repeat 
      expansions of ATXN1 (beta = -1.53, p = 0.037) and ATXN3 (beta = 0.57, p = 0.018), 
      whereas postural tremor in SCA3 was associated with repeat lengths in TBP (beta = 
      0.63, p = 0.041) and PPP2R2B (beta = -0.40, p = 0.032). DISCUSSION: Postural tremor 
      could be a clinical feature of SCAs, and the presence of postural tremor could be 
      associated with different rates of ataxia progression. Genetic interactions 
      between ataxia genes might influence the brain circuitry and thus affect the 
      clinical presentation of postural tremor.

TI  - Synergistic Toxicity of Polyglutamine-Expanded TATA-Binding Protein in Glia and 
      Neuronal Cells: Therapeutic Implications for Spinocerebellar Ataxia 17.
PG  - 9101-9115
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0111-17.2017 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 17 (SCA17) is caused by polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat 
      expansion in the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and is among a family of 
      neurodegenerative diseases in which polyQ expansion leads to preferential 
      neuronal loss in the brain. Although previous studies have demonstrated that 
      expression of polyQ-expanded proteins in glial cells can cause neuronal injury 
      via noncell-autonomous mechanisms, these studies investigated animal models that 
      overexpress transgenic mutant proteins. Since glial cells are particularly 
      reactive to overexpressed mutant proteins, it is important to investigate the in 
      vivo role of glial dysfunction in neurodegeneration when mutant polyQ proteins 
      are endogenously expressed. In the current study, we generated two conditional 
      TBP-105Q knock-in mouse models that specifically express mutant TBP at the 
      endogenous level in neurons or in astrocytes. We found that mutant TBP expression 
      in neuronal cells or astrocytes alone only caused mild neurodegeneration, whereas 
      severe neuronal toxicity requires the expression of mutant TBP in both neuronal 
      and glial cells. Coculture of neurons and astrocytes further validated that 
      mutant TBP in astrocytes promoted neuronal injury. We identified activated 
      inflammatory signaling pathways in mutant TBP-expressing astrocytes, and blocking 
      nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling in astrocytes ameliorated neurodegeneration. 
      Our results indicate that the synergistic toxicity of mutant TBP in neuronal and 
      glial cells plays a critical role in SCA17 pathogenesis and that targeting glial 
      inflammation could be a potential therapeutic approach for SCA17 
      treatment.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Mutant TBP with polyglutamine expansion 
      preferentially affects neuronal viability in SCA17 patients. Whether glia, the 
      cells that support and protect neurons, contribute to neurodegeneration in SCA17 
      remains mostly unexplored. In this study, we provide both in vivo and in vitro 
      evidence arguing that endogenous expression of mutant TBP in neurons and glia 
      synergistically impacts neuronal survival. Hyperactivated inflammatory signaling 
      pathways, particularly the NF-kappaB pathway, underlie glia-mediated neurotoxicity. 
      Moreover, blocking NF-kappaB activity with small chemical inhibitors alleviated such 
      neurotoxicity. Our study establishes glial dysfunction as an important component

TI  - A panel study on patients with dominant cerebellar ataxia highlights the 
      frequency of channelopathies.
PG  - 1579-1594

AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias have a marked heterogeneous genetic 
      background, with mutations in 34 genes identified so far. This large amount of 
      implicated genes accounts for heterogeneous clinical presentations, making 
      genotype-phenotype correlations a major challenge in the field. While 
      polyglutamine ataxias, linked to CAG repeat expansions in genes such as ATXN1, 
      ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, CACNA1A and TBP, have been extensively characterized in 
      large cohorts, there is a need for comprehensive assessment of frequency and 
      phenotype of more 'conventional' ataxias. After exclusion of CAG/polyglutamine 
      expansions in spinocerebellar ataxia genes in 412 index cases with dominantly 
      inherited cerebellar ataxias, we aimed to establish the relative frequencies of 
      mutations in other genes, with an approach combining panel sequencing and TaqMan(R) 
      polymerase chain reaction assay. We found relevant genetic variants in 59 
      patients (14.3%). The most frequently mutated were channel genes [CACNA1A (n = 
      16), KCND3 (n = 4), KCNC3 (n = 2) and KCNA1 (n = 2)]. Deletions in ITPR1 (n = 11) 
      were followed by biallelic variants in SPG7 (n = 9). Variants in AFG3L2 (n = 7) 
      came next in frequency, and variants were rarely found in STBN2 (n = 2), ELOVL5, 
      FGF14, STUB1 and TTBK2 (n = 1 each). Interestingly, possible risk factor variants 
      were detected in SPG7 and POLG. Clinical comparisons showed that ataxias due to 
      channelopathies had a significantly earlier age at onset with an average of 24.6 
      years, versus 40.9 years for polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias and 
      37.8 years for SPG7-related forms (P = 0.001). In contrast, disease duration was 
      significantly longer in the former (20.5 years versus 9.3 and 13.7, P=0.001), 
      though for similar functional stages, indicating slower progression of the 
      disease. Of interest, intellectual deficiency was more frequent in channel 
      spinocerebellar ataxias, while cognitive impairment in adulthood was similar 
      among the three groups. Similar differences were found among a single gene group, 
      comparing 23 patients with CACNA1A expansions (spinocerebellar ataxia 6) to 22 
      patients with CACNA1A point mutations, which had lower average age at onset (25.2 
      versus 47.3 years) with longer disease duration (18.7 versus 10.9), but lower 
      severity indexes (0.39 versus 0.44), indicating slower progression of the 
      disease. In conclusion, we identified relevant genetic variations in up to 15% of 
      cases after exclusion of polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias, and 
      confirmed CACNA1A and SPG7 as major ataxia genes. We could delineate firm 
      genotype-phenotype correlations that are important for genetic counselling and of 
      possible prognostic value.

TI  - Dysregulation of gene expression in the striatum of BACHD rats expressing 
      full-length mutant huntingtin and associated abnormalities on molecular and 
      protein levels.
PG  - 260-272
LID - S0028-3908(17)30030-8 [pii]

AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the gene coding for the huntingtin 
      protein (HTT). Mutant HTT (mHTT) has been proposed to cause neuronal dysfunction 
      and neuronal loss through multiple mechanisms. Transcriptional changes may be a 
      core pathogenic feature of HD. Utilizing the Affymetrix platform we performed a 
      genome-wide RNA expression analysis in two BACHD transgenic rat lines (TG5 and 
      TG9) at 12 months of age, both of which carry full-length human mHTT but with 
      different expression levels. By defining the threshold of significance at 
      p < 0.01, we found 1608 genes and 871 genes differentially expressed in both TG5 
      and TG9 rats when compared to the wild type littermates, respectively. We only 
      chose the highly up-/down-regulated genes for further analysis by setting an 
      additional threshold of 1.5 fold change. Comparing gene expression profiles of 
      human HD brains and BACHD rats revealed a high concordance in both functional and 
      IPA (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis) canonical pathways relevant to HD. In addition, 
      we investigated the causes leading to gene expression changes at molecular and 
      protein levels in BACHD rats including the involvement of polyQ-containing 
      transcription factors TATA box-binding protein (TBP), Sp1 and CBP as well as the 
      chromatin structure. We demonstrate that the BACHD rat model recapitulates the 
      gene expression changes of the human disease supporting its role as a preclinical 
      research animal model. We also show for the first time that TFIID complex 
      formation is reduced, while soluble TBP is increased in an HD model. This finding 
      suggests that mHTT is a competitor instead of a recruiter of polyQ-containing 
      transcription factors in the transcription process in HD.

TI  - Expanding the Spectrum of Genes Involved in Huntington Disease Using a Combined 
      Clinical and Genetic Approach.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Huntington disease (HD), a prototypic monogenic disease, is caused by 
      an expanded CAG repeat in the HTT gene exceeding 35 units. However, not all 
      patients with an HD phenotype carry the pathological expansion in HTT, and the 
      positive diagnosis rate is poor. OBJECTIVES: To examine patients with HD 
      phenotypes to determine the frequency of HD phenocopies with typical features of 
      HD but without pathological CAG repeat expansions in HTT in an attempt to improve 
      the positive diagnosis rate. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between January 
      1, 2004, and April 18, 2011, a total of 226 consecutive index patients with an HD 
      phenotype were referred to specialized clinics of the French National Huntington 
      Disease Reference Centre for Rare Diseases. They underwent detailed clinical 
      examination and follow-up, as well as neuropsychological, biological, imaging, 
      and genetic examinations. Nucleotide expansions in JPH3, ATN1, TBP, and C9ORF72 
      and mutations in PRNP, as well as acquired conditions commonly causing HD 
      phenocopies, were first screened. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The diagnostic rate 
      of HD phenocopies and frequency of other etiologies using deep clinical 
      phenotyping and next generation sequencing. Our goal was to improve the genetic 
      diagnosis of HD phenocopies and to identify new HD related genes. RESULTS: One 
      hundred ninety-eight patients carried a pathological CAG repeat expansion in HTT, 
      whereas 28 patients (12 women and 16 men) did not. Huntington disease phenocopies 
      accounted for 12.4%, and their mean (SD) age at onset was similar to those of the 
      HD-HTT group (47.3 [12.7] years vs 50.3 [16.4] years, P = .29). We first 
      identified 3 patients with abnormal CTG expansions in JPH3, a fourth patient with 
      an antiphospholipid syndrome, and a fifth patient with B12 avitaminosis. A 
      custom-made 63-gene panel was generated based on clinical evolution and exome 
      sequencing. It contained genes responsible for HD phenocopies and other 
      neurodegenerative conditions, as well as candidate genes from exome sequencing in 
      3 index cases with imaging features of brain iron accumulation. We identified 
      mutations in genes associated with neurodegeneration, including CACNA1A (n = 2), 
      VPS13A (n = 1), UBQLN2 (n = 1), and VCP (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      Huntington disease phenocopies without CAG repeat expansions in HTT are not rare, 
      occurring in 12.4% (28 of 226) herein, and should be considered in genetic 
      counseling. We used next-generation sequencing combined with clinical data and 
      disease evolution to explore multiple etiologies simultaneously. Our combined 
      clinical and genetic exploration of 28 HD phenocopies identified the underlying 
      cause in 35.7% (10 of 28). In conclusion, the etiologies of HD phenocopies are 
      heterogeneous, and clinical evolution should be taken into account when searching 
      for a genetic cause. The panel of candidate genes to be examined is larger than 
      expected but can be guided by specific imaging and clinical features. Other 
      neurodegenerative diseases with late onset in which variant segregation cannot be 
      verified could be productively explored with the combined approach illustrated 
      herein.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17) is an inherited cerebellar 
      degeneration associated with trinucleotide repeat expansions in the TATA-binding 
      protein gene (TBP). Low-range expansions of TBP have recently been described in 
      association with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, these low-range expansion 
      alleles were also observed in healthy individuals. Prior distinct findings may 
      result from reduced penetrance or age-dependent susceptibility, which may 
      influence phenotypic expression. METHODS: A case-control study of 456 PD patients 
      and 374 control subjects was conducted. Data and blood samples were collected 
      during 2008-2013. Control subjects were individuals over 65 years old without 
      parkinsonism. Sizes of TBP trinucleotide repeats were analyzed. All available 
      carriers of the TBP repeat of >/=40 repeats were re-examined. RESULTS: A high 
      prevalence of carriers of TBP repeat expansion >/=41 developed PD, mainly at an 
      advanced age. Half of these carriers had onset after 70 years of age (range 
      34-84). Seven participants carried expansion alleles of >/=42, and all had PD. 
      Fourteen participants (six patients and eight controls) carried a heterozygous 
      41-repeat allele. At the current mean age of 79 years and mean follow-up period 
      of 4 years, three out of the eight control carriers of the 41-repeat allele 
      developed PD, while none of the thirteen asymptomatic carriers of the 40-repeat 
      allele did. CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of PD was observed in carriers of 
      low-range expansions of TBP (41-45 repeats), especially in elderly. This finding 
      suggests that cut-off value for pathological TBP repeat expansion appear to be 
      41.

AB  - Despite the intense debate around the repeat instability reported on the large 
      group of neurological disorders caused by trinucleotide repeat expansions, little 
      is known about the mutation process underlying alleles in the normal range, 
      diseases range, large normal alleles (LNAs). In this study, we assessed the CAG 
      repeats at SCA17 in 188 clinical SCA patients and 100 individuals without any 
      neurological signs. This highly polymorphic population displayed high variability 
      in the CAG repeats and ranged from 19-38 CAG repeats in patients with mode of 20 
      and 19-32 CAG repeats in controls with mode of 24. The triplet repeat expansion 
      was not detected in any of the 188 patients, as per the reference pathogenic 
      range (>43 repeats); however, 2.7% of the patients had >33 CAG repeats with a 
      clinical phenotype close to what is expected of SCA 17 patients. The findings of 
      this study implicate a more sophisticated interpretation of SCA17 gene and raise 
      the question about the diagnostic thresh hold between normal and expanded repeats 
      in our population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: About 50 % of Thai patients with adult-onset spinocerebellar ataxia 
      (SCA) was Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), SCA1, SCA2 and SCA6. The author 
      investigated further on less common SCAs in the patients without any known 
      mutations. METHODS: DNA samples of 82 index patients who were genetically 
      excluded MJD, SCA1, SCA2, SCA6, SCA7 and dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy 
      (DRPLA) were examined. Analysis of SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, SCA17 and SCA19 genes were 
      comprehensively performed. Normal range of trinucleotide repeat expansion sizes 
      of TATA-box-binding protein gene (TBP) were also determined in 374 control 
      subjects. RESULTS: Eight patients carried >/=42 CAG/CAA repeat allele in the TBP 
      consistent with SCA17. The pathological repeat alleles ranged from 42 to 57 
      repeats. All patients had significant degree of cognitive dysfunction. Other 
      non-ataxic phenotypes comprised of parkinsonism, chorea, dystonia and myoclonus. 
      A sporadic patient carried a heterozygous 41-repeat allele developed chronic 
      progressive cerebellar degeneration commenced at the age of 28 years. Whilst, 2 % 
      of the control subjects (8/374) carried the 41-repeat allele. Five of the 
      carriers were re-examined, and revealed that four of them had parkinsonism and/or 
      cognitive impairment without cerebellar signs. Analysis of other types of SCAs 
      was all negative. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study of SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, 
      SCA17 and SCA19 in Thais. SCA17 appears to be an important cause of ataxia in 
      Thailand. Although, the pathological cut-off point of the TBP repeat allele 
      remains unclear, the finding suggests that the 41-repeat may be a pathological 
      allele resulting late-onset or mild phenotype. Apart from ataxia, cognitive 
      impairment and parkinsonism may be clinical presentations in these carriers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the association of repeat expansion size in 10 common 
      degenerative hereditary ataxia genes with essential tremor. These genes were 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)-1 (ATXN1), SCA-2 (ATXN2), SCA-3 (ATXN3), SCA-6 
      (CACNA1A), SCA-7 (ATXN7), SCA-8 (ATXN8OS), SCA-10 (ATXN10), SCA-12 (PPP2R2B), 
      SCA-17 (TBP) and dentatorubral-pallidolysian atrophy (DRPLA) (ATN1). METHODS: 
      Genetic analysis of repeat size in 10 degenerative hereditary ataxia loci was 
      performed in 323 essential tremor patients and 299 controls enrolled at Columbia 
      University. To test for differences in the allele distribution between patients 
      and controls, a CLUMP analysis was performed. RESULTS: None of the essential 
      tremor patients had a repeat expansion in the intermediate or pathogenic range. 
      Significant differences in the distribution of repeats in the 'normal' range for 
      SCA2 and SCA8 (both p </= 0.02) were observed between essential tremor patients and 
      controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that pathogenic repeat expansions in 
      SCA loci are not associated with essential tremor.

TI  - Trehalose attenuates the gait ataxia and gliosis of spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      17 mice.
PG  - 800-10
LID - 10.1007/s11064-015-1530-4 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17) is caused by CAG/CAA repeat expansion on 
      the gene encoding a general transcription factor, TATA-box-binding protein (TBP). 
      The CAG repeat expansion leads to the reduced solubility of polyglutamine TBP and 
      induces aggregate formation. The TBP aggregation, mostly present in the cell 
      nuclei, is distinct from that in most other neurodegenerative diseases, in which 
      the aggregation is formed in cytosol or extracellular compartments. Trehalose is 
      a disaccharide issued by the Food and Drug Administration with a Generally 
      Recognized As Safe status. Lines of evidence suggest trehalose could prevent 
      protein aggregate formation in several neurodegenerative diseases, including 
      Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. In this 
      study, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of trehalose on SCA17 using 
      cerebellar primary and organotypic culture systems and a mouse model. Our results 
      showed that TBP nuclear aggregation was significantly decreased in both the 
      primary and slice cultures. Trehalose (4 %) was further supplied in the drinking 
      water of SCA17 transgenic mice. We found both the gait behavior in the footprint 
      analysis and motor coordination in the rotarod task were significantly improved 
      in the trehalose-treated SCA17 mice. The cerebellar weight was increased and the 
      astrocyte gliosis was reduced in SCA17 mice after trehalose treatment. These data 
      suggest that trehalose could be a potential nontoxic treatment for SCA17.

TI  - Modulation of the age at onset in spinocerebellar ataxia by CAG tracts in various 
      genes.
PG  - 2444-55
LID - 10.1093/brain/awu174 [doi]
AB  - Polyglutamine-coding (CAG)n repeat expansions in seven different genes cause 
      spinocerebellar ataxias. Although the size of the expansion is negatively 
      correlated with age at onset, it accounts for only 50-70% of its variability. To 
      find other factors involved in this variability, we performed a regression 
      analysis in 1255 affected individuals with identified expansions (spinocerebellar 
      ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7), recruited through the European Consortium on 
      Spinocerebellar Ataxias, to determine whether age at onset is influenced by the 
      size of the normal allele in eight causal (CAG)n-containing genes (ATXN1-3, 6-7, 
      17, ATN1 and HTT). We confirmed the negative effect of the expanded allele and 
      detected threshold effects reflected by a quadratic association between age at 
      onset and CAG size in spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 3 and 6. We also evidenced 
      an interaction between the expanded and normal alleles in trans in individuals 
      with spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 6 and 7. Except for individuals with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, age at onset was also influenced by other 
      (CAG)n-containing genes: ATXN7 in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2; ATXN2, ATN1 and 
      HTT in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3; ATXN1 and ATXN3 in spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 6; and ATXN3 and TBP in spinocerebellar ataxia type 7. This suggests that 
      there are biological relationships among these genes. The results were partially 
      replicated in four independent populations representing 460 Caucasians and 216 
      Asian samples; the differences are possibly explained by ethnic or geographical 
      differences. As the variability in age at onset is not completely explained by 
      the effects of the causative and modifier sister genes, other genetic or 
      environmental factors must also play a role in these diseases.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17) is caused by CAG repeat expansion in the 
      TATA-box binding protein gene. Studies of several polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion 
      diseases have suggested that the expanded polyQ proteins misfold and induce 
      oxidative stress to contribute to cell death. Substantial deficits in peripheral 
      tissues including lymphocytes have been shown and these peripheral abnormalities 
      could also be found in neurons possessing polyQ disease proteins. In this study, 
      we used a lymphoblastoid cell model to investigate the functional implication of 
      SCA17 expanded alleles and assess the potential therapeutic strategies that may 
      ameliorate the effects of expanded polyQ. Proteomics studies of patient/control 
      pairs including two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry and 
      immunoblotting were conducted. A total of 8 proteins with reduced expression 
      changes greater than 1.3-fold were identified, including previously reported 
      HSPA5 and HSPA8. Among 6 proteins further semi-quantified by immunoblotting and 
      real-time PCR, the reduced expression of HYOU1, PDIA3, P4HB, NQO1 and HMOX1 was 
      confirmed. Treatment with resveratrol and genipin up-regulated NQO1 and HMOX1 
      expression and reduced oxidative stress in patients' lymphoblastoid cells. The 
      results illustrate downregulation of proteins involved in the endoplasmic 
      reticulum stress response (HYOU1, HSPA5, PDIA3, and P4HB) and Nrf2-ARE signaling 
      (NQO1 and HMOX1) in SCA17 lymphoblastoid cells. Compounds increasing 
      anti-oxidative activity such as resveratrol and genipin may serve as a potential 
      therapeutic strategy for SCA17.

AB  - Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 17 (SCA17) is an autosomal dominantly inherited, 
      neurodegenerative disease characterized by ataxia, involuntary movements, and 
      dementia. A novel SCA17 mouse model having a 71 polyglutamine repeat expansion in 
      the TATA-binding protein (TBP) has shown age related motor deficit using a 
      classic motor test, yet concomitant weight increase might be a confounding factor 
      for this measurement. In this study we used an automated home cage system to test 
      several motor readouts for this same model to confirm pathological behavior 
      results and evaluate benefits of automated home cage in behavior phenotyping. Our 
      results confirm motor deficits in the Tbp/Q71 mice and present previously 
      unrecognized behavioral characteristics obtained from the automated home cage, 
      indicating its use for high-throughput screening and testing, e.g. of therapeutic 
      compounds.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias are a group of rare and heterogeneous autosomal dominant 
      disorders characterized by progressive ataxia and other features. Spinocerebellar 
      ataxia 17 (SCA17) is one of the 32 subtypes described to date and is secondary to 
      CAG/CAA repeat expansion in the gene coding for the TATA-box binding protein 
      (TBP). SCA17 is clinically heterogeneous and typically presents with slowly 
      evolving ataxia, dysarthria, dementia, depression, and other movement disorders 
      such as chorea. More than 41 CAG/CAA repeats are considered diagnostic of SCA17, 
      with more than 49 being associated with full penetrance. We report one patient 
      presenting with isolated rapidly evolving ataxia who was found to have 44 CAG/CAA 
      repeats in the TBP gene. This suggests that, while SCA17 typically slowly 
      progresses over years, its repertoire of presentations should be expanded to 
      include rapidly progressive isolated ataxia resembling paraneoplastic disorders 
      or prion disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Given the recent finding of an association between intermediate-length 
      polyglutamine (polyQ) expansions in ataxin 2 and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
      (ALS), we sought to determine whether expansions in other polyQ disease genes 
      were associated with ALS. METHODS: We assessed the polyQ lengths of ataxin 1, 
      ataxin 3, ataxin 6, ataxin 7, TBP, atrophin 1, and huntingtin in several hundred 
      patients with sporadic ALS and healthy controls. RESULTS: Other than ataxin 2, we 
      did not identify a significant association with the other polyQ genes and ALS. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the effects of ataxin 2 polyQ expansions on 
      ALS risk are likely to be rooted in the biology of ataxin 2 or ataxin 2-specific 
      interactions, rather than the presence of an expanded polyQ repeat per se. These 
      findings have important consequences for understanding the role of ataxin 2 in 
      ALS pathogenesis and provide a framework for future mechanistic studies.

AB  - More than 20 human neurological and neurodegenerative diseases are caused by 
      simple DNA repeat expansions; among these, non-coding CTG repeat expansions are 
      the basis of myotonic dystrophy (DM1). Recent work, however, has also revealed 
      that many human genes have anti-sense transcripts, raising the possibility that 
      human trinucleotide expansion diseases may be comprised of pathogenic activities 
      due both to a sense expanded-repeat transcript and to an anti-sense 
      expanded-repeat transcript. We established a Drosophila model for DM1 and tested 
      the role of interactions between expanded CTG transcripts and expanded CAG repeat 
      transcripts. These studies revealed dramatically enhanced toxicity in flies 
      co-expressing CTG with CAG expanded repeats. Expression of the two transcripts 
      led to novel pathogenesis with the generation of dcr-2 and ago2-dependent 21-nt 
      triplet repeat-derived siRNAs. These small RNAs targeted the expression of 
      CAG-containing genes, such as Ataxin-2 and TATA binding protein (TBP), which bear 
      long CAG repeats in both fly and man. These findings indicate that the generation 
      of triplet repeat-derived siRNAs may dramatically enhance toxicity in human 
      repeat expansion diseases in which anti-sense transcription occurs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Macrosatellites are some of the largest variable number tandem 
      repeats in the human genome, but what role these unusual sequences perform is 
      unknown. Their importance to human health is clearly demonstrated by the 4q35 
      macrosatellite D4Z4 that is associated with the onset of the muscle degenerative 
      disease facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. Nevertheless, many other 
      macrosatellite arrays in the human genome remain poorly characterized. RESULTS: 
      Here we describe the organization, tandem repeat copy number variation, 
      transmission stability and expression of four macrosatellite arrays in the human 
      genome: the TAF11-Like array located on chromosomes 5p15.1, the SST1 arrays on 
      4q28.3 and 19q13.12, the PRR20 array located on chromosome 13q21.1, and the ZAV 
      array at 9q32. All are polymorphic macrosatellite arrays that at least for 
      TAF11-Like and SST1 show evidence of meiotic instability. With the exception of 
      the SST1 array that is ubiquitously expressed, all are expressed at high levels 
      in the testis and to a lesser extent in the brain. CONCLUSIONS: Our results 
      extend the number of characterized macrosatellite arrays in the human genome and 
      provide the foundation for formulation of hypotheses to begin assessing their 
      functional role in the human genome.

AB  - We report on a Chinese family with three members who have CAG repeat expansion in 
      the ataxin-3, two members present with expanded trinucleotide repeat in both the 
      ataxin-3 and tata-binding protein (TBP) and an individual who carries expanded 
      CAG/CAA repeat in the TBP. Only the patients who carry an allele with expansion 
      in the ataxin-3 gene presented with clinical symptoms. This interesting family 
      presents a unique mutation state. We will continue to track this family in the 
      future, which may help us further elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 3 and 17. The study also provides us a novel 
      conception that mutations from two pathogenetic genes may coexist in one patient 
      and SCA-affected patients with intermediate allele need to be further excluded 
      for other SCA subtypes.

TI  - SCA17 repeat expansion: mildly expanded CAG/CAA repeat alleles in neurological 
      disorders and the functional implications.
PG  - 375-80
LID - 10.1016/j.cca.2009.12.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17) involves the expression of a 
      CAG/CAA expansion mutation in the gene encoding TATA-box binding protein (TBP), a 
      general transcription initiation factor. The spectrum of SCA17 clinical 
      presentation is broad. METHODS: We screened for triplet expansion in the TBP gene 
      in Taiwanese Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and atypical 
      parkinsonism and investigated the functional implication of expanded alleles 
      using lymphoblastoid cells as a model. RESULTS: A total of 6 mildly expanded 
      alleles (44-46) were identified in patients group. The frequency of the 
      individuals carrying expanded alleles in PD (3/602 [0.5%]), AD (2/245 [0.8%]) and 
      atypical parkinsonism (1/44 [2.3%]) is not significant as compared to that in the 
      control subjects (0/644 [0.0%]). In lymphoblastoid cells, HSPA5, HSPA8 and HSPB1 
      expression levels in cells with expanded TBP were significantly lower than that 
      of the control cells. Although not significantly, the levels of PARK7 protein 
      isoforms 6.1 and 6.4 are notably increased in SCA17 lymphoblastoid cells. 
      Treatment of TBH (tert-butyl hydroperoxide) significantly increases cell death in 
      the cells with mildly expanded TBP. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings expand the spectrum 
      of SCA17 phenotype and may contribute to our understanding of the disease.

TI  - Huntington's disease-like and ataxia syndromes: identification of a family with a 
      de novo SCA17/TBP mutation.
PG  - 12-5
LID - 10.1016/j.parkreldis.2009.06.006 [doi]
AB  - The autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias, commonly referred to as SCAs, are 
      clinically and genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders. 
      Twenty-eight genetic subtypes have been identified, of which 7 are caused by 
      expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat that encodes a polyglutamine tract in the 
      respective proteins. SCA17 is caused by a CAG/CAA repeat expansion in the TATA 
      box-binding protein-gene (TBP). In some cases the clinical phenotype of SCA17 
      overlaps that of Huntington's disease (HD), hence the use of the term 
      Huntington's disease-like. We screened 89 patients with a Huntington's 
      disease-like phenotype without the HD-gene mutation and 178 patients with 
      genetically unclassified cerebellar ataxia for the mutation in TBP. A 33-year old 
      woman presenting with an HD like phenotype with a de novo 54 CAG/CAA repeat 
      expansion was identified. Her normal allele included 38 repeats. The patient's 
      mother and father both carried normal range repeats, 38/38 and 33/39 
      respectively. Analysis of the repeat structures revealed that the expansion had 
      occurred upon expansion of the longer paternal allele. We conclude that, however 
      rare, SCA17 must be considered as a cause of Huntington's disease-like phenotypes 
      and ataxia syndromes, also in isolated cases.

AB  - X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP, DYT3), endemic in the Philippine island of 
      Panay, is characterized by the clinical onset with dystonia followed by 
      parkinsonism. We found a 35-year-old American male patient, originally from Panay 
      with typical XDP, has a 2-year history of parkinsonism, dystonia, and tremor. 
      Ancestral DYT3 haplotype and disease-specific SVA (short interspersed nuclear 
      element, variable number of tandem repeats, and Alu composite) retrotransposon 
      insertion were identified in the DYT3 proband and two female unaffected family 
      members. No mutation(s) and expression changes in peripheral blood lymphocytes 
      were observed in the TATA-binding protein-associated factor 1 gene (TAF1) or the 
      chemokine CXC motif receptor 3 gene (CXCR3) of the proband or other DYT3 
      carriers. These findings indicate blood DNA test has a diagnostic utility and 
      implications for genetic counseling in families with DYT3. In contrast, TAF1 and 
      CXCR3 gene expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes is not a suitable surrogate 
      disease marker for DYT3.

TI  - Instability of expanded CAG/CAA repeats in spinocerebellar ataxia type 17.
PG  - 215-22
AB  - Trinucleotide repeat expansions are dynamic mutations causing many neurological 
      disorders, and their instability is influenced by multiple factors. Repeat 
      configuration seems particularly important, and pure repeats are thought to be 
      more unstable than interrupted repeats. But direct evidence is still lacking. 
      Here, we presented strong support for this hypothesis from our studies on 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17). SCA17 is a typical polyglutamine disease 
      caused by CAG repeat expansion in TBP (TATA binding protein), and is unique in 
      that the pure expanded polyglutamine tract is coded by either a simple 
      configuration with long stretches of pure CAGs or a complex configuration 
      containing CAA interruptions. By small pool PCR (SP-PCR) analysis of blood DNA 
      from SCA17 patients of distinct racial backgrounds, we quantitatively assessed 
      the instability of these two types of expanded alleles coding similar length of 
      polyglutamine expansion. Mutation frequency in patients harboring pure CAG 
      repeats is 2-3 folds of those with CAA interruptions. Interestingly, the pure CAG 
      repeats showed both expansion and deletion while the interrupted repeats 
      exhibited mostly deletion at a significantly lower frequency. These data strongly 
      suggest that repeat configuration is a critical determinant for instability, and 
      CAA interruptions might serve as a limiting element for further expansion of CAG 
      repeats in SCA17 locus, suggesting a molecular basis for lack of anticipation in 
      SCA17 families with interrupted CAG expansion.

TI  - Case control analysis of repeat expansion size in ataxia.
PG  - 28-32
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of clinically and genetically 
      heterogeneous neurological diseases. The expansion of unstable microsatellite 
      repeats has been identified as the underlying pathogenic cause of 10 subtypes of 
      autosomal dominant SCAs. The aetiology of sporadic SCA is unknown. The aim of 
      this study was to investigate the effect of large normal repeats in patients 
      presenting with sporadic or familial ataxia compared to a control population. The 
      size of the expansion was determined using a fluorescent PCR approach in 10 
      common SCA genes: SCA-1 (ATXN1), SCA-2 (ATXN2), SCA-3 (ATXN3), SCA-6 (CACNA1A), 
      SCA-7 (ATXN7), SCA-8 (ATXN8OS), SCA-10 (ATXN10), SCA-12 (PPP2R2B), SCA-17 (TBP) 
      and DRPLA (ATN1), in 165 ataxia patients and 307 controls of Welsh origin. There 
      was no difference between cases and controls in the distribution of the large 
      normal alleles, or in the distribution of the combined CAG repeats. The normal 
      allele distribution in the Welsh population was largely similar to that of other 
      Caucasian populations. Our study failed to demonstrate an effect of large normal 
      repeats on the susceptibility to develop ataxia.

TI  - Multiplex families with multiple system atrophy.
PG  - 545-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple system atrophy (MSA) has been considered a sporadic disease, 
      without patterns of inheritance. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical features of 
      4 multiplex families with MSA, including clinical genetic aspects. DESIGN: 
      Clinical and genetic study. SETTING: Four departments of neurology in Japan. 
      Patients Eight patients in 4 families with parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, and 
      autonomic failure with age at onset ranging from 58 to 72 years. Two siblings in 
      each family were affected with these conditions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical 
      evaluation was performed according to criteria by Gilman et al. Trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion in the responsible genes for the spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 
      series and for dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) was evaluated by 
      polymerase chain reaction. Direct sequence analysis of coding regions in the 
      alpha-synuclein gene was performed. RESULTS: Consanguineous marriage was observed 
      in 1 of 4 families. Among 8 patients, 1 had definite MSA, 5 had probable MSA, and 
      2 had possible MSA. The most frequent phenotype was MSA with predominant 
      parkinsonism, observed in 5 patients. Six patients showed pontine atrophy with 
      cross sign or slitlike signal change at the posterolateral putaminal margin or 
      both on brain magnetic resonance imaging. Possibilities of hereditary ataxias, 
      including SCA1 (ataxin 1, ATXN1), SCA2 (ATXN2), Machado-Joseph disease/SCA3 
      (ATXN1), SCA6 (ATXN1), SCA7 (ATXN7), SCA12 (protein phosphatase 2, regulatory 
      subunit B, beta isoform; PP2R2B), SCA17 (TATA box binding protein, TBP) and DRPLA 
      (atrophin 1; ATN1), were excluded, and no mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene 
      were found. CONCLUSIONS: Findings in these multiplex families suggest the 
      presence of familial MSA with autosomal recessive inheritance and a genetic 
      predisposition to MSA. Molecular genetic approaches focusing on familial MSA are 
      expected to provide clues to the pathogenesis of MSA.

TI  - Reduced neuron-specific expression of the TAF1 gene is associated with X-linked 
      dystonia-parkinsonism.
PG  - 393-406
AB  - X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP) is a movement disorder endemic to the 
      Philippines. The disease locus, DYT3, has been mapped to Xq13.1. In a search for 
      the causative gene, we performed genomic sequencing analysis, followed by 
      expression analysis of XDP brain tissues. We found a disease-specific SVA (short 
      interspersed nuclear element, variable number of tandem repeats, and Alu 
      composite) retrotransposon insertion in an intron of the TATA-binding 
      protein-associated factor 1 gene (TAF1), which encodes the largest component of 
      the TFIID complex, and significantly decreased expression levels of TAF1 and the 
      dopamine receptor D2 gene (DRD2) in the caudate nucleus. We also identified an 
      abnormal pattern of DNA methylation in the retrotransposon in the genome from the 
      patient's caudate, which could account for decreased expression of TAF1. Our 
      findings suggest that the reduced neuron-specific expression of the TAF1 gene is 
      associated with XDP.

TI  - Repeat expansion in spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 alleles of the TATA-box 
      binding protein gene: an evolutionary approach.
PG  - 81-7
AB  - The variability and mutational changes of the CAG microsatellite in the TATA-box 
      binding protein gene (TBP) were studied. We sequenced the microsatellite of the 
      TBP gene of 25 unrelated individuals from northern Germany (10 SCA17 patients and 
      15 unaffected control individuals). In addition, the microsatellites were 
      sequenced from individuals of 10 northern German families with at least one 
      family member affected by SCA17. To study also the evolutionary history of this 
      CAG/CAA microsatellite in nonhuman primates, the homologous regions were analysed 
      from Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, Pongo pygmaeus, P. abellii, Hylobates lar, 
      Nomascus leucogenys, Symphalangus syndactylus, Macaca mulatta, Papio hamadryas, 
      Colobus polykomos and Callithrix jacchus. Three major conclusions were drawn: (i) 
      Patterns of synonymous CAA interruptions in the microsatellite are characteristic 
      and likely to result from selection for stabilizing the repetitive region; (ii) 
      Interspecific comparisons indicate that SCA17 is likely to be a human trait. The 
      most common allele in humans (37 repeats) is close to the threshold value upon 
      which neurodegenerative changes can occur and may act as a repository for 
      expanded, pathogenic alleles; (iii) The cassette-like structure of five out of 17 
      expanded alleles can be attributed to unequal crossing over. This can explain the 
      rare and sporadic de novo generation of SCA17 alleles.

TI  - Exclusion of mutations in the PRNP, JPH3, TBP, ATN1, CREBBP, POU3F2 and FTL genes 
      as a cause of disease in Portuguese patients with a Huntington-like phenotype.
PG  - 645-651
LID - 10.1007/s10038-006-0001-9 [doi]
AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterised by chorea, cognitive impairment, dementia and personality changes, 
      caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat in the HD gene. Often, patients with a 
      similar clinical presentation do not carry expansions of the CAG repeat in this 
      gene [Huntington disease-like (HDL) patients]. We report the genetic analysis of 
      107 Portuguese patients with an HDL phenotype. The HDL genes PRNP and JPH3, 
      encoding the prion protein and junctophilin-3, respectively, were screened for 
      repeat expansions in these patients. Given the partial clinical overlap of SCA17, 
      DRPLA and neuroferritinopathy with HD, their causative genes (TBP, ATN1, and FTL, 
      respectively) were also analysed. Finally, repeat expansions in two candidate 
      genes, CREBBP and POU3F2, which encode the nuclear transcriptional coactivator 
      CREB-binding protein and the CNS-specific transcription factor N-Oct-3, 
      respectively, were also studied. Expansions of the repetitive tracts of the PRNP, 
      JPH3, TBP, ATN1, CREBBP and POU3F2 genes were excluded in all patients, as were 
      sequence alterations in the FTL gene. Since none of the genes already included in 
      the differential diagnosis of HD was responsible for the disease in our sample, 
      the genetic heterogeneity of the HDL phenotype is still open for investigation.

TI  - Genetic analysis of SCA2, 3 and 17 in idiopathic Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 11-4
AB  - Recent reports of SCA2 and SCA3 patients who presented with levodopa responsive 
      parkinsonism have generated considerable interest as they have implications for 
      genetic testing. It is unclear whether ethnic race alone or founder effects 
      within certain geographical region explain such an association. In this study, we 
      conducted genetic analysis of SCA2, 3, 17 in an ethnic Chinese cohort with early 
      onset and familial Parkinson's disease (PD) and healthy controls. A total of 191 
      subjects comprising of 91 PD and 100 healthy controls were examined. We 
      identified one positive case of SCA2 in an early-onset sporadic PD patient who 
      had CAG 36 repeats, yielding a prevalence of 2.2% in early-onset sporadic PD 
      patients and less than 1.0% in our study PD population. The size of the repeats 
      was lower than the expanded repeats (38-57) in SCA2 patients with ataxia in our 
      population. All the children of the patient were physically normal even though 
      some of them carried the repeat expansion of similar size. No cases and controls 
      were positive for SCA3 and SCA17. We do not think routine screening of SCA2, SCA3 
      and SCA17 for all idiopathic PD patients is cost-effective in our ethnic Chinese 
      population. However, SCA2 should be a differential diagnosis in young onset 
      sporadic PD when genetic mutations of other known PD genes have been excluded.

TI  - Both normal and polyglutamine- expanded ataxin-7 are components of TFTC-type GCN5 
      histone acetyltransferase- containing complexes.
PG  - 155-63
AB  - SCA7 (spinocerebellar ataxia type 7) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      CAG repeat expansion in the SCA7 gene that leads to elongation of a polyglutamine 
      tract in ataxin-7, a protein of unknown function. Sgf73, a putative yeast 
      orthologue of ataxin-7, has been identified as a new component of the yeast SAGA 
      (Spt/Ada/Gcn5 acetyltransferase) multisubunit complex, a co-activator required 
      for the transcription of a subset of RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. We show 
      here that ataxin-7 is an integral component of mammalian SAGA-like complexes, 
      i.e. the TFTC [TBP (TATA-binding protein)-free TAF (TBP-associated factor) 
      complex] and the STAGA (SPT3/TAF9/GCN5 acetyltransferase) complex. In agreement 
      with this, immunoprecipitation of ataxin-7 retained a histone acetyltransferase 
      activity characteristic of TFTC-like complexes. Moreover, polyglutamine expansion 
      in ataxin-7 did not affect its incorporation into TFTCs/STAGA complexes purified 
      from cells from a SCA7 patient. We demonstrate here that ataxin-7 is the human 
      orthologue of a the yeast SAGA Sgf73 subunit, and is a bona fide subunit of human 
      TFTC-like transcriptional complexes.

TI  - CAG repeats containing CAA interruptions form branched hairpin structures in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 transcripts.
PG  - 3898-910
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), one of the hereditary human 
      neurodegenerative disorders, is caused by the expansion of the CAG tandem repeats 
      in the translated sequence of the SCA2 gene. In a normal population the CAG 
      repeat is polymorphic not only in length but also in the number and localization 
      of its CAA interruptions. The aim of this study was to determine the structure of 
      the repeat region in the normal and mutant SCA2 transcripts and to reveal the 
      structural basis of its normal function and dysfunction. We show here that the 
      properties of the CAA interruptions are major determinants of the CAG repeat 
      folding in the normal SCA2 transcripts. We also show that the uninterrupted 
      repeats in mutant transcripts form slippery hairpins, whose length is further 
      reduced by the base pairing of the repeat portion with a specific flanking 
      sequence. The structural organization of the repeat interruption systems present 
      in other human transcripts, such as SCA1, TBP, FOXP2, and MAML2, are also 
      discussed.

TI  - Mutation at the SCA17 locus is not a common cause of primary dystonia.
PG  - 1232-4
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17) is a dominant progressive 
      neurodegenerative disorder, caused by a triplet repeat expansion within the 
      TATA-binding protein. As well as ataxia and dementia, Parkinsonism and dystonia 
      are common in SCA17. In some pedigrees focal dystonia in the absence of ataxia 
      has been described as a main clinical feature. To evaluate the relevance of SCA17 
      mutations for primary dystonia, we examined the TBP repeat expansion in a series 
      of 288 patients with different subtypes of primary torsion dystonia. We did not 
      find any repeat sizes in the pathogenic range. We conclude that the SCA17 repeat 
      expansion is not a common cause of familial and sporadic dystonia.

TI  - Ataxin-7 is a subunit of GCN5 histone acetyltransferase-containing complexes.
PG  - 1257-65
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      CAG repeat expansion in the SCA7 gene leading to elongation of a polyglutamine 
      tract in ataxin-7, a protein of unknown function. A putative ataxin-7 yeast 
      orthologue (SGF73) has been identified recently as a new component of the SAGA 
      (Spt/Ada/Gcn5 acetylase) multisubunit complex, a coactivator required for 
      transcription of a subset of RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. We show here that 
      ataxin-7 is an integral component of the mammalian SAGA-like complexes, the 
      TATA-binding protein-free TAF-containing complex (TFTC) and the SPT3/TAF9/GCN5 
      acetyltransferase complex (STAGA). In agreement, immunoprecipitation of ataxin-7 
      retained a histone acetyltransferase activity, characteristic for TFTC-like 
      complexes. We further identified a minimal domain in ataxin-7 that is required 
      for interaction with TFTC/STAGA subunits and is conserved highly through 
      evolution, allowing the identification of a SCA7 gene family. We showed that this 
      domain contains a conserved Cys(3)His motif that binds zinc, forming a new 
      zinc-binding domain. Finally, polyglutamine expansion in ataxin-7 did not affect 
      its incorporation into TFTC/STAGA complexes purified from SCA7 patient cells. We 
      demonstrate here that ataxin-7 is the human orthologue of the yeast SAGA SGF73 
      subunit and is a bona fide subunit of the human TFTC-like transcriptional 
      complexes.

TI  - Possible reduced penetrance of expansion of 44 to 47 CAG/CAA repeats in the 
      TATA-binding protein gene in spinocerebellar ataxia type 17.
PG  - 209-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17) is an autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxia caused by expansion of CAG/CAA trinucleotide repeats in the 
      TATA-binding protein (TBP) gene. Because the number of triplets in patients with 
      SCA17 in previous studies ranged from 43 to 63, the normal number of 
      trinucleotide units has been considered to be 42 or less. However, some healthy 
      subjects in SCA17 pedigrees carry alleles with the same number of expanded 
      repeats as patients with SCA17. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the minimum number of 
      CAG/CAA repeats in the TBP gene that causes SCA17. DESIGN: We amplified the 
      region of the TBP gene containing the CAG/CAA repeat by means of polymerase chain 
      reaction and performed fragment and sequence analyses. PATIENTS: The subjects 
      included 734 patients with SCA (480 patients with sporadic SCA and 254 patients 
      with familial SCA) without CAG repeat expansions at the SCA1, SCA2, 
      Machado-Joseph disease, SCA6, SCA7, or dentatorubral-pallidolluysian atrophy 
      loci, with 162 healthy subjects, 216 patients with Parkinson disease, and 195 
      with Alzheimer disease as control subjects. RESULTS: Eight patients with SCA 
      possessed an allele with more than 43 CAG/CAA repeats. Among the non-SCA groups, 
      alleles with 43 to 45 repeats were seen in 3 healthy subjects and 2 with 
      Parkinson disease. In 1 SCA pedigree, a patient with possible SCA17 and her 
      healthy sister had alleles with 45 repeats. A 34-year-old man carrying alleles 
      with 47 and 44 repeats (47/44) had developed progressive cerebellar ataxia and 
      myoclonus at 25 years of age, and he exhibited dementia and pyramidal signs. He 
      was the only affected person in his pedigree, although his father and mother 
      carried alleles with mildly expanded repeats (44/36 and 47/36, respectively). In 
      another pedigree, 1 patient carried a 43-repeat allele, whereas another patient 
      had 2 normal alleles, indicating that the 43-repeat allele may not be pathologic 
      in this family. CONCLUSIONS: We estimate that 44 CAG/CAA repeats is the minimum 
      number required to cause SCA17. However, the existence of unaffected subjects 
      with mildly expanded triplets suggests that the TBP gene mutation may not 
      penetrate fully. Homozygosity of alleles with mildly expanded triplet repeats in 
      the TBP gene might contribute to the pathologic phenotype.

TI  - Clinical features and neuropathology of autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia 
      (SCA17).
PG  - 367-75
AB  - Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of 
      neurodegenerative disorders clinically characterized by late-onset ataxia and 
      variable other manifestations. Genetically and clinically, SCA is highly 
      heterogeneous. Recently, CAG repeat expansions in the gene encoding TATA-binding 
      protein (TBP) have been found in a new form of SCA, which has been designated 
      SCA17. To estimate the frequency of SCA17 among white SCA patients and to define 
      the phenotypic variability, we determined the frequency of SCA17 in a large 
      sample of 1,318 SCA patients. In total, 15 patients in four autosomal dominant 
      SCA families had CAG/CAA repeat expansions in the TBP gene ranging from 45 to 54 
      repeats. The clinical features of our SCA17 patients differ from other SCA types 
      by manifesting with psychiatric abnormalities and dementia. The neuropathology of 
      SCA17 can be classified as a "pure cerebellar" or "cerebello-olivary" form of 
      ataxia. However, intranuclear neuronal inclusion bodies with immunoreactivity to 
      anti-TBP and antipolyglutamine were much more widely distributed throughout the 
      brain gray matter than in other SCAs. Based on clinical and genetic data, we 
      conclude that SCA17 is rare among white SCA patients. SCA17 should be considered 
      in sporadic and familial cases of ataxia with accompanying psychiatric symptoms 
      and dementia.

TI  - SCA17 caused by homozygous repeat expansion in TBP due to partial isodisomy 6.
PG  - 629-32
AB  - An expanded polyglutamine domain in the TATA-binding protein (TBP) has been 
      described in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17) characterized 
      by cerebellar ataxia associated with dementia. TBP is a general transcription 
      initiation factor that regulates the expression of most eukaryotic genes 
      transcribed by RNA polymerase II. SCA17, as an autosomal dominantly inherited 
      progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is caused by heterozygous expansion of a 
      CAG repeat coding for glutamine. Alleles with 27 to a maximum of 44 glutamine 
      residues were found as the normal range, whereas expansions above 45 repeat units 
      were considered pathological. Here, we present a patient with a very severe 
      phenotype with a late onset but rapidly progressing ataxia associated with 
      dementia and homozygous 47 glutamine residues caused by an apparent partial 
      isodisomy 6. This extraordinary case has important implications for the insights 
      of TBP and SCA17. The expanded polyglutamine domain in both TBP copies is not 
      correlated with embryonic death indicating that the normal function of the 
      protein is not disrupted by this kind of mutation but may account for the 
      dementia seen in this patient.

TI  - Mutation at the SCA17 locus is not a common cause of parkinsonism.
PG  - 317-20
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 17 is a dominant, progressive, neurodegenerative 
      disorder. The disease is caused by a triplet repeat expansion mutation within 
      TATA-binding protein (TBP). Ataxia, dementia, parkinsonism and dystonia are 
      common features. We have previously shown in several pedigrees that SCA-2 and 
      SCA-3 can cause both parkinsonism and typical Parkinson's disease in the absence 
      of prominent ataxia; a finding which has been confirmed by others. Given these 
      previous findings and the description of parkinsonism as a common feature of 
      SCA-17 we examined this locus in a series of probands from families with 2 or 
      more members affected with parkinsonism (n=51) and a group of sporadic 
      parkinsonism patients (n=59). We did not find any repeat sizes in the pathogenic 
      range. The repeats we observed ranged from 29 to 41 (mean 36.8; median 37). We 
      conclude that SCA-17 repeat expansion mutations are not a common cause of 
      familial parkinsonism.

TI  - Huntington's disease-like phenotype due to trinucleotide repeat expansions in the 
      TBP and JPH3 genes.
PG  - 1599-603
AB  - We report a group of 252 patients with a Huntington's disease-like (HDL) 
      phenotype, including 60 with typical Huntington's disease, who had tested 
      negative for pathological expansions in the IT15 gene, the major mutation in 
      Huntington's disease. They were screened for repeat expansions in two other genes 
      involved in HDL phenotypes: those encoding the junctophilin-3 (JPH3/HDL2) and 
      prion (PRNP/HDL1) proteins. In addition, because of the clinical overlap between 
      patients with HDL disease and autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia or 
      dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), we investigated trinucleotide 
      repeat expansions in genes encoding the TATA-binding protein (TBP/SCA17) and 
      atrophin-1 (DRPLA). Two patients carried 43 and 50 uninterrupted CTG repeats in 
      the JPH3 gene. Two other patients had 44 and 46 CAA/CAG repeats in the TBP gene. 
      Patients with expansions in the TBP or JPH3 genes had HDL phenotypes 
      indistinguishable from Huntington's disease. Taking into account patients with 
      typical Huntington's disease, their frequencies were evaluated as 3% each in our 
      series of typical HDL patients. Interestingly, incomplete penetrance of the 46 
      CAA/CAG repeat in the TBP gene was observed in a 59-year-old transmitting, but 
      healthy, parent. Furthermore, we report a new configuration of the expanded TBP 
      allele, with 11 repeats on the first polymorphic stretch of CAGs. Expansions in 
      the DRPLA gene and insertions in the PRNP gene were not found in our group of 
      patients. Further genetic heterogeneity of the HDL phenotype therefore exists.

TI  - CAG repeat expansion in the TATA box-binding protein gene causes autosomal 
      dominant cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 1939-47
AB  - At least 13 loci responsible for autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) have 
      been identified. Spinocerebellar ataxia 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 are caused by translated 
      CAG repeat expansions. However, in France, >30% of ADCAs are not explained by the 
      known genes. Recently, analysis of the TATA box-binding protein (TBP) gene, one 
      of the transcription factors known to contain a CAG/CAA repeat, in patients with 
      progressive cerebellar ataxia revealed one sporadic case with 63 repeats. We 
      examined this gene in 162 index cases with ADCA. An expanded repeat with 46 
      repeat units was detected in a single index case from Belgium. In this family, 
      two affected members and six unaffected, but at-risk, individuals carried 
      expanded alleles. Interestingly, the expanded repeat was stable during 
      transmission. The main clinical features in six patients were cerebellar ataxia, 
      dementia and behavioural disturbances with onset in their fourth to sixth decade. 
      The main neuropathological finding was severe neuronal loss and gliosis in the 
      Purkinje cell layer. Immunohistochemical analysis showed neuronal intranuclear 
      inclusions containing expanded polyglutamine, indicating that this disease shares 
      several features with other polyglutamine diseases. This study demonstrates that 
      CAG/CAA repeat expansion in the TBP gene causes ADCA with dementia and/or 
      psychiatric manifestations.

      associated with a new form of inherited ataxia.
PG  - 160-4
AB  - A novel neurological syndrome has recently been described to be associated with 
      an expanded polyglutamine domain. The expansion results from partial duplication 
      within the TATA-binding protein (TBP). By investigation of 604 sporadic and 
      familial cases with various forms of neurological syndromes and 157 unaffected 
      individuals, we found repeat expansions in the TBP in four patients of two 
      families with autosomal dominant inheritance of ataxia, dystonia, and 
      intellectual decline. Two different genotypes for the repetitive sequence could 
      be demonstrated which led to elongated polyglutamine stretches between 50 and 55 
      residues, whereas normal alleles with 27 to a maximum of 44 glutamine residues 
      were found in this study. The expansion to 50 or more glutamine residues results 
      in a pathological phenotype and confirms the report of a new polyglutamine 
      disease.

TI  - A neurological disease caused by an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat in the 
      TATA-binding protein gene: a new polyglutamine disease?
PG  - 2047-53
AB  - To investigate whether the expansion of CAG repeats of the TATA-binding protein 
      (TBP) gene is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, we have 
      screened 118 patients with various forms of neurological disease and identified a 
      sporadic-onset patient with unique neurologic symptoms consisting of ataxia and 
      intellectual deterioration associated with de novo expansion of the CAG repeat of 
      the TBP gene. The mutant TBP with an expanded polyglutamine stretch (63 
      glutamines) was demonstrated to be expressed in lymphoblastoid cell lines at a 
      level comparable with that of wild-type TBP. The CAG repeat of the TBP gene 
      consists of impure CAG repeat and the de novo expansion involves partial 
      duplication of the CAG repeat. The present study provides new insights into 
      sporadic-onset trinucleotide repeat diseases that involve de novo CAG repeat 
      expansion.

TI  - Isolation of active genes containing CAG repeats by DNA strand invasion by a 
      peptide nucleic acid.
PG  - 1901-5
AB  - An amplification of tandem CAG trinucleotide sequences in DNA due to errors in 
      DNA replication is involved in at least four hereditary neurodegenerative 
      diseases. The CAG triplet repeats when translated into protein give rise to 
      tracts of glutamine residues, which are a prominent feature of many transcription 
      factors, including the TATA-binding protein of transcription factor TFIID. We 
      have used a biotin-labeled, complementary peptide nucleic acid (PNA) to invade 
      the CAG repeats in intact chromatin and then employed a method for the selective 
      isolation of transcriptionally active chromatin restriction fragments containing 
      the PNA.DNA hybrids. The PNA-containing chromatin fragments were captured on 
      streptavidin-agarose magnetic beads and shown to contain all the CAG.PNA hybrids 
      of the active chromatin fraction. DNA hybridization experiments using a DNA probe 
      specific for unique sequences downstream of the CAG-tandem repeats confirmed that 
      the PNA.DNA hybrids contained the transcribed gene for the TATA-binding protein. 
      In contrast, no hybridization signal was detected with a DNA probe specific for 
      the c-myc protooncogene, which is amplified and transcriptionally active in COLO 
      320DM cells but lacks CAG tandem repeats.

TI  - "Cryptic" repeating triplets of purines and pyrimidines (cRRY(i)) are frequent 
      and polymorphic: analysis of coding cRRY(i) in the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and 
      TATA-binding protein (TBP) genes.
PG  - 1182-90
AB  - Triplets of the form of purine, purine, pyrimidine (RRY(i)) are enhanced in 
      frequency in the genomes of primates, rodents, and bacteria. Some RRY(i) are 
      "cryptic" repeats (cRRY(i)) in which no one tandem run of a trinucleotide 
      predominates. A search of human GenBank sequence revealed that the sequences of 
      cRRY(i) are highly nonrandom. Three randomly chosen human cRRY(i) were sequenced 
      in search of polymorphic alleles. Multiple polymorphic alleles were found in 
      cRRY(i) in the coding regions of the genes for proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and 
      TATA-binding protein (TBP). The highly polymorphic TBP cRRY(i) was characterized 
      in detail. Direct sequencing of 157 unrelated human alleles demonstrated the 
      presence of 20 different alleles which resulted in 29-40 consecutive glutamines 
      in the amino-terminal region of TBP. These alleles are differentially distributed 
      among the races. PCR was used to screen 1,846 additional alleles in order to 
      characterize more fully the range of variation in the population. Three 
      additional alleles were discovered, but there was no example of a substantial 
      sequence amplification as is seen in the repeat sequences associated with 
      X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, myotonic dystrophy, or the fragile-X 
      syndrome. The structure of the TBP cRRY(i) is conserved in the five monkey 
      species examined. In the chimpanzee, examination of four individuals revealed 
      that the cRRY(i) was highly polymorphic, but the pattern of polymorphism differed 
      from that in humans. The TBP cRRY(i) displays both similarities with and 
      differences from the previously described RRY(i) in the coding sequence of the 
      androgen receptor. Our data suggest how simple tandem repeats could evolve from 
      cryptic repeats.
