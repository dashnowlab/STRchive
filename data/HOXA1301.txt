AB  - Expansions of amino acid repeats occur in >20 inherited human disorders, and many 
      occur in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of transcription factors (TFs). 
      Such diseases are associated with protein aggregation, but the contribution of 
      aggregates to pathology has been controversial. Here, we report that alanine 
      repeat expansions in the HOXD13 TF, which cause hereditary synpolydactyly in 
      humans, alter its phase separation capacity and its capacity to co-condense with 
      transcriptional co-activators. HOXD13 repeat expansions perturb the composition 
      of HOXD13-containing condensates in vitro and in vivo and alter the 
      transcriptional program in a cell-specific manner in a mouse model of 
      synpolydactyly. Disease-associated repeat expansions in other TFs (HOXA13, RUNX2, 
      and TBP) were similarly found to alter their phase separation. These results 
      suggest that unblending of transcriptional condensates may underlie human 
      pathologies. We present a molecular classification of TF IDRs, which provides a 
      framework to dissect TF function in diseases associated with transcriptional 
      dysregulation.

TI  - Analysis of de novo HOXA13 polyalanine expansions supports replication slippage 
      without repair in their generation.
PG  - 1019-27
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.35843 [doi]
AB  - Polyalanine repeat expansion diseases are hypothesized to result from unequal 
      chromosomal recombination, yet mechanistic studies are lacking. We identified two 
      de novo cases of hand-foot-genital syndrome (HFGS) associated with polyalanine 
      expansions in HOXA13 that afforded rare opportunities to investigate the 
      mechanism. The first patient with HFGS was heterozygous for a de novo nine codon 
      polyalanine expansion. Haplotype investigation showed that the expansion arose on 
      the maternally inherited chromosome but not through unequal crossing over between 
      homologs, leaving unequal sister chromatid exchange during mitosis or meiosis or 
      slipped mispairing as possible explanations. The asymptomatic father of the 
      second patient with HFGS was mosaic for a six codon polyalanine expansion. 
      Multiple tissue PCR and clonal analysis of paternal fibroblasts showed only 
      expansion/WT and WT/WT clones, and haplotype data showed that two unaffected 
      offspring inherited the same paternal allele without the expansion, supporting a 
      postzygotic origin. Absence of the contracted allele in the mosaic father does 
      not support sister chromatid exchange in the origin of the expansion. Mosaicism 
      for HOXA13 polyalanine expansions may be associated with a normal phenotype, 
      making examination of parental DNA essential in apparently de novo HFGS cases to 
      predict accurate recurrence risks. We could not find an example in the literature 
      where unequal sister chromatid exchange has been proven for any polyalanine 
      expansion, suggesting that the principal mechanism for polyalanine expansions 
      (and contractions) is slipped mispairing without repair or that the true 
      frequency of unequal sister chromatid exchange involving these repeats is low.
