AB  - The extensive clinical and genetic heterogeneity of congenital limb malformation 
      calls for comprehensive genome-wide analysis of genetic variation. Genome 
      sequencing (GS) has the potential to identify all genetic variants. Here we aim 
      to determine the diagnostic potential of GS as a comprehensive one-test-for-all 
      strategy in a cohort of undiagnosed patients with congenital limb malformations. 
      We collected 69 cases (64 trios, 1 duo, 5 singletons) with congenital limb 
      malformations with no molecular diagnosis after standard clinical genetic testing 
      and performed genome sequencing. We also developed a framework to identify 
      potential noncoding pathogenic variants. We identified likely 
      pathogenic/disease-associated variants in 12 cases (17.4%) including four in 
      known disease genes, and one repeat expansion in HOXD13. In three unrelated cases 
      with ectrodactyly, we identified likely pathogenic variants in UBA2, establishing 
      it as a novel disease gene. In addition, we found two complex structural variants 
      (3%). We also identified likely causative variants in three novel high confidence 
      candidate genes. We were not able to identify any noncoding variants. GS is a 
      powerful strategy to identify all types of genomic variants associated with 
      congenital limb malformation, including repeat expansions and complex structural 
      variants missed by standard diagnostic approaches. In this cohort, no causative 
      noncoding SNVs could be identified.

TI  - A Systemic Protein Deviation Score Linked to PD-1(+) CD8(+) T Cell Expansion That 
      Predicts Overall Survival in Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Current prognostic variables can only partly explain the large 
      outcome heterogeneity in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We aimed to 
      investigate the utility of systems-level protein and immune repertoire profiling 
      for outcome prognostication in DLBCL. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we 
      used proximity extension assay technology to quantify 81 immune-related proteins 
      in serum or plasma in 2 independent cohorts in a total 111 DLBCL patients. 
      Protein levels were assessed before and after treatment with rituximab and 
      chemotherapy, and the patients were compared with 19 age- and sex-matched healthy 
      blood donors. In a subset of the patients, we performed a broad mass cytometric 
      characterization of immune cell repertoires in peripheral blood. FINDINGS: 
      Patients displayed large deviations in protein profiles compared with healthy 
      controls. Development of a systemic protein deviation (SPD) score provided a 
      4-protein-based metric that reflected the overall degree of protein deviations 
      compared with age- and sex-matched healthy blood donors. The SPD score identified 
      patients with very poor overall survival in both cohorts and correlated with 
      increased frequencies of peripheral blood PD-1(+) CD8(+) T cells, and expansion 
      of myeloid-derived suppressor cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that a simple 
      metric based on measurement of a small set of serum or plasma proteins can be 
      used to probe systemic immune changes associated with poor survival in DLBCL. 
      This finding warrants further investigation in larger, prospective studies to 
      establish a clinical prognostic biomarker.

AB  - The grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) is a promising nonhuman primate model 
      for brain ageing and neurodegenerative diseases. Age-related cognitive decline in 
      this model is well described, however, data on possible relations between 
      attention and age, as they are known from humans, are missing. We tested 10 mouse 
      lemurs in a touchscreen-based version of the 5-choice-serial-reaction-time-task 
      (5CSRTT) on visuo-spatial attention: subjects had to interact with a briefly 
      presented stimulus occurring unpredictably in one out of five locations on the 
      touchscreen. Animals were trained to an 80 % performance at a four seconds 
      stimulus presentation duration (SPD) and subsequently challenged by a SPD of two 
      seconds. Additionally, ventricular expansion was assessed using structural 
      magnetic resonance imaging. Trials to the 80 % criterion at four seconds SPD 
      correlated significantly with age and with ventricular expansion, especially 
      around the occipital lobe. Once criterion performance was reached, two seconds 
      challenge performance was independent of age. In four subjects that were 
      additionally challenged with 1.5, 1.0, 0.8, or 0.6 s SPDs or variable delays 
      preceding stimulus presentation, performance linearly declined with decreasing 
      SPD, i.e. increasing attentional demand. In conclusion, this is the first report 
      of 5CSRTT data in mouse lemurs and demonstrates the general applicability of this 
      task of visuo-spatial attention to this nonhuman primate model. Results further 
      demonstrate age-related deficits in learning during acquisition of the 5CSRTT and 
      suggest that both may be linked through age-related atrophy of occipital 
      structures and a resulting deficit in central visual processes.

TI  - TLR2/6 signaling promotes the expansion of premalignant hematopoietic stem and 
      progenitor cells in the NUP98-HOXD13 mouse model of MDS.
PG  - 42-55

AB  - Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) expression is increased on hematopoietic stem and 
      progenitor cells (HSPCs) of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and 
      enhanced TLR2 signaling is thought to contribute to MDS pathogenesis. Notably, 
      TLR2 heterodimerizes with TLR1 or TLR6, and while high TLR2 is associated with 
      lower-risk disease, high TLR6, but not TLR1, correlates with higher-risk disease. 
      This raises the possibility of heterodimer-specific effects of TLR2 signaling in 
      MDS, and in the work described here, we tested the effects of specific modulation 
      of TLR1/2 versus TLR2/6 signaling on premalignant HSPCs. Indeed, chronic 
      stimulation of TLR2/6, but not TLR1/2, accelerates leukemic transformation in the 
      NHD13 mouse model of MDS, and conversely, loss of TLR6, but not TLR1, slows this 
      process. TLR2/6 stimulation expands premalignant HSPCs, and chimeric mouse 
      studies revealed that cell-autonomous signaling contributes to this expansion. 
      Finally, TLR2/6 stimulation is associated with an enrichment of Myc and mTORC1 
      activities. While Myc inhibition partially suppressed the TLR2/6 agonist-mediated 
      expansion of premalignant HSPCs, inhibition of mTORC1 exacerbated it, suggesting 
      that these pathways play opposite roles in regulating the effects of TLR2/6

      TLR2 signaling on premalignant HSPCs, with TLR2/6 signaling promoting their 
      expansion and leukemic transformation.

AB  - Expansions of amino acid repeats occur in >20 inherited human disorders, and many 
      occur in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of transcription factors (TFs). 
      Such diseases are associated with protein aggregation, but the contribution of 
      aggregates to pathology has been controversial. Here, we report that alanine 
      repeat expansions in the HOXD13 TF, which cause hereditary synpolydactyly in 
      humans, alter its phase separation capacity and its capacity to co-condense with 
      transcriptional co-activators. HOXD13 repeat expansions perturb the composition 
      of HOXD13-containing condensates in vitro and in vivo and alter the 
      transcriptional program in a cell-specific manner in a mouse model of 
      synpolydactyly. Disease-associated repeat expansions in other TFs (HOXA13, RUNX2, 
      and TBP) were similarly found to alter their phase separation. These results 
      suggest that unblending of transcriptional condensates may underlie human 
      pathologies. We present a molecular classification of TF IDRs, which provides a 
      framework to dissect TF function in diseases associated with transcriptional 
      dysregulation.

TI  - Genetic polymorphisms of surfactant protein D rs2243639, Interleukin (IL)-1beta 
      rs16944 and IL-1RN rs2234663 in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, healthy 
      smokers, and non-smokers.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a 
      complex chronic inflammatory disease that involves the activity of various 
      inflammatory cells and mediators. It has been suggested that susceptibility to 
      COPD is, at least in part, genetically determined. The primary aim of this study 
      was to investigate the association between surfactant protein D (SFTPD) 
      rs2243639, interleukin (IL)-1beta rs16944 and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RN) 
      rs2234663 gene polymorphisms and COPD susceptibility, as well as examining the 
      association between the various IL-1RN/IL-1beta haplotypes and pulmonary function 
      tests (PFT). Secondly, we aimed to examine the influence of SFTPD rs2243639 
      polymorphism on serum surfactant protein D (SP-D) level. METHODS: A total of 114 
      subjects were recruited in this study and divided into three groups: 63 COPD 
      patients, 25 asymptomatic smokers, and 26 healthy controls. Polymerase chain 
      reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was performed for 
      the detection of SFTPD rs2243639 and IL-1beta rs16944 polymorphisms. Detection of 
      variable numbers of an 86-bp tandem repeat (VNTR) of IL-1RN was done using PCR. 
      Serum SP-D level was measured using enzyme linked-immunosorbent assay. PFTs were 
      measured by spirometry. RESULTS: Carriers of the SFTPD AG and AA polymorphic 
      genotypes constituted 71.4 % of COPD patients versus 48 % in asymptomatic 
      smokers, with a statistically significant difference between the two groups 
      (p = 0.049). Smokers who were carriers of the polymorphic SFTPD rs2243639 A 
      allele (AG and AA genotypes) have a 2.708 times risk of developing COPD when 
      compared with wild-type GG genotype carriers [odds ratio (OR) 2.708 (95 % CI 
      1.041-7.047)]. Forced expiratory flow (FEF) 25-75 % predicted was higher in 
      IL-1RN*1/*1 when compared with *1/*2 (p = 0.013). FEF25-75 % predicted in 
      carriers of haplotype IL-1RN *1/IL-1beta T (49.21 +/- 10.26) was statistically 
      significantly higher than in carriers of IL-1RN *2/IL-1beta T (39.67 +/- 12.64) 
      [p = 0.005]. Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) 
      in carriers of haplotype IL-1RN *1/IL-1beta T (64.09 +/- 6.39) was statistically 
      significantly higher than in carriers of IL-1RN *2/IL-1betaT (59.44 +/- 7.71) 
      [p = 0.048]. There was no association between SFTPD rs2243639 genotypes and serum 
      SP-D level. CONCLUSIONS: Smokers who are carriers of the SFTPD AG and AA 
      polymorphic genotypes may be at a higher risk of developing COPD when compared 
      with wild-type GG genotype carriers. IL-1RN rs2234663/IL-1beta rs16944 haplotypes 
      influence FEF25-75 % predicted and FEV1/FVC. SFTPD rs2243639 polymorphism did not 
      influence serum SP-D levels in our group of recruited subjects.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: To assess HRQL in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and 
      investigate the relevant factors. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional three-center 
      study involving 407 inpatients with CHB was conducted. Subjects completed the 
      epidemiological questionnaire and two validated questionnaires (SF-36 and 
      QLICD-CH). Afterwards, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion 
      (I/D) and dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) gene polymorphisms were assessed in all 
      patients. RESULTS: It was found that the scores of CHB patients in SF-36 scale 8 
      domains were lower than those of the normal population (all p<0.001). The 
      anti-viral therapy could improve four-area-scores (PHD (p=0.004), SOD (p=0.011), 
      SPD (p=0.032), TOT (p=0.014)). Extraverted personality, social competence and 
      ability to work were protective factors of HRQL, while severity of illness, 
      better family economy and abnormal condition of liver function were risk factors. 
      The scores in II genotype were higher than those in I/D+DD genotype of ACE 
      polymorphisms. The scores in short repeat sequences genotypes were higher than 
      those in long repeat sequences genotype of DRD4 polymorphisms. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Patients with CHB had lower HRQL than normal population. Anti-viral treatments 
      can improve their HRQL. Several health factors independently influence HRQL and 
      ACE and DRD4 gene polymorphism is associated with HRQL of CHB patients.

TI  - A NUP98-HOXD13 fusion gene impairs differentiation of B and T lymphocytes and 
      leads to expansion of thymocytes with partial TCRB gene rearrangement.
PG  - 6227-35
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.0901121 [doi]
AB  - Expression of a NUP98-HOXD13 (NHD13) fusion gene leads to myelodysplastic 
      syndrome in mice. In addition to ineffective hematopoiesis, we observed that 
      NHD13 mice were lymphopenic; the lymphopenia was due to a decrease in both T and 
      B lymphocytes. Although the pro-B cell (B220(+)/CD43(+)) populations from the 
      NHD13 and wild-type mice were similar, the NHD13 mice showed decreased pre-B 
      cells (B220(+)/CD43(-)), indicating impaired differentiation at the pro-B to 
      pre-B stage. Thymi from NHD13 mice were smaller and overexpressed Hoxa cluster 
      genes, including Hoxa7, Hoxa9, and Hoxa10. In addition, the NHD13 thymi contained 
      fewer thymocytes, with an increased percentage of CD4(-)/CD8(-) (double-negative 
      (DN)) cells and a decreased percentage of CD4(+)/CD8(+) (double-positive) cells; 
      the DN1/DN2 population was increased and the DN3/DN4 population was decreased, 
      suggesting a partial block at the DN2 to DN3 transition. To determine clonality 
      of the thymocytes, we used degenerate RT-PCR to identify clonal Tcrb gene 
      rearrangements. Five of six NHD13 thymi showed an unusual Tcrb gene rearrangement 
      pattern with common, clonal DJ rearrangements, but distinct V-D junctions, 
      suggesting a marked clonal expansion of thymocytes that had undergone a DJ 
      rearrangement, but not completed a VDJ rearrangement. Taken together, these 
      findings demonstrate that expression of the NHD13 transgene inhibits lymphoid as 
      well as myeloid and erythroid differentiation, results in overexpression of Hoxa 
      cluster genes, and leads to a precursor T cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma.

TI  - Fork stalling and template switching as a mechanism for polyalanine tract 
      expansion affecting the DYC mutant of HOXD13, a new murine model of 
      synpolydactyly.
PG  - 23-30
LID - 10.1534/genetics.109.104695 [doi]
AB  - Polyalanine expansion diseases are proposed to result from unequal crossover of 
      sister chromatids that increases the number of repeats. In this report we suggest 
      an alternative mechanism we put forward while we investigated a new spontaneous 
      mutant that we named "Dyc" for "Digit in Y and Carpe" phenotype. Phenotypic 
      analysis revealed an abnormal limb patterning similar to that of the human 
      inherited congenital disease synpolydactyly (SPD) and to the mouse mutant model 
      Spdh. Both human SPD and mouse Spdh mutations affect the Hoxd13 gene within a 
      15-residue polyalanine-encoding repeat in the first exon of the gene, leading to 
      a dominant negative HOXD13. Genetic analysis of the Dyc mutant revealed a 
      trinucleotide expansion in the polyalanine-encoding region of the Hoxd13 gene 
      resulting in a 7-alanine expansion. However, unlike the Spdh mutation, this 
      expansion cannot result from a simple duplication of a short segment. Instead, we 
      propose the fork stalling and template switching (FosTeS) described for 
      generation of nonrecurrent genomic rearrangements as a possible mechanism for the 
      Dyc polyalanine extension, as well as for other polyalanine expansions described 
      in the literature and that could not be explained by unequal crossing over.

TI  - Recombinant surfactant protein-D selectively increases apoptosis in eosinophils 
      of allergic asthmatics and enhances uptake of apoptotic eosinophils by 
      macrophages.
PG  - 993-1007
LID - 10.1093/intimm/dxn058 [doi]
AB  - Pulmonary surfactant protein-D (SP-D) is a multifunctional, pattern recognition 
      molecule involved in resistance to allergen challenge and pulmonary inflammation. 
      In view of therapeutic effects of exogenous SP-D or recombinant fragment of human 
      surfactant protein-D (rhSP-D) (composed of eight Gly-X-Y collagen repeat 
      sequences, homotrimeric neck and lectin domains) in murine models of lung allergy 
      and hypereosinophilic SP-D gene-deficient mice, we investigated the possibility 
      of a direct interaction of purified rhSP-D with human eosinophils derived from 
      allergic patients and healthy donors. rhSP-D showed a sugar- and 
      calcium-dependent binding to human eosinophils, suggesting involvement of its 
      carbohydrate recognition domain. While eosinophils from allergic patients showed 
      a significant increase in apoptosis, oxidative burst and CD69 expression in 
      presence of rhSP-D, eosinophils from healthy donors showed no significant change. 
      However, these eosinophils from healthy donors when primed with IL-5 exhibited 
      increase in apoptosis on incubation with rhSP-D. Apoptosis mediated by rhSP-D in 
      primed eosinophils was not affected by the antioxidant, N-acetyl-L-cysteine. 
      There was a manifold increase in binding of rhSP-D to apoptotic eosinophils than 
      the normal eosinophils and rhSP-D induced a significant increase in uptake of 
      apoptotic eosinophils by J774A.1 macrophage cells. The study suggests that rhSP-D 
      mediated preferential increase of apoptosis of primed eosinophils while not 
      affecting the normal eosinophils and increased phagocytosis of apoptotic 
      eosinophils may be important mechanisms of rhSP-D and plausibly SP-D-mediated 
      resolution of allergic eosinophilic inflammation in vivo.

TI  - Molecular characterization of HOXA13 polyalanine expansion proteins in 
      hand-foot-genital syndrome.
PG  - 3161-8
AB  - We report on a father and daughter with hand-foot-genital syndrome (HFGS) with 
      typical skeletal and genitourinary anomalies due to a 14-residue polyalanine 
      expansion in HOXA13. This is the largest (32 residues) polyalanine tract so far 
      described for any polyalanine mutant protein. Polyalanine expansion results in 
      protein misfolding, cytoplasmic aggregation and degradation; however, HOXA13 
      polyalanine expansions appear to act as loss of function mutations in contrast to 
      gain of function for HOXD13 polyalanine expansions. To address this paradox we 
      examined the cellular consequences of polyalanine expansions on HOXA13 protein 
      using COS cell transfection and immunocytochemistry. HOXA13 polyalanine expansion 
      proteins form cytoplasmic aggregates, and distribution between cytoplasmic 
      aggregates or the nucleus is polyalanine tract size-dependent. Geldanamycin, an 
      Hsp90 inhibitor, reduces the steady-state abundance of all polyalanine-expanded 
      proteins in transfected cells. We also found that wild-type HOXA13 or HOXD13 
      proteins are sequestered in HOXA13 polyalanine expansion cytoplasmic aggregates. 
      Thus, the difference between HOXA13 polyalanine expansion loss-of-function and 
      HOXD13 polyalanine expansion dominant-negative effect is not the ability to 
      aggregate wild-type group 13 paralogs but perhaps to variation in activities 
      associated with refolding, aggregation or degradation of the proteins.

TI  - HOXD13 polyalanine tract expansion in classical synpolydactyly type Vordingborg.
PG  - 116-21
AB  - In 1927, Oluf Thomsen, in a classic paper, described a seven-generation family 
      with autosomal dominant axial synpolydactyly (SPD)--the Vordingborgtyp of axis 
      duplication and dysostosis. Expansion of a polyalanine tract in the HOXD13 gene 
      is known to cause synpolydactyly. We have rediscovered part of the family 
      described by Thomsen, and detected a 9 triplet polyalanine expansion within 
      HOXD13segregating with the disorder. The phenotypic spectrum in mutation carriers 
      ranged from severe to inapparent bone malformations. In the latter case, only 
      dermatoglyphics revealed the genetic status.

TI  - The mouse Hoxd13(spdh) mutation, a polyalanine expansion similar to human type II 
      synpolydactyly (SPD), disrupts the function but not the expression of other Hoxd 
      genes.
PG  - 345-53
AB  - Polyalanine expansion in the human HOXD13 gene induces synpolydactyly (SPD), an 
      inherited congenital limb malformation. A mouse model was isolated, which showed 
      a spontaneous alanine expansion due to a 21-bp duplication at the corresponding 
      place in the mouse gene. This mutation (synpolydactyly homolog, spdh), when 
      homozygous, causes malformations in mice similar to those seen in affected human 
      patients. We have studied the genetics of this condition, by using several 
      engineered Hoxd alleles, as well as by looking at the expression of Hox and other 
      marker genes. We show that the mutated SPDH protein induces a gain-of-function 
      phenotype, likely by behaving as a dominant negative over other Hox genes. The 
      mutation, however, seems to act independently from Hoxa13 and doesn't appear to 
      affect Hox gene expression, except for a slight reduction of the HOXD13 protein 
      itself. Developmental studies indicate that the morphological effect is mostly 
      due to a severe retardation in the growth and ossification of the bony elements, 
      in agreement with a general impairment in the function of posterior Hoxd genes.
