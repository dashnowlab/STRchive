TI  - RFC1 and FGF14 Repeat Expansions in Serbian Patients with Cerebellar Ataxia.
LID - 10.1002/mdc3.14020 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The newly discovered intronic repeat expansions in the genes encoding 
      replication factor C subunit 1 (RFC1) and fibroblast growth factor 14 (FGF14) 
      frequently cause late-onset cerebellar ataxia. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the 
      presence of RFC1 and FGF14 pathogenic repeat expansions in Serbian patients with 
      adult-onset cerebellar ataxia. METHODS: The study included 167 unrelated patients 
      with sporadic or familial cerebellar ataxia. The RFC1 repeat expansion analysis 
      was performed by duplex PCR and Sanger sequencing, while the FGF14 repeat 
      expansion was tested for by long-range PCR, repeat-primed PCR, and Sanger 
      sequencing. RESULTS: We identified pathogenic repeat expansions in RFC1 in seven 
      patients (7/167; 4.2%) with late-onset sporadic ataxia with neuropathy and 
      chronic cough. Two patients also had bilateral vestibulopathy. Repeat expansions 
      in FGF14 were found in nine unrelated patients (9/167; 5.4%) with ataxia, less 
      than half of whom presented with neuropathy and two-thirds with global brain 
      atrophy. Tremor and episodic features were the most frequent additional 
      characteristics in carriers of uninterrupted FGF14 repeat expansions. Among the 
      122 sporadic cases, 12 (9.8%) carried an expansion in either RFC1 or FGF14, 
      comparable to 4/45 (8.9%) among the patients with a positive family history. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Pathogenic repeat expansions in RFC1 and FGF14 are relatively 
      frequent causes of adult-onset cerebellar ataxia, especially among sporadic 
      patients, indicating that family history should not be considered when 
      prioritizing ataxia patients for testing of RFC1 or FGF14 repeat expansions.

AB  - There are cases in which CKD progression is difficult to evaluate, because the 
      changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and proteinuria sometimes 
      show opposite directions as CKD progresses. Indices and models that enable the 
      easy and accurate risk prediction of end-stage-kidney disease (ESKD) are 
      indispensable to CKD therapy. In this study, we investigated whether a CKD stage 
      coordinate transformed into a vector field (CKD potential model) accurately 
      predicts ESKD risk. Meta-analysis of large-scale cohort studies of CKD patients 
      in PubMed was conducted to develop the model. The distance from CKD stage G2 A1 
      to a patient's data on eGFR and proteinuria was defined as r. We developed the 
      CKD potential model on the basis of the data from the meta-analysis of three 
      previous cohort studies: ESKD risk = exp(r). Then, the model was validated using 
      data from a cohort study of CKD patients in Japan followed up for three years (n 
      = 1,564). Moreover, the directional derivative of the model was developed as an 
      index of CKD progression velocity. For ESKD prediction in three years, areas 
      under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were adjusted for 
      baseline characteristics. Cox proportional hazards models with spline terms 
      showed the exponential association between r and ESKD risk (p<0.0001). The CKD 
      potential model more accurately predicted ESKD with an adjusted AUC of 0.81 (95% 
      CI 0.76, 0.87) than eGFR (p<0.0001). Moreover, the directional derivative of the 
      model showed a larger adjusted AUC for the prediction of ESKD than the percent 
      eGFR change and eGFR slope (p<0.0001). Then, a chart of the transformed CKD stage 
      was developed for implementation in clinical settings. This study indicated that 
      the transformed CKD stage as a vector field enables the easy and accurate 
      estimation of ESKD risk and CKD progression and suggested that vector analysis is 
      a useful tool for clinical studies of CKD and its related diseases.

AB  - Short tandem repeats are inherently unstable during DNA replication depending on 
      repeat length, and the expansion of the repeat length in the human genome is 
      responsible for repeat expansion disorders. Pentanucleotide AAGGG and ACAGG 
      repeat expansions in intron 2 of the gene encoding replication factor C subunit 1 
      (RFC1) cause cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, vestibular areflexia syndrome 
      (CANVAS) and other phenotypes of late-onset cerebellar ataxia. Herein, we reveal 
      the structural polymorphism of the RFC1 repeats associated with CANVAS in vitro. 
      Single-stranded AAGGG repeat DNA formed a hybrid-type G-quadruplex, whereas its 
      RNA formed a parallel-type G-quadruplex with three layers. The RNA of the ACAGG 
      repeat formed hairpin structure comprising C-G and G-C base pairs with A:A and 
      GA:AG mismatched repeats. Furthermore, both pathogenic repeat RNAs formed more 
      rigid structures than those of the nonpathogenic repeat RNAs. These findings 
      provide novel insights into the structural polymorphism of the RFC1 repeats, 
      which may be closely related to the disease mechanism of CANVAS.

TI  - Pathogenic CANVAS (AAGGG)n repeats stall DNA replication due to the formation of 
      alternative DNA structures.
LID - gkae124 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkae124 [doi]
AB  - CANVAS is a recently characterized repeat expansion disease, most commonly caused 
      by homozygous expansions of an intronic (A2G3)n repeat in the RFC1 gene. There 
      are a multitude of repeat motifs found in the human population at this locus, 
      some of which are pathogenic and others benign. In this study, we conducted 
      structure-functional analyses of the pathogenic (A2G3)n and nonpathogenic (A4G)n 
      repeats. We found that the pathogenic, but not the nonpathogenic, repeat presents 
      a potent, orientation-dependent impediment to DNA polymerization in vitro. The 
      pattern of the polymerization blockage is consistent with triplex or quadruplex 
      formation in the presence of magnesium or potassium ions, respectively. Chemical 
      probing of both repeats in vitro reveals triplex H-DNA formation by only the 
      pathogenic repeat. Consistently, bioinformatic analysis of S1-END-seq data from 
      human cell lines shows preferential H-DNA formation genome-wide by (A2G3)n motifs 
      over (A4G)n motifs. Finally, the pathogenic, but not the nonpathogenic, repeat 
      stalls replication fork progression in yeast and human cells. We hypothesize that 
      the CANVAS-causing (A2G3)n repeat represents a challenge to genome stability by 
      folding into alternative DNA structures that stall DNA replication.

TI  - RFC1 repeat expansions in downbeat nystagmus syndromes: frequency and phenotypic 
      profile.
LID - 10.1007/s00415-024-12229-z [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The cause of downbeat nystagmus (DBN) remains unknown in a 
      substantial number of patients ("idiopathic"), although intronic GAA expansions 
      in FGF14 have recently been shown to account for almost 50% of yet idiopathic 
      cases. Here, we hypothesized that biallelic RFC1 expansions may also represent a 
      recurrent cause of DBN syndrome. METHODS: We genotyped the RFC1 repeat and 
      performed in-depth phenotyping in 203 patients with DBN, including 65 patients 
      with idiopathic DBN, 102 patients carrying an FGF14 GAA expansion, and 36 
      patients with presumed secondary DBN. RESULTS: Biallelic RFC1 AAGGG expansions 
      were identified in 15/65 patients with idiopathic DBN (23%). None of the 102 
      GAA-FGF14-positive patients, but 2/36 (6%) of patients with presumed secondary 
      DBN carried biallelic RFC1 expansions. The DBN syndrome in RFC1-positive patients 
      was characterized by additional cerebellar impairment in 100% (15/15), bilateral 
      vestibulopathy (BVP) in 100% (15/15), and polyneuropathy in 80% (12/15) of cases. 
      Compared to GAA-FGF14-positive and genetically unexplained patients, 
      RFC1-positive patients had significantly more frequent neuropathic features on 
      examination and BVP. Furthermore, vestibular function, as measured by the video 
      head impulse test, was significantly more impaired in RFC1-positive patients. 
      DISCUSSION: Biallelic RFC1 expansions are a common monogenic cause of DBN 
      syndrome.

TI  - Comprehensive Analysis of a Japanese Pedigree with Biallelic ACAGG Expansions in 
      RFC1 Manifesting Motor Neuronopathy with Painful Muscle Cramps.
LID - 10.1007/s12311-024-01666-1 [doi]
AB  - Cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) is an 
      autosomal recessive multisystem neurologic disorder caused by biallelic intronic 
      repeats in RFC1. Although the phenotype of CANVAS has been expanding via 
      diagnostic case accumulation, there are scant pedigree analyses to reveal disease 
      penetrance, intergenerational fluctuations in repeat length, or clinical 
      phenomena (including heterozygous carriers). We identified biallelic RFC1 ACAGG 
      expansions of 1000 ~ repeats in three affected siblings having sensorimotor 
      neuronopathy with spinocerebellar atrophy initially presenting with painful 
      muscle cramps and paroxysmal dry cough. They exhibit almost homogeneous clinical 
      and histopathological features, indicating motor neuronopathy. Over 10 years of 
      follow-up, painful intractable muscle cramps ascended from legs to trunks and 
      hands, followed by amyotrophy and subsequent leg pyramidal signs. The disease 
      course combined with the electrophysical and imagery data suggest initial and 
      prolonged hyperexcitability and the ensuing spinal motor neuron loss, which may 
      progress from the lumbar to the rostral anterior horns and later expand to the 
      corticospinal tract. Genetically, heterozygous ACAGG expansions of similar length 
      were transmitted in unaffected family members of three successive generations, 
      and some of them experienced muscle cramps. Leukocyte telomere length assays 
      revealed comparatively shorter telomeres in affected individuals. This 
      comprehensive pedigree analysis demonstrated a non-anticipating ACAGG 
      transmission and high penetrance of manifestations with a biallelic state, 
      especially motor neuronopathy in which muscle cramps serve as a prodromal and 
      disease progress marker. CANVAS and RFC1 spectrum disorder should be considered 
      when diagnosing lower dominant motor neuron disease, idiopathic muscle cramps, or 
      neuromuscular hyperexcitability syndromes.

TI  - The impact of folate pathway variants on the outcome of methotrexate therapy in 
      rheumatoid arthritis patients.
PG  - 971-983
LID - 10.1007/s10067-024-06892-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are currently no validated criteria that entirely explain or 
      predict response to methotrexate (MTX) treatment in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We 
      tried to identify the connection between three variants (RFC1 G80A (rs1051266), 
      TYMS 2R/3R (rs34743033), and ATIC C347G (rs2372536)) in the folate pathway of MTX 
      metabolism and the response to MTX monotherapy in a cohort of RA cases. METHODS: 
      A prospective study on 100 RA patients on MTX monotherapy was performed. Disease 
      activity was measured at the start of treatment and 6 months after treatment with 
      MTX. The patients were then split into two groups: those who responded to the 
      treatment and those who did not. The molecular genetic study for the RFC1 (G80A) 
      variant was employed via the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism 
      (PCR-RFLP) technique, the ATIC (C347G) variant was performed using TaqMan allelic 
      discrimination real-time PCR, and the tandem repeat sequences of TYMS (2R/3R) 
      were amplified by conventional PCR and detected by agarose gel electrophoresis. 
      RESULTS: The genotype distribution of RFC-1 (G80A) showed significant variations 
      among non-responders and responders in the recessive genetic model. A significant 
      difference was found in TYMS (2R/3R) in the dominant and heterozygous genetic 
      models. However, ATIC (C347G) genotype frequency did not exhibit substantial link 
      with drug response in all genetic models. Furthermore, the genotype and allele 
      rates of the analyzed variants did not show any significant association with 
      adverse events in all genetic models. CONCLUSION: The 80AA genotype of RFC-1 G80A 
      and the 2R/3R or 3R/3R genotypes of TYMS 2R/3R are more vulnerable to the good 
      consequences of MTX therapy. Key Points * Current recommendations support the 
      gold standard role of MTX as a first-line monotherapy for RA patients. However, 
      up to 40% of RA patients do not respond or exhibit partial response to MTX. * 
      Persistent disease activity due to treatment unresponsiveness will affect the 
      long-term outcomes in RA patients. * We aimed, through molecular genetic study, 
      to identify the connection between three variants in the folate pathway of MTX 
      metabolism and the response to methotrexate monotherapy in a cohort of RA 
      patients.

AB  - A 56-year-old man was born to consanguineous parents. He experienced 
      slow-progressing sensory disturbances in the upper extremities. T1-weighted 
      images showed cerebellar atrophy. 123I-IMP SPECT revealed reduced cerebral blood 
      flow in the cerebellum. 123I-FP-CIT SPECT showed low uptake of dopamine 
      transporter in the bilateral tail of the striatum. 123I-MIBG scintigraphy shows a 
      decreased heart-to-mediastinum ratio. Flanking polymerase chain reaction 
      suggested biallelic repeat expansion in intron 2 of RFC1, and subsequent 
      repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction revealed ACAGG repeat expansion. Thus, he 
      was diagnosed as cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and vestibular areflexia 
      syndrome.

TI  - Structural investigation of pathogenic RFC1 AAGGG pentanucleotide repeats reveals 
      a role of G-quadruplex in dysregulated gene expression in CANVAS.
PG  - 2698-2710
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkae032 [doi]
AB  - An expansion of AAGGG pentanucleotide repeats in the replication factor C subunit 
      1 (RFC1) gene is the genetic cause of cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and 
      vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS), and it also links to several other 
      neurodegenerative diseases including the Parkinson's disease. However, the 
      pathogenic mechanism of RFC1 AAGGG repeat expansion remains enigmatic. Here, we 
      report that the pathogenic RFC1 AAGGG repeats form DNA and RNA parallel 
      G-quadruplex (G4) structures that play a role in impairing biological processes. 
      We determine the first high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure 
      of a bimolecular parallel G4 formed by d(AAGGG)2AA and reveal how AAGGG repeats 
      fold into a higher-order structure composed of three G-tetrad layers, and further 
      demonstrate the formation of intramolecular G4s in longer DNA and RNA repeats. 
      The pathogenic AAGGG repeats, but not the nonpathogenic AAAAG repeats, form G4 
      structures to stall DNA replication and reduce gene expression via impairing the 
      translation process in a repeat-length-dependent manner. Our results provide an 
      unprecedented structural basis for understanding the pathogenic mechanism of 
      AAGGG repeat expansion associated with CANVAS. In addition, the high-resolution 
      structures resolved in this study will facilitate rational design of 
      small-molecule ligands and helicases targeting G4s formed by AAGGG repeats for 
      therapeutic interventions.

TI  - Role of the repeat expansion size in predicting age of onset and severity in RFC1 
      disease.

AB  - RFC1 disease, caused by biallelic repeat expansion in RFC1, is clinically 
      heterogeneous in terms of age of onset, disease progression and phenotype. We 
      investigated the role of the repeat size in influencing clinical variables in 
      RFC1 disease. We also assessed the presence and role of meiotic and somatic 
      instability of the repeat. In this study, we identified 553 patients carrying 
      biallelic RFC1 expansions and measured the repeat expansion size in 392 cases. 
      Pearson's coefficient was calculated to assess the correlation between the repeat 
      size and age at disease onset. A Cox model with robust cluster standard errors 
      was adopted to describe the effect of repeat size on age at disease onset, on age 
      at onset of each individual symptoms, and on disease progression. A quasi-poisson 
      regression model was used to analyse the relationship between phenotype and 
      repeat size. We performed multi-variate linear regression to assess the 
      association of the repeat size with the degree of cerebellar atrophy. Meiotic 
      stability was assessed by Southern blotting on first-degree relatives of 27 
      probands. Finally, somatic instability was investigated by optical genome mapping 
      on cerebellar and frontal cortex and unaffected peripheral tissue from four 
      post-mortem cases. A larger repeat size of both smaller and larger allele was 
      associated with an earlier age at neurological onset (smaller allele HR = 2.06, 
      p < 0.001; larger allele HR = 1.53, p < 0.001) and with a higher hazard of 
      developing disabling symptoms, such as dysarthria or dysphagia (smaller allele 
      HR = 3.40, p < 0.001; larger allele HR = 1.71, p = 0.002) or loss of independent 
      walking (smaller allele HR = 2.78, p < 0.001; larger allele HR = 1.60; p < 0.001) 
      earlier in disease course. Patients with more complex phenotypes carried larger 
      expansions (smaller allele: complex neuropathy RR = 1.30, p = 0.003; CANVAS 
      RR = 1.34, p < 0.001; larger allele: complex neuropathy RR = 1.33, p = 0.008; 
      CANVAS RR = 1.31, p = 0.009). Furthermore, larger repeat expansions in the 
      smaller allele were associated with more pronounced cerebellar vermis atrophy 
      (lobules I-V beta=-1.06, p < 0.001; lobules VI-VII beta=-0.34, p = 0.005). The repeat 
      did not show significant instability during vertical transmission and across 
      different tissues and brain regions. RFC1 repeat size, particularly of the 
      smaller allele, is one of the determinants of variability in RFC1 disease and 
      represents a key prognostic factor to predict disease onset, phenotype, and 
      severity. Assessing the repeat size is warranted as part of the diagnostic test 
      for RFC1 expansion.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hereditary ataxias (HAs) encompass a diverse and genetically 
      intricate group of rare neurodegenerative disorders, presenting diagnostic 
      challenges. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) has significantly improved diagnostic 
      success. This study aimed to elucidate genetic causes of cerebellar ataxia within 
      a diverse Brazilian cohort. METHODS: Biological samples were collected from 
      individuals with sporadic or familial cerebellar ataxia, spanning various ages 
      and phenotypes, excluding common SCAs and Friedreich ataxia. RFC1 biallelic AAGGG 
      repeat expansion was screened in all patients. For AAGGG-negative cases, WES 
      targeting 441 ataxia-related genes was performed, followed by ExpansionHunter 
      analysis for repeat expansions, including the recently described GGC-ZFHX3. 
      Variant classification adhered to ClinGen guidelines, yielding definitive or 
      probable diagnoses. RESULTS: The study involved 76 diverse Brazilian families. 
      16 % received definitive diagnoses, and another 16 % received probable ones. 
      RFC1-related ataxia was predominant, with two definitive cases, followed by KIF1A 
      (one definitive and one probable) and SYNE-1 (two probable). Early-onset cases 
      exhibited higher diagnostic rates. ExpansionHunter improved diagnosis by 4 %.We 
      did not detected GGC-ZFHX3 repeat expansion in this cohort. CONCLUSION: This 
      study highlights diagnostic complexities in cerebellar ataxia, even with advanced 
      genetic methods. RFC1, KIF1A, and SYNE1 emerged as prevalent mutations. ZFHX3 
      repeat expansion seem to be rare in Brazilian population. Early-onset cases 
      showed higher diagnostic success. WES coupled with ExpansionHunter holds promise 
      as a primary diagnostic tool, emphasizing the need for broader NGS accessibility 
      in Brazil.

AB  - Cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) is a 
      late-onset, autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder caused by biallelic 
      AAGGG/ACAGG repeat expansion (AAGGG-exp/ACAGG-exp) in RFC1. The recent 
      identification of patients with CANVAS exhibiting compound heterozygosity for 
      AAGGG-exp and truncating variants supports the loss-of-function of RFC1 in CANVAS 
      patients. We investigated the pathological changes in 2 autopsied patients with 
      CANVAS harboring biallelic ACAGG-exp and AAGGG-exp. RNA fluorescence in situ 
      hybridization of the 2 patients revealed CCTGT- and CCCTT-containing RNA foci, 
      respectively, in neuronal nuclei of tissues with neuronal loss. Our findings 
      suggest that RNA toxicity may be involved in the pathogenesis of CANVAS. ANN

AB  - BACKGROUND: Biallelic intronic AAGGG repeat expansions in the replication factor 
      complex subunit 1 (RFC1) gene were identified as the leading cause of cerebellar 
      ataxia, neuropathy, vestibular areflexia syndrome. Patients exhibit significant 
      clinical heterogeneity and variable disease course, but no potential biomarker 
      has been identified to date. OBJECTIVES: In this multicenter cross-sectional 
      study, we aimed to evaluate neurofilament light (NfL) chain serum levels in a 
      cohort of RFC1 disease patients and to correlate NfL serum concentrations with 
      clinical phenotype and disease severity. METHODS: Sixty-one patients with 
      genetically confirmed RFC1 disease and 48 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled 
      from six neurological centers. Serum NfL concentration was measured using the 
      single molecule array assay technique. RESULTS: Serum NfL concentration was 
      significantly higher in patients with RFC1 disease compared to age- 
      and-sex-matched HCs (P < 0.0001). NfL level showed a moderate correlation with 
      age in both HCs (r = 0.4353, P = 0.0020) and patients (r = 0.4092, P = 0.0011). 
      Mean NfL concentration appeared to be significantly higher in patients with 
      cerebellar involvement compared to patients without cerebellar dysfunction (27.88 
      vs. 21.84 pg/mL, P = 0.0081). The association between cerebellar involvement and 
      NfL remained significant after controlling for age and sex (beta = 0.260, 
      P = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS: Serum NfL levels are significantly higher in patients 
      with RFC1 disease compared to HCs and correlate with cerebellar involvement. 
      Longitudinal studies are warranted to assess its change over time.

AB  - An intronic bi-allelic pentanucleotide repeat expansion mutation, 
      (AAGGG)(400-2000), at AAAAG repeat locus in RFC1 gene, is known as underlying 
      genetic cause in cases with cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular 
      areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) and late-onset sporadic ataxia. Biallelic positive 
      cases carry a common recessive risk haplotype, "AAGA," spanning RFC1 gene. In 
      this study, our aim is to find prevalence of bi-allelic (AAGGG)(exp) in Indian 
      ataxia and other neurological disorders and investigate the complexity of RFC1 
      repeat locus and its potential association with neurodegenerative diseases in 
      Indian population-based cohorts. We carried out repeat number and repeat type 
      estimation using flanking PCR and repeat primed PCR (AAAAG/AAAGG/AAGGG) in four 
      Indian disease cohorts and healthy controls. Haplotype assessment of suspected 
      cases was done by genotyping and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Blood samples 
      and consent of all the cases and detailed clinical details of positive cases were 
      collected in collaboration with A.I.I.M.S. Furthermore, comprehension of RFC1 
      repeat locus and risk haplotype analysis in Indian background was performed on 
      the NGS data of Indian healthy controls by ExpansionHunter, ExpansionHunter 
      Denovo, and PHASE analysis, respectively. Genetic screening of RFC1-TNR locus in 
      1998 uncharacterized cases (SCA12: 87; uncharacterized ataxia: 1818, CMT: 93) and 
      564 heterogenous controls showed that the frequency of subjects with bi-allelic 
      (AAGGG)(exp) are 1.15%, < 0.05%, 2.15%, and 0% respectively. Two RFC1 positive 
      sporadic late-onset ataxia cases, one bi-allelic (AAGGG)(exp) and another, 
      (AAAGG)(~700)/(AAGGG)(exp), had recessive risk haplotype and CANVAS symptoms. 
      Long normal alleles, 15-27, are significantly rare in ataxia cohort. In IndiGen 
      control population (IndiGen; N = 1029), long normal repeat range, 15-27, is 
      significantly associated with A(3)G(3) and some rare repeat motifs, AGAGG, AACGG, 
      AAGAG, and AAGGC. Risk-associated "AAGA" haplotype of the original pathogenic 
      expansion of A(2)G(3) was found associated with the A(3)G(3) representing alleles 
      in background population. Apart from bi-allelic (AAGGG)(exp), we report cases 
      with a new pathogenic expansion of (AAAGG)(exp)/(AAGGG)(exp) in RFC1 and 
      recessive risk haplotype. We found different repeat motifs at RFC1 TNR locus, 
      like AAAAG, AAAGG, AAAGGG, AAAAGG, AAGAG, AACGG, AAGGC, AGAGG, and AAGGG, in 
      Indian background population except ACAGG and (AAAGG)(n)/(AAGGG)(n). Our findings 
      will help in further understanding the role of long normal repeat size and 
      different repeat motifs, specifically AAAGG, AAAGGG, and other rare repeat 
      motifs, at the RFC1 locus.

TI  - Optical Genome Mapping Enables Detection and Accurate Sizing of RFC1 Repeat 
      Expansions.
LID - 10.3390/biom13101546 [doi]
LID - 1546
AB  - A recessive Short Tandem Repeat expansion in RFC1 has been found to be associated 
      with cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS), 
      and to be a frequent cause of late onset ataxia and sensory neuropathy. The usual 
      procedure for sizing these expansions is based on Southern Blotting (SB), a 
      time-consuming and a relatively imprecise technique. In this paper, we compare SB 
      with Optical Genome Mapping (OGM), a method for detecting Structural Variants 
      (SVs) based on the measurement of distances between fluorescently labelled 
      probes, for the diagnosis of RFC1 CANVAS and disease spectrum. The two methods 
      are applied to 17 CANVAS patients' blood samples and resulting sizes compared, 
      showing a good agreement. Further, long-read sequencing is used for two patients 
      to investigate the agreement of sizes with either SB or OGM. Our study concludes 
      that OGM represents a viable alternative to SB, allowing for a simpler technique, 
      a more precise sizing of the expansion and ability to expand analysis of SV in 
      the entire genome as opposed to SB which is a locus specific method.

AB  - Cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) has 
      recently been attributed to biallelic repeat expansions in RFC1. More recently, 
      the disease entity has expanded to atypical phenotypes, including chronic 
      neuropathy without cerebellar ataxia or vestibular areflexia. Very recently, RFC1 
      expansions were found in patients with Sjogren syndrome who had neuropathy that 
      did not respond to immunotherapy. In this study RFC1 was examined in 240 patients 
      with acute or chronic neuropathies, including 105 with Guillain-Barre syndrome or 
      Miller Fisher syndrome, 76 with chronic inflammatory demyelinating 
      polyneuropathy, and 59 with other types of chronic neuropathy. Biallelic RFC1 
      mutations were found in three patients with immune-mediated neuropathies, 
      including Guillain-Barre syndrome, idiopathic sensory ataxic neuropathy, or 
      anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) neuropathy, who responded to 
      immunotherapies. In addition, a patient with chronic sensory autonomic neuropathy 
      had biallelic mutations, and subclinical changes in Schwann cells on nerve 
      biopsy. In summary, we found CANVAS-related RFC1 mutations in patients with 
      treatable immune-mediated neuropathy or demyelinating neuropathy.

AB  - The most important complication of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is 
      secondary amyloidosis. The aim of this study is to investigate the risk of 
      developing FMF-related amyloidosis with macrophage migration inhibitory factor 
      (MIF), interleukin 4 (IL-4), and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) variants. This 
      study included 62 FMF patients with amyloidosis, 110 FMF patients without 
      amyloidosis, and 120 controls. The clinical information of the patient groups was 
      compared. MIF-173G/C, IL-4 variant number tandem repeat (VNTR), and IL-1RA VNTR 
      variants were analyzed for all participants. The use of colchicine, pleurisy, and 
      appendectomy was more common in FMF patients with amyloidosis than in FMF 
      patients without amyloidosis. MIF-173G/C C/C genotype and C allele were higher in 
      both patient groups compared to controls. IL-1RA VNTR A1/A2 and A1/A4 genotypes 
      and A1-A4 alleles were more common in both patient groups than controls. The IL-4 
      VNTR P1 allele was more common in FMF patients with amyloidosis compared to 
      controls. The MIF-173G/C allele and the IL-1RA VNTR A1-A4 allele are associated 
      with FMF in the Turkish population but not with amyloidosis risk in FMF patients. 
      The IL-4 VNTR P1 allele is more common in FMF patients with amyloidosis than in 
      healthy individuals.

AB  - The well-known eye-of-the-tiger sign features bilateral and symmetrical changes 
      in the globus pallidus, with a central area of high signal and peripheral low 
      signal on T2-weighted MRI. Although formally considered pathognomonic of 
      pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN), there are other 
      neurodegenerative or genetic diseases showing similar findings. Cerebellar ataxia 
      with neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) is a late-onset 
      ataxia, that was recently associated with biallelic AAGGG repeat expansion in the 
      RFC1 gene. Although its predominant MRI finding is cerebellar atrophy, there may 
      be other less common associated findings. Our aim is to present two cases of 
      CANVAS with associated (pseudo-)eye-of-the-tiger sign, highlighting the 
      possibility of yet another differential diagnosis for this imaging sign.

AB  - Biallelic expansions of various tandem repeat sequence motifs are possible in 
      RFC1 (replication factor C subunit 1), encoding the DNA replication/repair 
      protein RFC1, yet only certain repeat motifs cause cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, 
      and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). CANVAS presents enigmatic puzzles: 
      The pathogenic path for CANVAS neither is known nor is it understood why some, 
      but not all expanded, motifs are pathogenic. The most common pathogenic repeat is 
      (AAGGG)n*(CCCTT)n, whereas (AAAAG)n*(CTTTT)n is the most common nonpathogenic 
      motif. While both intronic motifs can be expanded and transcribed, only r(AAGGG)n 
      is retained in the mutant RFC1 transcript. We show that only the pathogenic forms 
      unusual nucleic acid structures. Specifically, DNA and RNA of the pathogenic 
      d(AAGGG)4 and r(AAGGG)4 form G-quadruplexes in potassium solution. Nonpathogenic 
      repeats did not form G-quadruplexes. Triple-stranded structures are formed by the 
      pathogenic motifs but not by the nonpathogenic motifs. G- and C-richness of the 
      pathogenic strands favor formation of G*G*G*G-tetrads and protonated C+-G 
      Hoogsteen base pairings, involved in quadruplex and triplex structures, 
      respectively, stabilized by increased hydrogen bonds and pi-stacking interactions 
      relative to A-T Hoogsteen pairs that could form by the nonpathogenic motif. The 
      ligand, TMPyP4, binds the pathogenic quadruplexes. Formation of quadruplexes and 
      triplexes by pathogenic repeats supports toxic-DNA and toxic-RNA modes of 
      pathogenesis at the RFC1 gene and the RFC1 transcript. Our findings with short 
      repeats provide insights into the disease specificity of pathogenic repeat motif 
      sequences and reveal nucleic acid structural features that may be pathogenically 
      involved and targeted therapeutically.

TI  - Frequency and phenotypic spectrum of spinocerebellar ataxia 27B and other genetic 
      ataxias in a Spanish cohort of late-onset cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 3828-3833
LID - 10.1111/ene.16039 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dominantly inherited GAA repeat expansions in the 
      fibroblast growth factor 14 (FGF14) gene have recently been shown to cause 
      spinocerebellar ataxia 27B (SCA27B). We aimed to study the frequency and 
      phenotype of SCA27B in a cohort of patients with unsolved late-onset cerebellar 
      ataxia (LOCA). We also assessed the frequency of SCA27B relative to other 
      genetically defined LOCAs. METHODS: We recruited a consecutive series of 107 
      patients with LOCA, of whom 64 remained genetically undiagnosed. We screened 
      these 64 patients for the FGF14 GAA repeat expansion. We next analysed the 
      frequency of SCA27B relative to other genetically defined forms of LOCA in the 
      cohort of 107 patients. RESULTS: Eighteen of 64 patients (28%) carried an FGF14 
      (GAA)(>/=250) expansion. The median (range) age at onset was 62.5 (39-72) years. 
      The most common clinical features included gait ataxia (100%) and mild cerebellar 
      dysarthria (67%). In addition, episodic symptoms and downbeat nystagmus were 
      present in 39% (7/18) and 37% (6/16) of patients, respectively. SCA27B was the 
      most common cause of LOCA in our cohort (17%, 18/107). Among patients with 
      genetically defined LOCA, SCA27B was the main cause of pure ataxia, RFC1-related 
      disease of ataxia with neuropathy, and SPG7 of ataxia with spasticity. 
      CONCLUSION: We showed that SCA27B is the most common cause of LOCA in our cohort. 
      Our results support the use of FGF14 GAA repeat expansion screening as a 
      first-tier genetic test in patients with LOCA.

TI  - Frequency and Phenotype of RFC1 Repeat Expansions in Bilateral Vestibulopathy.
PG  - e1001-e1013

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Bilateral vestibulopathy (BVP) is a chronic 
      debilitating neurologic disorder with no monogenic cause established so far 
      despite familiar presentations. We hypothesized that replication factor complex 
      subunit 1 (RFC1) repeat expansions might present a recurrent monogenic cause of 
      BVP. METHODS: The study involved RFC1 screening and in-depth neurologic, 
      vestibulo-oculomotor, and disease evolution phenotyping of 168 consecutive 
      patients with idiopathic at least "probable BVP" from a tertiary referral center 
      for balance disorders, with127 of them meeting current diagnostic criteria of BVP 
      (Barany Society Classification). RESULTS: Biallelic AAGGG repeat expansions in 
      RFC1 were identified in 10/127 patients (8%) with BVP and 1/41 with probable BVP. 
      Heterozygous expansions in 10/127 patients were enriched compared with those in 
      reference populations. RFC1-related BVP manifested at a median age of 60 years 
      (range 34-72 years) and co-occurred predominantly with mild polyneuropathy 
      (10/11). Additional cerebellar involvement (7/11) was subtle and limited to 
      oculomotor signs in early stages, below recognition of classic cerebellar ataxia, 
      neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome. Clear dysarthria, appendicular 
      ataxia, or cerebellar atrophy developed 6-8 years after onset. Dysarthria, absent 
      patellar reflexes, and downbeat nystagmus best discriminated RFC1-positive BVP 
      from RFC1-negative BVP, but neither sensory symptoms nor fine motor problems. 
      Video head impulse gains of patients with RFC1-positive BVP were lower relative 
      to those of patients with RFC1-negative BVP and decreased until 10 years disease 
      duration, indicating a potential progression and outcome marker for RFC1-disease. 
      DISCUSSION: This study identifies RFC1 as the first-and frequent-monogenic cause 
      of BVP. It characterizes RFC1-related BVP as part of the multisystemic evolution 
      of RFC1 spectrum disease, with implications for designing natural history studies 
      and future treatment trials. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides 
      Class II evidence that RFC1 repeat expansions cause BVP.

LID - 10.1093/brain/awad240 [doi]
AB  - Cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) is an 
      autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease, usually caused by biallelic AAGGG 
      repeat expansions in RFC1. In this study, we leveraged whole genome sequencing 
      data from nearly 10 000 individuals recruited within the Genomics England 
      sequencing project to investigate the normal and pathogenic variation of the RFC1 
      repeat. We identified three novel repeat motifs, AGGGC (n = 6 from five 
      families), AAGGC (n = 2 from one family) and AGAGG (n = 1), associated with 
      CANVAS in the homozygous or compound heterozygous state with the common 
      pathogenic AAGGG expansion. While AAAAG, AAAGGG and AAGAG expansions appear to be 
      benign, we revealed a pathogenic role for large AAAGG repeat configuration 
      expansions (n = 5). Long-read sequencing was used to characterize the entire 
      repeat sequence, and six patients exhibited a pure AGGGC expansion, while the 
      other patients presented complex motifs with AAGGG or AAAGG interruptions. All 
      pathogenic motifs appeared to have arisen from a common haplotype and were 
      predicted to form highly stable G quadruplexes, which have previously been 
      demonstrated to affect gene transcription in other conditions. The assessment of 
      these novel configurations is warranted in CANVAS patients with negative or 
      inconclusive genetic testing. Particular attention should be paid to carriers of 
      compound AAGGG/AAAGG expansions when the AAAGG motif is very large (>500 repeats) 
      or the AAGGG motif is interrupted. Accurate sizing and full sequencing of the 
      satellite repeat with long-read sequencing is recommended in clinically selected 
      cases to enable accurate molecular diagnosis and counsel patients and their 
      families.

TI  - Can CANVAS due to RFC1 biallelic expansions present with pure ataxia?
PG  - 171-174
LID - 10.1136/jnnp-2023-331381 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biallelic expansion of AAGGG in the replication factor complex 
      subunit 1 (RFC1) was identified as a major cause of cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy 
      (sensory ganglionopathy, or SG) and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). We 
      wanted to clarify if RFC1 expansions can present with pure ataxia and if such 
      expansions could be responsible for some cases where an alternative diagnosis had 
      been made. METHODS: We identified patients with a combination of ataxia and SG 
      and no other cause found, patients where an alternative diagnosis had been made, 
      and patients with pure ataxia. Testing for RFC1 expansions was done using 
      established methodology. RESULTS: Among 54 patients with otherwise idiopathic 
      sporadic ataxia without SG, none was found to have RFC1 expansions. Among 38 
      patients with cerebellar ataxia and SG in which all other causes were excluded, 
      71% had RFC1 expansions. Among 27 patients with cerebellar ataxia and SG 
      diagnosed with coeliac disease or gluten sensitivity, 15% had RFC1 expansions. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Isolated cerebellar ataxia without SG makes the diagnosis of CANVAS 
      due to RFC1 expansions highly improbable, but CANVAS is frequently the cause of 
      the combination of idiopathic cerebellar ataxia with SG. It is important to 
      screen patients diagnosed with other causes of acquired ataxia and SG as a small 
      percentage were found to have RFC1 expansions.

TI  - Intronic FGF14 GAA repeat expansions are a common cause of ataxia syndromes with 
      neuropathy and bilateral vestibulopathy.
PG  - 175-179
LID - 10.1136/jnnp-2023-331490 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intronic GAA repeat expansions in the fibroblast growth factor 14 
      gene (FGF14) have recently been identified as a common cause of ataxia with 
      potential phenotypic overlap with RFC1-related cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy and 
      vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). Our objective was to report on the 
      frequency of intronic FGF14 GAA repeat expansions in patients with an unexplained 
      CANVAS-like phenotype. METHODS: We recruited 45 patients negative for biallelic 
      RFC1 repeat expansions with a combination of cerebellar ataxia plus peripheral 
      neuropathy and/or bilateral vestibulopathy (BVP), and genotyped the FGF14 repeat 
      locus. Phenotypic features of GAA-FGF14-positive versus GAA-FGF14-negative 
      patients were compared. RESULTS: Frequency of FGF14 GAA repeat expansions was 38% 
      (17/45) in the entire cohort, 38% (5/13) in the subgroup with cerebellar ataxia 
      plus polyneuropathy, 43% (9/21) in the subgroup with cerebellar ataxia plus BVP 
      and 27% (3/11) in patients with all three features. BVP was observed in 75% 
      (12/16) of GAA-FGF14-positive patients. Polyneuropathy was at most mild and of 
      mixed sensorimotor type in six of eight GAA-FGF14-positive patients. Family 
      history of ataxia (59% vs 15%; p=0.007) was significantly more frequent and 
      permanent cerebellar dysarthria (12% vs 54%; p=0.009) significantly less frequent 
      in GAA-FGF14-positive than in GAA-FGF14-negative patients. Age at onset was 
      inversely correlated to the size of the repeat expansion (Pearson's r, -0.67; 
      R(2)=0.45; p=0.0031). CONCLUSIONS: GAA-FGF14-related disease is a common cause of 
      cerebellar ataxia with polyneuropathy and/or BVP, and should be included in the 
      differential diagnosis of RFC1 CANVAS and disease spectrum.

AB  - Cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) is a 
      progressive neurodegenerative disorder predominantly caused by biallelic AAGGG 
      expansions in the second intron of the RFC1 gene. Here, we used a simultaneous 
      reprogramming and CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing approach to generate three patient 
      iPSC lines with homozygous AAGGG expansions along with three heterozygous gene 
      corrected iPSC lines. The iPSC lines expressed pluripotency markers, had a normal 
      karyotype, and were able to differentiate into all three embryonic germ layers. 
      These mutant and corrected iPSC lines will be a valuable tool for studying the 
      molecular mechanisms underlying CANVAS.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pathogenic expansions in RFC1 have been described as a cause of a 
      spectrum of disorders including late-onset ataxia, chronic cough, and cerebellar 
      ataxia, neuropathy, vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). Sensory 
      neuronopathy/neuropathy appears to be a major symptom of RFC1-disorder, and RFC1 
      expansions are common in patients with sensory chronic idiopathic axonal 
      neuropathy or sensory ganglionopathy. We aimed to investigate RFC1 expansions in 
      patients with suspected RFC1-related disease followed-up in a Neuromuscular 
      Diseases Unit, with a particular interest in the involvement of the peripheral 
      nervous system. METHODS: We recruited twenty consecutive patients based on the 
      presence of at least two of the following features: progressive ataxia, sensory 
      neuropathy/neuronopathy, vestibulopathy and chronic cough. Medical records were 
      retrospectively reviewed for a detailed clinical description. More extensive 
      phenotyping of the RFC1-positive patients and clinical comparison between RFC1 
      positive and negative patients were performed. RESULTS: Biallelic AAGGG repeat 
      expansions were identified in 13 patients (65%). The most frequent symptoms were 
      chronic cough and sensory disturbances in the lower extremities (12/13). Only 4 
      patients (31%) had complete CANVAS. The phenotypes were sensory ataxia and 
      sensory symptoms in extremities in 4/13; sensory ataxia, sensory symptoms, and 
      vestibulopathy in 3/13; sensory symptoms plus chronic cough in 2/13. Chronic 
      cough and isolated sensory neuronopathy were significantly more prevalent in 
      RFC1-positive patients. CONCLUSION: Pathogenic RFC1 expansions are a common cause 
      of sensory neuropathy/neuronopathy and should be considered in the approach to 
      these patients. Identification of key symptoms or detailed interpretation of 
      nerve conduction studies may improve patient selection for genetic testing.

TI  - Association of biallelic RFC1 expansion with early-onset Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 1256-1261
LID - 10.1111/ene.15717 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The biallelic repeat expansion (AAGGG)(exp) in the 
      replication factor C subunit 1 gene (RFC1) is a frequent cause of cerebellar 
      ataxia, neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) as well as 
      late-onset ataxia. The clinical spectrum of RFC1 disease has expanded since the 
      first identification of biallelic (AAGGG)(exp) and includes now various 
      nonclassical phenotypes. Biallelic (AAGGG)(exp) in RFC1 in patients with 
      clinically confirmed Parkinson's disease (PD) has recently been found. METHODS: A 
      nationwide cohort of 273 Finnish patients with early-onset PD was examined for 
      the biallelic intronic expansion in RFC1. The expansion (AAGGG)(exp) was first 
      screened using extra long polymerase chain reactions (Extra Large-PCRs) and 
      flanking multiplex PCR. The presence of biallelic (AAGGG)(exp) was then confirmed 
      by repeat-primed PCR and, finally, the repeat length was determined by long-read 
      sequencing. RESULTS: Three patients were found with the biallelic (AAGGG)(exp) in 
      RFC1 giving a frequency of 1.10% (0.23%-3.18%; 95% confidence interval). The 
      three patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of PD, none of them had ataxia 
      or neuropathy, and only one patient had a mild vestibular dysfunction. The age at 
      onset of PD symptoms was 40-48 years and their disease course had been 
      unremarkable apart from the early onset. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that 
      (AAGGG)(exp) in RFC1 is a rare cause of early-onset PD. Other populations should 
      be examined in order to determine whether our findings are specific to the 
      Finnish population.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: We investigated the genetic basis and brain metabolism 
      and blood flow of a Japanese family with spinocerebellar degeneration (SCD), with 
      multiple affected members for 3 generations. METHODS: After excluding DNA repeat 
      expansion (RE) of common SCD genes by fragment analysis, we performed whole-exome 
      sequencing (WES) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Homozygosity mapping was 
      performed using these data. REs were investigated with WGS data using 
      ExpansionHunter Denovo and Expansion Hunter. RESULTS: WES and WGS were unable to 
      identify likely pathogenic variants, and homozygosity mapping failed to narrow 
      down the locus. However, ExpansionHunter Denovo detected REs in intron 2 of the 
      RFC1 gene and led us to the diagnosis of RFC1-related disorders. Subsequent 
      repeat-primed PCR and Southern blot hybridization analyses revealed that 3 of 6 
      patients and 1 suspected individual had expansions of AAGGG ((AAGGG)(exp)) and 
      (ACAGG)(exp) repeats in a compound heterozygous state and 3 had a homozygous 
      (ACAGG)(exp). The patients showed a variety of clinical features, including 
      adult-onset ataxia, sensorimotor neuropathy, head tremor, parkinsonism, dystonia, 
      and cognitive impairment. A comparison of previous reports with those of the 
      family in study suggested that motor neuropathy could be a feature of compound 
      heterozygous patients and biallelic (ACAGG)(exp) patients. Cognitive function 
      tests showed cognitive impairment with a predominance of frontal lobe 
      dysfunction. Examination of MRI, SPECT, and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET showed 
      clear cortical damage with frontal lobe predominance in 1 case, but no cerebral 
      damage was evident in the other 2 cases. DISCUSSION: Our report shows the 
      usefulness of WGS and RE detection tools for SCD of unknown cause. The studied 
      family with RFC1-related disorders included patients with (ACAGG)(exp) and 
      (AAGGG)(exp) in a compound heterozygous state and was characterized by motor 
      neuropathy. Based on the results of cognitive function tests and imaging studies, 
      1 patient presented with cognitive impairment due to frontal lobe metabolic 
      changes, but there were also patients who presented with cognitive impairment 
      without apparent cerebral metabolic or blood flow, suggesting that other factors 
      are also associated with cognitive impairment.

TI  - Truncating Variants in RFC1 in Cerebellar Ataxia, Neuropathy, and Vestibular 
      Areflexia Syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia 
      syndrome (CANVAS) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease 
      characterized by adult-onset and slowly progressive sensory neuropathy, 
      cerebellar dysfunction, and vestibular impairment. In most cases, the disease is 
      caused by biallelic (AAGGG)(n) repeat expansions in the second intron of the 
      replication factor complex subunit 1 (RFC1). However, a small number of cases 
      with typical CANVAS do not carry the common biallelic repeat expansion. The 
      objective of this study was to expand the genotypic spectrum of CANVAS by 
      identifying sequence variants in RFC1-coding region associated with this 
      condition. METHODS: Fifteen individuals diagnosed with CANVAS and carrying only 1 
      heterozygous (AAGGG)(n) expansion in RFC1 underwent whole-genome sequencing or 
      whole-exome sequencing to test for the presence of a second variant in RFC1 or 
      other unrelated gene. To assess the effect of truncating variants on RFC1 
      expression, we tested the level of RFC1 transcript and protein on patients' 
      derived cell lines. RESULTS: We identified 7 patients from 5 unrelated families 
      with clinically defined CANVAS carrying a heterozygous (AAGGG)(n) expansion 
      together with a second truncating variant in trans in RFC1, which included the 
      following: c.1267C>T (p.Arg423Ter), c.1739_1740del (p.Lys580SerfsTer9), c.2191del 
      (p.Gly731GlufsTer6), and c.2876del (p.Pro959GlnfsTer24). Patient fibroblasts 
      containing the c.1267C>T (p.Arg423Ter) or c.2876del (p.Pro959GlnfsTer24) variants 
      demonstrated nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and reduced RFC1 transcript and 
      protein. DISCUSSION: Our report expands the genotype spectrum of RFC1 disease. 
      Full RFC1 sequencing is recommended in cases affected by typical CANVAS and 
      carrying monoallelic (AAGGG)(n) expansions. In addition, it sheds further light 
      on the pathogenesis of RFC1 CANVAS because it supports the existence of a 
      loss-of-function mechanism underlying this complex neurodegenerative condition.

TI  - New Cerebellar Ataxia, Neuropathy, Vestibular Areflexia Syndrome cases are caused 
      by the presence of a nonsense variant in compound heterozygosity with the 
      pathogenic repeat expansion in the RFC1 gene.
PG  - 236-241
LID - 10.1111/cge.14249 [doi]
AB  - The biallelic pathogenic repeat (AAGGG)(400-2000) intronic expansion in the RFC1 
      gene has been recently described as the cause of cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, 
      vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) and as a major cause of late-onset ataxia. 
      Since then, many heterozygous carriers have been identified, with an estimated 
      allele frequency of 0.7% to 4% in the healthy population. Here, we describe in 
      two affected CANVAS sisters the presence of the nonsense c.724C > T p.(Arg242*) 
      variant in compound heterozygosity with the pathogenic repeat expansion in the 
      RFC1 gene. Further RNA analysis demonstrated a reduced expression of the 
      p.Arg242* allele in patients confirming an efficient nonsense-mediated mRNA 
      decay. We also highlight the importance of considering the sequencing of the RFC1 
      gene for the diagnosis, especially in patients with CANVAS diagnosis carriers of 
      the AAGGG repeat expansion.

AB  - Instability of simple DNA repeats has been known as a common cause of hereditary 
      ataxias for over 20 years. Routine genetic diagnostics of these phenotypically 
      similar diseases still rely on an iterative workflow for quantification of repeat 
      units by PCR-based methods of limited precision. We established and validated 
      clinical nanopore Cas9-targeted sequencing, an amplification-free method for 
      simultaneous analysis of 10 repeat loci associated with clinically overlapping 
      hereditary ataxias. The method combines target enrichment by CRISPR-Cas9, Oxford 
      Nanopore long-read sequencing and a bioinformatics pipeline using the tools 
      STRique and Megalodon for parallel detection of length, sequence, methylation and 
      composition of the repeat loci. Clinical nanopore Cas9-targeted sequencing 
      allowed for the precise and parallel analysis of 10 repeat loci associated with 
      adult-onset ataxia and revealed additional parameter such as FMR1 promotor 
      methylation and repeat sequence required for diagnosis at the same time. Using 
      clinical nanopore Cas9-targeted sequencing we analysed 100 clinical samples of 
      undiagnosed ataxia patients and identified causative repeat expansions in 28 
      patients. Parallel repeat analysis enabled a molecular diagnosis of ataxias 
      independent of preconceptions on the basis of clinical presentation. Biallelic 
      expansions within RFC1 were identified as the most frequent cause of ataxia. We 
      characterized the RFC1 repeat composition of all patients and identified a novel 
      repeat motif, AGGGG. Our results highlight the power of clinical nanopore 
      Cas9-targeted sequencing as a readily expandable workflow for the in-depth 
      analysis and diagnosis of phenotypically overlapping repeat expansion disorders.

TI  - Complete Mitochondrial Genome Sequences of Korean Phytophthora infestans Isolates 
      and Comparative Analysis of Mitochondrial Haplotypes.

AB  - Potato late blight caused by Phytophthora infestans is a destructive disease in 
      Korea. To elucidate the genomic variation of the mitochondrial (mt) genome, we 
      assembled its complete mt genome and compared its sequence among different 
      haplotypes. The mt genome sequences of four Korean P. infestans isolates were 
      revealed by Illumina HiSeq. The size of the circular mt genome of the four major 
      genotypes, KR_1_A1, KR_2_A2, SIB-1, and US-11, was 39,872, 39,836, 39,872, and 
      39,840 bp, respectively. All genotypes contained the same 61 genes in the same 
      order, comprising two RNA-encoding genes, 16 ribosomal genes, 25 transfer RNA, 17 
      genes encoding electron transport and ATP synthesis, 11 open reading frames of 
      unknown function, and one protein import-related gene, tatC. The coding region 
      comprised 91% of the genome, and GC content was 22.3%. The haplotypes were 
      further analyzed based on sequence polymorphism at two hypervariable regions 
      (HVRi), carrying a 2 kb insertion/deletion sequence, and HVRii, carrying 36 bp 
      variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs). All four genotypes carried the 2 kb 
      insertion/deletion sequence in HVRi, whereas HVRii had two VNTRs in KR_1_A1 and 
      SIB-1 but three VNTRs in US-11 and KR_2_A2. Minimal spanning network and 
      phylogenetic analysis based on 5,814 bp of mtDNA sequences from five loci, 
      KR_1_A1 and SIB-1 were classified as IIa-6 haplotype, and isolates KR_1_A2 and 
      US-11 as haplotypes IIa-5 and IIb-2, respectively. mtDNA sequences of KR_1_A1 and 
      SIB-1 shared 100% sequence identity, and both were 99.9% similar to those of 
      KR_2_A2 and US-11.

PG  - 311-315
LID - 10.1111/jns.12515 [doi]
AB  - Biallelic repeat expansions in replication factor C subunit 1 (RFC1) have 
      recently been found to cause cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy and vestibular 
      areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). Additional features that have been described include 
      Parkinsonism and a multiple system atrophy (MSA)-like syndrome. CANVAS can 
      include features of dysautonomia, but they are much milder than typically seen in 
      MSA. We report a detailed autonomic phenotype of multisystem RFC1-related disease 
      presenting initially as CANVAS. Our patient presented aged 61 with a sensory 
      ataxic neuropathy who rapidly developed widespread autonomic failure and 
      Parkinsonism. The autonomic profile was of a mixed pre- and post-ganglionic 
      syndrome with progressive involvement of sympathetic and parasympathetic 
      cardiovascular and sudomotor function. The Parkinsonism did not respond to 
      levodopa. We present a patient with CANVAS and biallelic RFC1 expansions who 
      developed Parkinsonism with severe autonomic involvement similar to that seen in 
      classical MSA. The link between MSA and CANVAS remains uncertain.

TI  - Spanish HTT gene study reveals haplotype and allelic diversity with possible 
      implications for germline expansion dynamics in Huntington disease.
PG  - 897-906

AB  - We aimed to determine the genetic diversity and molecular characteristics of the 
      Huntington disease (HD) gene (HTT) in Spain. We performed an extended haplotype 
      and exon one deep sequencing analysis of the HTT gene in a nationwide cohort of 
      population-based controls (n = 520) and families with symptomatic individuals 
      referred for HD genetic testing. This group included 331 HD cases and 140 
      carriers of intermediate alleles. Clinical and family history data were obtained 
      when available. Spanish normal alleles are enriched in C haplotypes (40.1%), 
      whereas A1 (39.8%) and A2 (31.6%) prevail among intermediate and expanded 
      alleles, respectively. Alleles >/= 50 CAG repeats are primarily associated with 
      haplotypes A2 (38.9%) and C (32%), which are also present in 50% and 21.4%, 
      respectively, of HD families with large intergenerational expansions. 
      Non-canonical variants of exon one sequence are less frequent, but much more 
      diverse, in alleles of >/=27 CAG repeats. The deletion of CAACAG, one of the six 
      rare variants not observed among smaller normal alleles, is associated with 
      haplotype C and appears to correlate with larger intergenerational expansions and 
      early onset of symptoms. Spanish HD haplotypes are characterized by a high 
      genetic diversity, potentially admixed with other non-Caucasian populations, with 
      a higher representation of A2 and C haplotypes than most European populations. 
      Differences in haplotype distributions across the CAG length range support 
      differential germline expansion dynamics, with A2 and C showing the largest 
      intergenerational expansions. This haplotype-dependent germline instability may 
      be driven by specific cis-elements, such as the CAACAG deletion.

TI  - Cognitive impairment is not uncommon in patients with biallelic RFC1 AAGGG repeat 
      expansion, but the expansion is rare in patients with cognitive disease.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The biallelic repeat expansion (AAGGG)(exp) in RFC1 causes 
      cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). 
      Recently, cognitive impairment has been reported in patients with CANVAS and a 
      broader neurodegenerative process associated with RFC1 has been suggested. 
      Furthermore, rare cases of multiple system atrophy, Parkinson's disease, 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or CANVAS with features of dementia with Lewy 
      bodies have been found. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that the biallelic 
      (AAGGG)(exp) is associated with neurodegeneration manifested as cognitive 
      symptoms and that atypical RFC1 disease may be found among patients with 
      cognitive disorder. METHODS: Clinical data on nine patients with biallelic 
      (AAGGG)(exp) were reviewed and 564 patients with Alzheimer's disease or 
      frontotemporal dementia (FTD) were investigated for biallelic RFC1 (AAGGG)(exp). 
      RESULTS: Five patients with biallelic (AAGGG)(exp) were found with a cognitive 
      impairment and in four of them the phenotype resembled FTD. However, biallelic 
      (AAGGG)(exp) was not detected among patients with Alzheimer's disease or FTD. 
      CONCLUSION: Cognitive impairment is a feature in patients with the biallelic 
      (AAGGG)(exp), but the pathogenic expansion seems to be rare in patients with 
      dementia. Studies on patients with diverse phenotypes would be useful to further 
      explore the involvement of RFC1 in neuronal degeneration and to identify atypical 
      phenotypes, which should be taken into account in clinical practice.

AB  - Non-coding repeat expansions within RFC1 and NOTCH2NLC genes have lately been 
      linked to multisystem neurodegenerative diseases, which also shed light on yet 
      undiagnosed patients with inherited peripheral neuropathies. The aim of this 
      study was to identify the genetic basis of patients with hereditary sensory and 
      autonomic neuropathy (HSAN). We collected 79 unrelated DNA samples clinically 
      suspected with HSAN from multiple regions of Japan. Mutation screening was first 
      performed using gene panel sequencing and whole-exome sequencing. 
      Pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were identified from genes of WNK1/HSN2 (6 
      cases), SCN9A (3 cases), NTRK1 (3 cases), and DNMT1 (2 cases). Subsequently, 
      long-range flanking PCR and repeat-primed PCR were applied to analyze repeat 
      expansions in RFC1 and NOTCH2NLC. Bi-allelic RFC1 repeat expansions were detected 
      from 20 adult-onset HSAN patients, consisting of [(AAGGG)exp/(AAGGG)exp] (8 
      cases), [(ACAGG)exp/(ACAGG)exp] (8 cases), and [(AAGGG)exp/(ACAGG)exp] (4 cases). 
      GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC was found in 1 case. Single-nucleotide 
      variant-based haplotype analysis of patients harboring disease-associated repeat 
      expansions in RFC1 revealed distinguishable haplotypes among subgroups with 
      different repeat genotypes. These findings substantially redefine the genetic 
      spectrum of HSAN, where multi-type RFC1 repeat expansions account for 25.3% of 
      all patients, highlighting the necessity of genetic screening, particularly for 
      adult-onset patients.

AB  - In 2019, a biallelic pentanucleotide repeat expansion in the gene encoding 
      replication factor C subunit 1 (RFC1) was reported as a cause of cerebellar 
      ataxia with neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). In addition, 
      biallelic expansions were shown to account for up to 22% of cases with late-onset 
      ataxia. Since this discovery, the phenotypic spectrum reported to be associated 
      with RFC1 expansions has extended beyond the initial conditions to include pure 
      cerebellar ataxia, isolated somatosensory impairment, combinations of the 2, and 
      parkinsonism, leading to a potentially broad differential diagnosis. Genetic 
      studies suggest RFC1 expansions may be the most common genetic cause of ataxia 
      and are likely underdiagnosed. This review summarizes the current molecular and 
      clinical knowledge of RFC1-related disease, with a focus on the evaluation of 
      recent phenotype associations and highlighting the current challenges in clinical 
      pathways to diagnosis and molecular testing.

AB  - The recessive intronic pentanucleotide repeat AAGGG expansion of replication 
      factor complex subunit 1 (RFC1) is associated with cerebellar ataxia, sensory 
      neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome. And the clinical spectrum has been 
      continuously expanding. We conducted this study to demonstrate the clinical and 
      genetic features of a large-scale case series of Japanese patients with 
      cerebellar ataxia with RFC1 repeat expansions. We examined 1,289 Japanese 
      patients with cerebellar ataxia and analyzed RFC1 repeat expansions in 840 
      patients, excluding those with genetic diagnoses or an autosomal dominant 
      inheritance pattern. For individuals where no product was obtained by flanking 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR), repeat-primed PCR was performed using primers 
      specific for the following four repeat motifs: AAAAG, AAAGG, AAGGG, and ACAGG. 
      RFC1 analysis revealed multitype biallelic pathogenic repeat expansions in 15 
      patients, including (AAGGG)exp/(AAGGG)exp in seven patients, 
      (ACAGG)exp/(ACAGG)exp in three patients, (AAGGG)exp/(ACAGG)exp in four patients, 
      and (AAGGG)exp/(AAAGG)(15)(AAGGG)exp in one patient. Clinical analysis showed 
      various combinations of cerebellar ataxia, vestibular dysfunction, neuropathy, 
      cognitive decline, autonomic dysfunction, chronic cough, pyramidal tract 
      disorder, parkinsonism, involuntary movement, and muscle fasciculation. 
      Pathological RFC1 repeat expansions account for 1.8% (15/840) of undiagnosed 
      patients with cerebellar ataxia and sporadic/recessive/unclassified inheritance. 
      Screening of RFC1 repeat expansions should be considered in patients with 
      cerebellar ataxia, irrespective of their subtype and onset age.

TI  - Comprehensive Genetic Analyses of Inherited Peripheral Neuropathies in Japan: 
      Making Early Diagnosis Possible.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines10071546 [doi]
LID - 1546
AB  - Various genomic variants were linked to inherited peripheral neuropathies (IPNs), 
      including large duplication/deletion and repeat expansion, making genetic 
      diagnosis challenging. This large case series aimed to identify the genetic 
      characteristics of Japanese patients with IPNs. We collected data on 2695 IPN 
      cases throughout Japan, in which PMP22 copy number variation (CNV) was 
      pre-excluded. Genetic analyses were performed using DNA microarrays, 
      next-generation sequencing-based gene panel sequencing, whole-exome sequencing, 
      CNV analysis, and RFC1 repeat expansion analysis. The overall diagnostic rate and 
      the genetic spectrum of patients were summarized. We identified 909 cases with 
      suspected IPNs, pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. The most common 
      causative genes were MFN2, GJB1, MPZ, and MME. MFN2 was the most common cause for 
      early-onset patients, whereas GJB1 and MPZ were the leading causes of 
      middle-onset and late-onset patients, respectively. Meanwhile, GJB1 and MFN2 were 
      leading causes for demyelinating and axonal subtypes, respectively. Additionally, 
      we identified CNVs in MPZ and GJB1 genes and RFC1 repeat expansions. 
      Comprehensive genetic analyses explicitly demonstrated the genetic basis of our 
      IPN case series. A further understanding of the clinical characteristics of IPN 
      and genetic spectrum would assist in developing efficient genetic testing 
      strategies and facilitate early diagnosis.

AB  - Cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) is an 
      inherited late-onset neurological disease caused by bi-allelic AAGGG 
      pentanucleotide expansions within intron 2 of RFC1. Despite extensive studies, 
      the pathophysiological mechanism of these intronic expansions remains elusive. We 
      screened by clinical exome sequencing two unrelated patients presenting with 
      late-onset ataxia. A repeat-primer polymerase chain reaction was used for RFC1 
      AAGGG intronic expansion identification. RFC1 mRNA expression was assessed by 
      quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We identified the 
      first two CANVAS affected patients who are compound heterozygous for RFC1 
      truncating variants (p.Arg388* and c.575delA, respectively) and a pathological 
      AAGGG expansion. RFC1 expression studies in whole blood showed a significant 
      reduction of RFC1 mRNA for both patients compared to three patients with 
      bi-allelic RFC1 expansions. In conclusion, this observation provides clues that 
      suggest bi-allelic RFC1 conditional loss-of-function as the cause of the disease.

TI  - Prevalence of intronic repeat expansions in RFC1 in Dutch patients with CANVAS 
      and adult-onset ataxia.
PG  - 6086-6093
LID - 10.1007/s00415-022-11275-9 [doi]
AB  - Recently, an intronic biallelic (AAGGG)(n) repeat expansion in RFC1 was shown to 
      be a cause of CANVAS and adult-onset ataxia in multiple populations. As the 
      prevalence of the RFC1 repeat expansion in Dutch cases was unknown, we 
      retrospectively tested 9 putative CANVAS cases and two independent cohorts (A and 
      B) of 395 and 222 adult-onset ataxia cases, respectively, using the previously 
      published protocol and, for the first time optical genome mapping to determine 
      the size of the expanded RFC1 repeat. We identified the biallelic (AAGGG)(n) 
      repeat expansion in 5/9 (55%) putative CANVAS patients and in 10/617 (1.6%; 
      cohorts A + B) adult-onset ataxia patients. In addition to the AAGGG repeat 
      motif, we observed a putative GAAGG repeat motif in the repeat expansion with 
      unknown significance in two adult-onset ataxia patients. All the expanded 
      (AAGGG)(n) repeats identified were in the range of 800-1299 repeat units. The 
      intronic biallelic RFC1 repeat expansion thus explains a number of the Dutch 
      adult-onset ataxia cases that display the main clinical features of CANVAS, and 
      particularly when ataxia is combined with neuropathy. The yield of screening for 
      RFC1 expansions in unselected cohorts is relatively low. To increase the current 
      diagnostic yield in ataxia patients, we suggest adding RFC1 screening to the 
      genetic diagnostic workflow by using advanced techniques that attain long 
      fragments.

AB  - We screened 62 late-onset ataxia patients for the AAGGG pathological expansion in 
      the RFC-1 gene that, when biallelic, causes Cerebellar Ataxia, Neuropathy, 
      Vestibular Areflexia Syndrome (CANVAS). Nine patients tested positive. Six had a 
      previous diagnosis of sporadic adult-onset ataxia (SAOA) and three of multisystem 
      atrophy type C (MSA-C). Further six patients were heterozygous for the 
      pathological RFC-1 expansion, four with an initial diagnosis of MSA-C and two of 
      SAOA. In comparison with CANVAS, MSA-C patients had faster progression and 
      shorter disease duration to walking with aids. An abnormal DaTscan does not seem 
      to contribute to differential diagnosis between CANVAS and MSA-C.

PG  - 5095-5098
LID - 10.1007/s10072-022-06137-1 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Biallelic intronic AAGGG repeat expansion in the replication factor 
      C subunit 1 (RFC1) gene was recently identified in two/third of patients with 
      cerebellar ataxia, sensory neuropathy, and bilateral vestibular areflexia 
      syndrome (CANVAS). The phenotypic spectrum has expanded since (i.e., 
      parkinsonism, motor neuron involvement, cognitive decline); no behavioral 
      symptoms have been reported yet. CASE REPORT: We report an Italian family that 
      met the diagnostic criteria for CANVAS, and RFC1-expansion was detected in five 
      of seven. All the affected members presented behavioral-psychiatric symptoms 
      (anxiety, panic attacks, alcohol abuse) before the multisystemic RFC1-expansion 
      manifestation. The disease course was progressive, with ataxia and 
      behavioral-cognitive aspects as the most disabling symptoms. CONCLUSION: These 
      behavioral-cognitive observations may broaden the RFC1-expansion phenotypic 
      spectrum and highlight the importance of investigating the whole non-motor 
      symptoms in ataxic patients.

TI  - Head impulse testing in bilateral vestibulopathy in patients with genetically 
      defined CANVAS.
PG  - e32546
LID - 10.1002/brb3.2546 [doi]
LID - e32546
AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the association between disease duration and the 
      severity of bilateral vestibulopathy in individuals with complete or incomplete 
      CANVAS (Cerebellar Ataxia with Neuropathy and Vestibular Areflexia Syndrome) and 
      biallelic RFC1 repeat expansions. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of clinical 
      data and the vestibulo-ocular reflex quantified by the video head impulse test in 
      20 patients with confirmed biallelic RFC1 repeat expansions. RESULTS: 
      Vestibulo-ocular reflex gain at first admittance 6.9 +/- 5.0 years after disease 
      onset was 0.16 [0.15-0.31] (median [interquartile range]). Cross-sectional 
      analysis revealed that gain reduction was associated with disease duration. 
      Follow-up measurements were available for ten individuals: eight of them 
      exhibited a progressive decrease of the vestibulo-ocular reflex gain over time. 
      At the first visit, six of all patients (30%) did not show clinical signs of 
      cerebellar ataxia. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest a pathological horizontal head 
      impulse test, which can easily be obtained in many outpatient clinics, as a sign 
      of bilateral vestibulopathy in genetically confirmed CANVAS that can precede 
      clinically accessible cerebellar ataxia at least in a subset of patients. The 
      presumably continuous decline over time possibly reflects the neurodegenerative 
      character of the disease. Thus, genetic testing for RFC1 mutations in (isolated) 
      bilateral vestibulopathy might allow disease detection before the onset of 
      cerebellar signs. Further studies including a wider spectrum of vestibular 
      function tests are warranted in a prospective design.

AB  - Cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) is a 
      late-onset, slow-progressing multisystem neurodegenerative disorder. Biallelic 
      AAGGG repeat expansion in RFC1 has been identified as causative of this disease, 
      and repeat conformation heterogeneity (ACAGG repeat) was also recently implied. 
      To molecularly characterize this disease in Japanese patients with adult-onset 
      ataxia, we accumulated and screened 212 candidate families by an integrated 
      approach consisting of flanking PCR, repeat-primed PCR, Southern blotting and 
      long-read sequencing using Sequel II, GridION or PromethION. We identified 16 
      patients from 11 families, of whom seven had ACAGG expansions 
      [(ACAGG)exp/(ACAGG)exp] (ACAGG homozygotes), two had ACAGG and AAGGG expansions 
      [(ACAGG)exp/(AAGGG)exp] (ACAGG/AAGGG compound heterozygotes) and seven had AAGGG 
      expansions [(AAGGG)exp/(AAGGG)exp] (AAGGG homozygotes). The overall detection 
      rate was 5.2% (11/212 families including one family having two expansion 
      genotypes). Long-read sequencers revealed the entire sequence of both AAGGG and 
      ACAGG repeat expansions at the nucleotide level of resolution. Clinical 
      assessment and neuropathology results suggested that patients with ACAGG 
      expansions have similar clinical features to previously reported patients with 
      homozygous AAGGG expansions, although motor neuron involvement was more notable 
      in patients with ACAGG expansions (even if one allele was involved). Furthermore, 
      a later age of onset and slower clinical progression were implied in patients 
      with ACAGG/AAGGG compound heterozygous expansions compared with either ACAGG or 
      AAGGG homozygotes in our very limited cohort. Our study clearly shows the 
      occurrence of repeat conformation heterogeneity, with possible different impacts 
      on the affected nervous systems. The difference in disease onset and progression 
      between compound heterozygotes and homozygotes might also be suspected but with 
      very limited certainty due to the small sample number of cases in our study. 
      Studies of additional patients are needed to confirm this.

TI  - Expanding the Clinical Spectrum of RFC1 Gene Mutations.
PG  - 167-170
LID - 10.14802/jmd.21117 [doi]
AB  - Biallelic intronic repeat expansion in the replication factor complex unit 1 
      (RFC1) gene has recently been described as a cause of late onset ataxia with 
      degeneration of the cerebellum, sensory pathways and the vestibular apparatus. 
      This condition is termed cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia 
      syndrome (CANVAS). Since the identification of this novel gene mutation, the 
      phenotypic spectrum of RFC1 mutations continues to expand and includes not only 
      CANVAS but also slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia, ataxia with chronic cough 
      (ACC), isolated sensory neuropathy and multisystemic diseases. We present a 
      patient with a genetically confirmed intronic repeat expansion in the RFC1 gene 
      with a symptom complex not described previously.

TI  - RFC1 repeat expansions: A recurrent cause of sensory and autonomic neuropathy 
      with cough and ataxia.
PG  - 2156-2161
LID - 10.1111/ene.15310 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ataxia and cough are rare features in hereditary sensory 
      and autonomic neuropathies (HSAN), a group of diseases of mostly unknown genetic 
      cause. Biallelic repeat expansions in RFC1 are associated with cerebellar ataxia, 
      neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). This study aimed to 
      investigate the prevalence of RFC1 repeat expansions in a cohort of HSAN 
      patients. METHODS: After unremarkable whole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis, we 
      performed repeat-primed PCR to detect intronic RFC1 expansions in 12 HSAN 
      families, who all presented with chronic cough. RESULTS: In these patients, 75% 
      carried biallelic expansions of the pathogenic AAGGG motif. Compared with RFC1-/- 
      cases, RFC1+/+ cases presented more consistently with positive sensory and 
      autonomic symptoms. Afferent ataxia was more severe in the RFC1+/+ cohort and 
      cerebellar ataxia was a common feature (21%). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that 
      RFC1 is a frequent cause of (WES-negative) HSAN with chronic cough and ataxia. 
      The diagnostic yield of RFC1 repeat-primed PCR was surprisingly high, given that 
      HSAN is genetically poorly understood. This combination of HSAN, ataxia, and 
      chronic cough symptoms represents a new nosological entity within the 
      neuropathy-ataxia spectrum.

AB  - An intronic expansion (AAGGG)(exp) in the RFC1 gene has recently been shown to 
      cause recessively inherited cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular 
      areflexia syndrome and, furthermore, a few patients with ataxia and parkinsonism 
      have been reported. We investigated 569 Finnish patients with medicated 
      parkinsonism for RFC1 and found biallelic (AAGGG)(exp) in three 
      non-consanguineous patients with clinically confirmed Parkinson's disease without 
      ataxia suggesting that RFC1-related disorders include Parkinson's disease as 
      well.

TI  - Motor neuron pathology in CANVAS due to RFC1 expansions.
PG  - 2121-2132
LID - 10.1093/brain/awab449 [doi]
AB  - CANVAS caused by RFC1 biallelic expansions is a major cause of inherited sensory 
      neuronopathy. Detection of RFC1 expansion is challenging and CANVAS can be 
      associated with atypical features. We clinically and genetically characterized 50 
      patients, selected based on the presence of sensory neuronopathy confirmed by 
      EMG. We screened RFC1 expansion by PCR, repeat-primed PCR, and Southern blotting 
      of long-range PCR products, a newly developed method. Neuropathological 
      characterization was performed on the brain and spinal cord of one patient. Most 
      patients (88%) carried a biallelic (AAGGG)n expansion in RFC1. In addition to the 
      core CANVAS phenotype (sensory neuronopathy, cerebellar syndrome and vestibular 
      impairment), we observed chronic cough (97%), oculomotor signs (85%), motor 
      neuron involvement (55%), dysautonomia (50%), and parkinsonism (10%). Motor 
      neuron involvement was found for 24 of 38 patients (63.1%). First motor neuron 
      signs, such as brisk reflexes, extensor plantar responses, and/or spasticity, 
      were present in 29% of patients, second motor neuron signs, such as 
      fasciculations, wasting, weakness, or a neurogenic pattern on EMG in 18%, and 
      both in 16%. Mixed motor and sensory neuronopathy was observed in 19% of 
      patients. Among six non-RFC1 patients, one carried a heterozygous AAGGG expansion 
      and a pathogenic variant in GRM1. Neuropathological examination of one RFC1 
      patient with an enriched phenotype, including parkinsonism, dysautonomia, and 
      cognitive decline, showed posterior column and lumbar posterior root atrophy. 
      Degeneration of the vestibulospinal and spinocerebellar tracts was mild. We 
      observed marked astrocytic gliosis and axonal swelling of the synapse between 
      first and second motor neurons in the anterior horn at the lumbar level. The 
      cerebellum showed mild depletion of Purkinje cells, with empty baskets, 
      torpedoes, and astrogliosis characterized by a disorganization of the Bergmann's 
      radial glia. We found neuronal loss in the vagal nucleus. The pars compacta of 
      the substantia nigra was depleted, with widespread Lewy bodies in the locus 
      coeruleus, substantia nigra, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala. We 
      propose new guidelines for the screening of RFC1 expansion, considering different 
      expansion motifs. Here, we developed a new method to more easily detect 
      pathogenic RFC1 expansions. We report frequent motor neuron involvement and 
      different neuronopathy subtypes. Parkinsonism was more prevalent in this cohort 
      than in the general population, 10% versus the expected 1% (P < 0.001). We 
      describe, for the first time, the spinal cord pathology in CANVAS, showing the 
      alteration of posterior columns and roots, astrocytic gliosis and axonal 
      swelling, suggesting motor neuron synaptic dysfunction.

LID - 382
AB  - BACKGROUND: The genetics of cerebellar ataxia is complex. Hundreds of causative 
      genes have been identified, but only a few cause more than single cases. The 
      spectrum of ataxia-causing genes differs considerably between populations. The 
      aim of the study was to investigate the molecular epidemiology of ataxia in the 
      Finnish population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients in hospital database were 
      reviewed for the diagnosis of unspecified ataxia. Acquired ataxias and nongenetic 
      ataxias such as those related to infection, trauma or stroke were excluded. Sixty 
      patients with sporadic ataxia with unknown etiology and 36 patients with familial 
      ataxia of unknown etiology were recruited in the study. Repeat expansions in the 
      SCA genes (ATXN1, 2, 3, 7, 8/OS, CACNA1A, TBP), FXN, and RFC1 were determined. 
      Point mutations in POLG, SPG7 and in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were investigated. 
      In addition, DNA from 8 patients was exome sequenced. RESULTS: A genetic cause of 
      ataxia was found in 33 patients (34.4%). Seven patients had a dominantly 
      inherited repeat expansion in ATXN8/OS. Ten patients had mitochondrial ataxia 
      resulting from mutations in nuclear mitochondrial genes POLG or RARS2, or from a 
      point mutation m.8561C > G or a single deletion in mtDNA. Interestingly, five 
      patients were biallelic for the recently identified pathogenic repeat expansion 
      in RFC1. All the five patients presented with the phenotype of cerebellar ataxia, 
      neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia (CANVAS). Moreover, screening of 54 patients 
      with Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy revealed four additional patients with 
      biallelic repeat expansion in RFC1, but none of them had cerebellar symptoms. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Expansion in ATXN8/OS results in the majority of dominant ataxias in 
      Finland, while mutations in RFC1 and POLG are the most common cause of recessive 
      ataxias. Our results suggest that analysis of RFC1 should be included in the 
      routine diagnostics of idiopathic ataxia and Charcot-Marie-Tooth polyneuropathy.

AB  - A homozygous AAGGG repeat expansion within the RFC1 gene was recently described 
      as a common cause of CANVAS syndrome. We examined 1069 sporadic ALS patients for 
      the presence of this repeat expansion. We did not discover any carriers of the 
      homozygous AAGGG expansion in our ALS cohort, indicating that this form of RFC1 
      repeat expansions is not a common cause of sporadic ALS. However, our study did 
      identify a novel repeat conformation and further expanded on the highly 
      polymorphic nature of the RFC1 locus.

LID - 10.1007/s13760-021-01721-2 [doi]
AB  - Cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) is a 
      late-onset, slowly progressive disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia, 
      sensory neuropathy and bilateral vestibulopathy. Recently, a biallelic intronic 
      AAGGG repeat expansion, (AAGGG)(exp), in the Replication Factor C1 (RFC1) gene 
      was identified as the cause of this disorder. In this study, we describe the 
      phenotypic features of five patients from five different families diagnosed as 
      CANVAS. The mean age at onset was 49.00 +/- 9.05 years (between 34 and 56 years) 
      and the most frequent presenting symptom in CANVAS was gait ataxia, followed by 
      sensory disturbances. Persistent coughing was prominent in three patients, and it 
      preceded the onset of ataxia and sensory symptoms in two patients. Parental 
      consanguinity was present in three patients. Two patients showed symptoms or 
      signs suggesting autonomic involvement. Sural nerve biopsy revealed axonal 
      neuropathy in two patients. The mean age at onset was 49.00 +/- 9.05 years (between 
      34 and 56 years) and the most frequent presenting symptom in CANVAS was gait 
      ataxia, followed by sensory disturbances. Persistent coughing was prominent in 
      three patients, and it preceded the onset of ataxia and sensory symptoms in two 
      patients. Parental consanguinity was present in three patients. Two patients 
      showed symptoms or signs suggesting autonomic involvement. Sural nerve biopsy 
      revealed axonal neuropathy in two patients. Our study describes clinical 
      findings, histopathological features and diagnostic clues of CANVAS from Turkey, 
      a country with a high consanguineous marriage rate. Repeat expansion in the RFC1 
      gene should be considered in all cases with late-onset ataxia, especially when 
      sensory disturbances, vestibular involvement and persistent coughing coexist.

TI  - Genetic polymorphism of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist in Type 1 diabetic 
      children.
PG  - 1536-1541
LID - 10.1038/s41390-021-01569-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL1RN) variable number tandem 
      repeats (VNTRs) are not fully understood in Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). It 
      may affect IL1RN level and modify the disease risk. We aimed to study IL1RN VNTR 
      polymorphism in Egyptian children with T1DM to clarify its potential role as a 
      risk factor for T1DM and its effect on plasma IL1RN level. METHODS: A 
      case-controlled study including 200 children (120 T1DM and 80 controls) was 
      carried on. All children were subjected to genotyping of IL1RN VNTR. Plasma IL1RN 
      was estimated by ELISA. RESULTS: The A1A2 and LS genotypes and A2 allele were 
      significantly higher among cases compared to controls with increased T1DM risk 
      (OR = 5.35, 2.56 and 3.13, respectively). The S allele was significantly elevated 
      in cases compared to controls with 2.09-fold increased risk of having T1DM. The 
      median plasma IL1RN significantly decreased in cases compared to controls. Within 
      cases, IL1RN was significantly decreased in LS versus LL genotype. CONCLUSIONS: 
      There is a strong relationship between IL1RN VNTR and T1DM in Egyptian children. 
      A1A1 genotype, LL genotype, A1 allele, and L allele were protective. A1A2 and LS 
      genotypes, short (S), and A2 alleles were risk factors. IL1RN was decreased in 
      T1DM, especially in LS genotype. IMPACT: The relationship between IL1RN gene 
      polymorphism and risk for T1DM among Egyptian children. Plasma IL1RN protein 
      level in T1DM. Low IL1RN protein level in T1DM patients could be therapeutic 
      targets for IL1RN medications in the future.

TI  - RFC1 expansions are a common cause of idiopathic sensory neuropathy.
PG  - 1542-1550
LID - 10.1093/brain/awab072 [doi]
AB  - After extensive evaluation, one-third of patients affected by polyneuropathy 
      remain undiagnosed and are labelled as having chronic idiopathic axonal 
      polyneuropathy, which refers to a sensory or sensory-motor, axonal, slowly 
      progressive neuropathy of unknown origin. Since a sensory neuropathy/neuronopathy 
      is identified in all patients with genetically confirmed RFC1 cerebellar ataxia, 
      neuropathy, vestibular areflexia syndrome, we speculated that RFC1 expansions 
      could underlie a fraction of idiopathic sensory neuropathies also diagnosed as 
      chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy. We retrospectively identified 225 
      patients diagnosed with chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy (125 sensory 
      neuropathy, 100 sensory-motor neuropathy) from our general neuropathy clinics in 
      Italy and the UK. All patients underwent full neurological evaluation and a blood 
      sample was collected for RFC1 testing. Biallelic RFC1 expansions were identified 
      in 43 patients (34%) with sensory neuropathy and in none with sensory-motor 
      neuropathy. Forty-two per cent of RFC1-positive patients had isolated sensory 
      neuropathy or sensory neuropathy with chronic cough, while vestibular and/or 
      cerebellar involvement, often subclinical, were identified at examination in 58%. 
      Although the sensory ganglia are the primary pathological target of the disease, 
      the sensory impairment was typically worse distally and symmetric, while gait and 
      limb ataxia were absent in two-thirds of the cases. Sensory amplitudes were 
      either globally absent (26%) or reduced in a length-dependent (30%) or non-length 
      dependent pattern (44%). A quarter of RFC1-positive patients had previously 
      received an alternative diagnosis, including Sjogren's syndrome, sensory chronic 
      inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and paraneoplastic neuropathy, while 
      three cases had been treated with immune therapies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The biallelic inheritance of an expanded intronic pentamer 
      (AAGGG)(exp) in the gene encoding replication factor C subunit 1 (RFC1) has been 
      found to be a cause of cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia 
      syndrome (CANVAS). This study describes clinical and genetic features of our 
      patients with clinical suspicion of the syndrome. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective 
      descriptive study from an ataxia database comprising 500 patients. SETTING: The 
      study was performed at the Otorhinolaryngology Department of a hospital in the 
      north of Spain. METHODS: Specific genetic testing for CANVAS was performed in 13 
      patients with clinical suspicion of complete or incomplete syndrome. The clinical 
      diagnosis was supported by quantitative vestibular hypofunction, cerebellar 
      atrophy, and abnormal sensory nerve conduction testing. RESULTS: Nine of 13 (69%) 
      patients met clinical diagnostic criteria for definite CANVAS disease. The first 
      manifestation of the syndrome was lower limb dysesthesia in 8 of 13 patients and 
      gait imbalance in 5 of 13. Eleven of 13 (85%) patients were carriers of the 
      biallelic (AAGGG)(exp) in RFC1. CONCLUSION: A genetic cause of CANVAS has 
      recently been discovered. We propose genetic screening for biallelic expansions 
      of the AAGGG pentamer of RFC1 in all patients with clinical suspicion of CANVAS, 
      since accurate early diagnosis could improve the quality of life of these 
      patients.

TI  - RFC1 AAGGG repeat expansion masquerading as Chronic Idiopathic Axonal 
      Polyneuropathy.
PG  - 4280-4290
LID - 10.1007/s00415-021-10552-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A biallelic intronic AAGGG repeat expansion in the Replication Factor 
      C subunit 1 (RFC1) gene has been recently associated with Cerebellar Ataxia, 
      Neuropathy, Vestibular Areflexia Syndrome, a disorder often presenting as a 
      slowly evolving sensory neuropathy at the onset. "Chronic Idiopathic Axonal 
      Polyneuropathy" (CIAP) is a common indolent axonal neuropathy of adulthood which 
      remains without an identifiable cause despite thorough investigations. METHODS: 
      We screened 234 probands diagnosed with CIAP for a pathogenic biallelic RFC1 
      AAGGG repeat expansion. Patients were selected from 594 consecutive patients with 
      neuropathy referred to our tertiary-care center for a sural nerve biopsy over 
      10 years. RESULTS: The RFC1 AAGGG repeat expansion was common in patients with 
      pure sensory neuropathy (21/40, 53%) and less frequent in cases with 
      predominantly sensory (10/56, 18%, P < 0.001) or sensorimotor (3/138, 2%, 
      P < 0.001) neuropathy. The mutation was associated with sensory ataxia 
      (tau(b) = 0.254, P < 0.001), autonomic disturbances (35% vs 8%, Prevalence Odds 
      Ratio-POR 6.73 CI 95% 2.79-16.2, P < 0.001), retained deep tendon reflexes (score 
      18.0/24 vs 11.5/24, R = 0.275, P < 0.001). On pathology, we observed absent/scant 
      regenerative changes (tau(b) = - 0.362, P < 0.001), concomitant involvement of 
      large (100% and 99%, n.s.), small myelinated (97% vs 81%, POR 7.74 CI 95% 
      1.03-58.4, P = 0.02) and unmyelinated nerve fibers (85% vs 41%, POR 8.52 CI 95% 
      3.17-22.9, P < 0.001). Cerebellar or vestibular involvement was similarly rare in 
      the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the frequent occurrence of the 
      RFC1 AAGGG repeat expansion in patients diagnosed with CIAP and characterizes the 
      clinical and pathological features of the related neuro(no)pathy.

TI  - Whole-Genome Sequencing in Diagnostics of Selected Slovenian Undiagnosed Patients 
      with Rare Disorders.
LID - 10.3390/life11030205 [doi]
LID - 205
AB  - Several patients with rare genetic disorders remain undiagnosed following 
      comprehensive diagnostic testing using whole-exome sequencing (WES). In these 
      patients, pathogenic genetic variants may reside in intronic or regulatory 
      regions or they may emerge through mutational mechanisms not detected by WES. For 
      this reason, we implemented whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in routine clinical 
      diagnostics of patients with undiagnosed genetic disorders and report on the 
      outcome in 30 patients. Criteria for consideration included (1) negative WES, (2) 
      a high likelihood of a genetic cause for the disorders, (3) positive family 
      history, (4) detection of large blocks of homozygosity or (5) detection of a 
      single pathogenic variant in a gene associated with recessive conditions. We 
      successfully discovered a causative genetic variant in 6 cases, a 
      retrotranspositional event in the APC gene, non-coding variants in the intronic 
      region of the OTC gene and the promotor region of the UFM1 gene, repeat expansion 
      in the RFC1 gene and a single exon duplication in the CNGB3 gene. We also 
      discovered one coding variant, an indel, which was missed by variant caller 
      during WES data analysis. Our study demonstrates the impact of WGS in the group 
      of patients with undiagnosed genetic diseases after WES in the clinical setting 
      and the diversity of mutational mechanisms discovered, which would remain 
      undetected using other methods.

TI  - Biallelic RFC1 pentanucleotide repeat expansions in Greek patients with 
      late-onset ataxia.
PG  - 90-94
LID - 10.1111/cge.13960 [doi]
AB  - Cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) has been 
      recently linked to biallelic expansions of a pentanucleotide repeat in the 
      replication factor C subunit 1 (RFC1) gene. Herein, we sought to investigate the 
      presence of pathological RFC1 expansions in selected Greek patients with 
      late-onset ataxia and delineate the phenotypic spectrum of genetically confirmed 
      CANVAS in the Greek population. We screened genetically a total of 77 selected 
      index patients, 67 originating from a cerebellar ataxia cohort and 10 from a 
      hereditary neuropathy cohort. We identified five index cases (6.5%) with 
      biallelic pathological RFC1 expansions, two in the cerebellar ataxia cohort (3%) 
      and three in the neuropathy cohort (30%). Overall, four out of five of cases with 
      full-blown CANVAS and one case with sensory ataxic neuropathy had biallelic 
      pathological expansions. The phenotypic spectrum of positive cases (including two 
      affected siblings) was consistent with previous reports and implied that the 
      sensory neuropathy may be the earliest feature in genetically confirmed CANVAS. 
      Screening for biallelic RFC1 expansions is recommended in all cases with 
      late-onset ataxia of unknown cause, particularly when a sensory neuropathy is 
      present.

      Fingerprinting of Q Fever in Belgium.

AB  - Q fever is a zoonotic disease caused by the bacteria Coxiella burnetii. Domestic 
      ruminants are the primary source for human infection, and the identification of 
      likely contamination routes from the reservoir animals the critical point to 
      implement control programs. This study shows that Q fever is detected in Belgium 
      in abortion of cattle, goat and sheep at a different degree of apparent 
      prevalence (1.93%, 9.19%, and 5.50%, respectively). In addition, and for the 
      first time, it is detected in abortion of alpaca (Vicugna pacos), raising 
      questions on the role of these animals as reservoirs. To determine the 
      relationship between animal and human strains, Multiple Locus Variable-number 
      Tandem Repeat Analysis (MLVA) (n=146), Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) 
      (n=92) and Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) (n=4) methods were used to characterize 
      samples/strains during 2009-2019. Three MLVA clusters (A, B, C) subdivided in 23 
      subclusters (A1-A12, B1-B8, C1-C3) and 3 SNP types (SNP1, SNP2, SNP6) were 
      identified. The SNP2 type/MLVA cluster A was the most abundant and dispersed 
      genotype over the entire territory, but it seemed not responsible for human 
      cases, as it was only present in animal samples. The SNP1/MLVA B and SNP6/MLVA C 
      clusters were mostly found in small ruminant and human samples, with the rare 
      possibility of spillovers in cattle. SNP1/MLVA B cluster was present in all 
      Belgian areas, while the SNP6/MLVA C cluster appeared more concentrated in the 
      Western provinces. A broad analysis of European MLVA profiles confirmed the 
      host-species distribution described for Belgian samples. In silico genotyping 
      (WGS) further identified the spacer types and the genomic groups of C. burnetii 
      Belgian strains: cattle and goat SNP2/MLVA A isolates belonged to ST61 and 
      genomic group III, while the goat SNP1/MLVA B strain was classified as ST33 and 
      genomic group II. In conclusion, Q fever is widespread in all Belgian domestic 
      ruminants and in alpaca. We determined that the public health risk in Belgium is 
      likely linked to specific genomic groups (SNP1/MLVA B and SNP6/MLVA C) mostly 
      found in small ruminant strains. Considering the concordance between Belgian and 
      European results, these considerations could be extended to other European 
      countries.

TI  - Biallelic RFC1-expansion in a French multicentric sporadic ataxia cohort.
PG  - 3337-3343
LID - 10.1007/s00415-021-10499-5 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome 
      (CANVAS) is a recessively inherited multisystem ataxia compromising cerebellar, 
      vestibular, and sensory nerves, which has been associated to a pathogenic 
      AAGGG(n) biallelic expansion repeat in the RFC1 gene. Our objective was to assess 
      its prevalence in a French cohort of patients with idiopathic sporadic late-onset 
      ataxia (ILOA), idiopathic early-onset ataxia (IEOA), or Multiple System Atrophy 
      of Cerebellar type (MSA-C). METHODS: 163 patients were recruited in 3 French 
      tertiary centers: 100 ILOA, 21 IEOA, and 42 patients with possible or probable 
      MSA-C. RESULTS: A pathogenic biallelic RFC1 AAGGG(n) repeat expansion was found 
      in 15 patients: 15/100 in the ILOA group, but none in the IEOA and MSA-C 
      subgroups. 14/15 patients had a CANVAS phenotype. Only 1/15 had isolated 
      cerebellar ataxia, but also shorter biallelic expansions. Two RFC1 AAGGG(n) 
      alleles were found in 78% of patients with a CANVAS phenotype. In one post-mortem 
      case, the pathophysiological involvement of cerebellum and medullar posterior 
      columns was found. CONCLUSION: Our study confirms the genetic heterogeneity of 
      the CANVAS and that RFC1 repeat expansions should be searched for preferentially 
      in case of unexplained ILOA associated with a sensory neuronopathy, but not 
      particularly in patients classified as MSA-C.

LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000011528 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To delineate the full phenotypic spectrum, discriminative features, 
      piloting longitudinal progression data, and sample size calculations of 
      replication factor complex subunit 1 (RFC1) repeat expansions, recently 
      identified as causing cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, vestibular areflexia 
      syndrome (CANVAS). METHODS: Multimodal RFC1 repeat screening (PCR, Southern blot, 
      whole-exome/genome sequencing-based approaches) combined with cross-sectional and 
      longitudinal deep phenotyping in (1) cross-European cohort A (70 families) with 
      >/=2 features of CANVAS or ataxia with chronic cough (ACC) and (2) Turkish cohort B 
      (105 families) with unselected late-onset ataxia. RESULTS: Prevalence of RFC1 
      disease was 67% in cohort A, 14% in unselected cohort B, 68% in clinical CANVAS, 
      and 100% in ACC. RFC1 disease was also identified in Western and Eastern Asian 
      individuals and even by whole-exome sequencing. Visual compensation, sensory 
      symptoms, and cough were strong positive discriminative predictors (>90%) against 
      RFC1-negative patients. The phenotype across 70 RFC1-positive patients was mostly 
      multisystemic (69%), including dysautonomia (62%) and bradykinesia (28%) (overlap 
      with cerebellar-type multiple system atrophy [MSA-C]), postural instability 
      (49%), slow vertical saccades (17%), and chorea or dystonia (11%). Ataxia 
      progression was  approximately 1.3 Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia points per 
      year (32 cross-sectional, 17 longitudinal assessments, follow-up </=9 years [mean 
      3.1 years]) but also included early falls, variable nonlinear phases of 
      MSA-C-like progression (SARA points 2.5-5.5 per year), and premature death. 
      Treatment trials require 330 (1-year trial) and 132 (2-year trial) patients in 
      total to detect 50% reduced progression. CONCLUSIONS: RFC1 disease is frequent 
      and occurs across continents, with CANVAS and ACC as highly diagnostic phenotypes 
      yet as variable, overlapping clusters along a continuous multisystemic disease 
      spectrum, including MSA-C-overlap. Our natural history data help to inform future 
      RFC1 treatment trials. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II 
      evidence that RFC1 repeat expansions are associated with CANVAS and ACC.

AB  - Cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) is a 
      late-onset, multisystem ataxia that remained only clinically defined, until 
      recently, when the discovery of biallelic repeat expansion in the RFC1 gene 
      allowed the genetic link. We describe the first Portuguese familial CANVAS 
      harboring the pathogenic RFC1 expansion. Detail clinical features and course of 
      four affected members are provided. Phenotype characterizations are important as 
      the novel RFC1 mutation is expected to be a major cause of idiopathic late-onset 
      ataxia.

TI  - A novel RFC1 repeat motif (ACAGG) in two Asia-Pacific CANVAS families.
PG  - 2904-2910
LID - 10.1093/brain/awaa263 [doi]
AB  - Cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) is a 
      progressive late-onset, neurological disease. Recently, a pentanucleotide 
      expansion in intron 2 of RFC1 was identified as the genetic cause of CANVAS. We 
      screened an Asian-Pacific cohort for CANVAS and identified a novel RFC1 repeat 
      expansion motif, (ACAGG)exp, in three affected individuals. This motif was 
      associated with additional clinical features including fasciculations and 
      elevated serum creatine kinase. These features have not previously been described 
      in individuals with genetically-confirmed CANVAS. Haplotype analysis showed our 
      patients shared the same core haplotype as previously published, supporting the 
      possibility of a single origin of the RFC1 disease allele. We analysed data from 
      >26 000 genetically diverse individuals in gnomAD to show enrichment of (ACAGG)

TI  - Biallelic Intronic AAGGG Expansion of RFC1 is Related to Multiple System Atrophy.
PG  - 1132-1143
LID - 10.1002/ana.25902 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A recessive biallelic repeat expansion, (AAGGG)(exp) , in the RFC1 
      gene has been reported to be a frequent cause of late-onset ataxia. For 
      cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS), the 
      recessive biallelic (AAGGG)(exp) genotype was present in ~92% of cases. This 
      study aimed to examine whether the pentanucleotide repeat (PNR) was related to 
      multiple system atrophy (MSA), which shares a spectrum of symptoms with CANVAS. 
      METHODS: In this study, we screened the pathogenic (AAGGG)(exp) repeat and 5 
      other PNRs in 104 Chinese sporadic adult-onset ataxia of unknown aetiology (SAOA) 
      patients, 282 MSA patients, and 203 unaffected individuals. Multiple molecular 
      genetic tests were used, including long-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 
      repeat-primed PCR (RP-PCR), Sanger sequencing, and Southern blot. Comprehensive 
      clinical assessments were conducted, including neurological examination, 
      neuroimaging, nerve electrophysiology, and examination of vestibular function. 
      RESULTS: We identified biallelic (AAGGG)(exp) in 1 SAOA patient and 3 MSA 
      patients. Additionally, 1 MSA patient had the (AAGGG)(exp) /(AAAGG)(exp) genotype 
      with uncertain pathogenicity. We also described the carrier frequency for 
      different PNRs in our cohorts. Furthermore, we summarized the distinct phenotypes 
      of affected patients, suggesting that biallelic (AAGGG)(exp) in RFC1 could be 
      associated with MSA and should be screened routinely in the MSA diagnostic 
      workflow. INTERPRETATION: Our results expanded the clinical phenotypic spectrum 
      of RFC1-related disorders and raised the possibility that MSA might share the 
      same genetic background as CANVAS, which is crucial for re-evaluating the current 
      CANVAS and MSA diagnostic criteria. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:1132-1143.

AB  - The ataxias are a group of disorders that manifest with balance, movement, speech 
      and visual problems. They can arise due to dysfunction of the cerebellum, the 
      vestibular system and/or the sensory neurons. Genetic defects are a common cause 
      of chronic ataxia, particularly common are repeat expansions in this group of 
      conditions. Co-occurrence of cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and vestibular 
      areflexia syndrome has been termed CANVAS. Although CANVAS is a rare syndrome, on 
      discovery of biallelic expansions in the second intron of replication factor C 
      subunit 1 (RFC1) gene, we and others have found the phenotype is broad and RFC1 
      expansions are a common cause of late-onset progressive ataxia.We aim to provide 
      a review and update on recent developments in CANVAS and populations, where the 
      disorder has been reported. We have also optimised a protocol for RFC1 expansion 
      screening which is described herein and expanded phenotype after analysing 
      late-onset ataxia patients from around the world.

TI  - Clinical spectrum of the pentanucleotide repeat expansion in the RFC1 gene in 
      ataxia syndromes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical significance of an intronic biallelic 
      pentanucleotide repeat expansion in the gene encoding replication factor C 
      subunit 1 (RFC1) in patients with late-onset cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and 
      vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS), in patients with other ataxias, and in 
      healthy controls by comprehensive genetic analyses. METHODS: In this case-control 
      study, we included 457 individuals comprising 26 patients with complete or 
      incomplete CANVAS, 70 patients with late-onset cerebellar ataxia, 208 healthy 
      controls, and 153 individuals from 39 multigenerational families without ataxia 
      to determine repeat stability. All 96 patients were screened for the repeat 
      expansion by duplex PCR. To further characterize the repeat type and lengths, we 
      used fragment length analysis, repeat-primed PCR, Sanger sequencing, and Southern 
      blotting. Expression of RFC1 and the neighboring gene WDR19 were determined by 
      quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Massive biallelic pentanucleotide expansions were 
      found in 15/17 patients with complete CANVAS (88%), in 2/9 patients with 
      incomplete CANVAS (22%), in 4/70 patients with unspecified, late-onset cerebellar 
      ataxia (6%), but not in controls. In patients, the expansion comprised 800-1,000 
      mostly AAGGG repeats. Nonmassively expanded repeat numbers were in the range of 
      7-137 repeats and relatively stable during transmission. Expression of RFC1 and 
      WDR19 were unchanged and RFC1 intron retention was not found. CONCLUSIONS: A 
      biallelic pentanucleotide repeat expansion is a frequent cause of CANVAS and 
      found in a considerable number of patients with an incomplete clinical 
      presentation or other forms of cerebellar ataxia. The mechanism by which the 
      repeat expansions are causing disease remains unclear and warrants further 
      investigations.

TI  - A Maori specific RFC1 pathogenic repeat configuration in CANVAS, likely due to a 
      founder allele.

AB  - Cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and bilateral vestibular areflexia syndrome 
      (CANVAS) is a recently recognized neurodegenerative disease with onset in mid- to 
      late adulthood. The genetic basis for a large proportion of Caucasian patients 
      was recently shown to be the biallelic expansion of a pentanucleotide (AAGGG)n 
      repeat in RFC1. Here, we describe the first instance of CANVAS genetic testing in 
      New Zealand Maori and Cook Island Maori individuals. We show a novel, possibly 
      population-specific CANVAS configuration (AAAGG)10-25(AAGGG)exp, which was the 
      cause of CANVAS in all patients. There were no apparent phenotypic differences 
      compared with European CANVAS patients. Presence of a common disease haplotype 
      among this cohort suggests this novel repeat expansion configuration is a founder 
      effect in this population, which may indicate that CANVAS will be especially 
      prevalent in this group. Haplotype dating estimated the most recent common 
      ancestor at  approximately 1430 ce. We also show the same core haplotype as previously 
      described, supporting a single origin of the CANVAS mutation.

TI  - RFC1 repeat expansion in Japanese patients with late-onset cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 1143-1147
LID - 10.1038/s10038-020-0807-x [doi]
AB  - Recently, the expansion of an intronic AAGGG repeat in the replication factor C 
      subunit 1 (RFC1) gene was reported to cause cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, 
      vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). In Europeans, the expansion accounted for 
      22% of sporadic patients with late-onset ataxia. We genotyped 37 Japanese 
      patients comprising 25 familial (autosomal recessive or undecided transmission) 
      and 12 sporadic ones with late-onset ataxia. We found intronic repeat expansions 
      in RFC1 in three (12%) of the familial patients and one (8.5%) of the sporadic 
      ones. Although our cohort study was small, the disease frequency in Japanese 
      patients with CANVAS might be lower than that in European ones. In addition, we 
      found biallelic ACAGG repeat expansion in one patient, indicating ACAGG repeat 
      expansion might cause CANVAS. Clinically, we found one patient with sleep apnea 
      syndrome, which has not been reported previously. Thus, this study might expand 
      the clinical and genetic spectrum of CANVAS.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the prevalence of pathogenic repeat expansions in 
      replication factor C subunit 1 (RFC1) and disabled adaptor protein 1 (DAB1) in an 
      undiagnosed ataxia cohort from North America. METHODS: A cohort of 596 
      predominantly adult-onset patients with undiagnosed familial or sporadic 
      cerebellar ataxia was evaluated at a tertiary referral ataxia center and excluded 
      for common genetic causes of cerebellar ataxia. Patients were then screened for 
      the presence of pathogenic repeat expansions in RFC1 (AAGGG) and DAB1 (ATTTC) 
      using fluorescent repeat-primed PCR (RP-PCR). Two additional undiagnosed ataxia 
      cohorts from different centers, totaling 302 and 13 patients, respectively, were 
      subsequently screened for RFC1, resulting in a combined 911 subjects tested. 
      RESULTS: In the initial cohort, 41 samples were identified with 1 expanded allele 
      in the RFC1 gene (6.9%), and 9 had 2 expanded alleles (1.5%). For the additional 
      cohorts, we found 20 heterozygous samples (6.6%) and 17 biallelic samples (5.6%) 
      in the larger cohort and 1 heterozygous sample (7.7%) and 3 biallelic samples 
      (23%) in the second. In total, 29 patients were identified with biallelic repeat 
      expansions in RFC1 (3.2%). Of these 29 patients, 8 (28%) had a clinical diagnosis 
      of cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS), 14 
      had cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy (48%), 4 had pure cerebellar ataxia (14%), 
      and 3 had spinocerebellar ataxia (10%). No patients were identified with 
      expansions in the DAB1 gene (spinocerebellar ataxia type 37). CONCLUSIONS: In a 
      large undiagnosed ataxia cohort from North America, biallelic pathogenic repeat 
      expansion in RFC1 was observed in 3.2%. Testing should be strongly considered in 
      patients with ataxia, especially those with CANVAS or neuropathy.

AB  - Moraxella catarrhalis is a human-adapted, opportunistic bacterial pathogen of the 
      respiratory mucosa. Although asymptomatic colonization of the nasopharynx is 
      common, M. catarrhalis can ascend into the middle ear, where it is a prevalent 
      causative agent of otitis media in children, or enter the lower respiratory 
      tract, where it is associated with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive 
      pulmonary disease in adults. Phase variation is the high frequency, random, 
      reversible switching of gene expression that allows bacteria to adapt to 
      different host microenvironments and evade host defences, and is most commonly 
      mediated by simple DNA sequence repeats. Bioinformatic analysis of five closed M. 
      catarrhalis genomes identified 17 unique simple DNA sequence repeat tracts that 
      were variable between strains, indicating the potential to mediate phase variable 
      expression of the associated genes. Assays designed to assess simple sequence 
      repeat variation under conditions mimicking host infection demonstrated that 
      phase variation of uspA1 (ubiquitous surface protein A1) from high to low 
      expression occurs over 72 hours of biofilm passage, while phase variation of 
      uspA2 (ubiquitous surface protein A2) to high expression variants occurs during 
      repeated exposure to human serum, as measured by mRNA levels. We also identify 
      and confirm the variable expression of two novel phase variable genes encoding a 
      Type III DNA methyltransferase (modO), and a conserved hypothetical permease 
      (MC25239_RS00020). These data reveal the repertoire of phase variable genes 
      mediated by simple sequence repeats in M. catarrhalis and demonstrate that 
      modulation of expression under conditions mimicking human infection is attributed 
      to changes in simple sequence repeat length.

TI  - Increasing incidence of group B streptococcus neonatal infections in the 
      Netherlands is associated with clonal expansion of CC17 and CC23.

AB  - Group B streptococcus (GBS) is the leading cause of neonatal invasive disease 
      worldwide. In the Netherlands incidence of the disease increased despite 
      implementation of preventive guidelines. We describe a genomic analysis of 1345 
      GBS isolates from neonatal (age 0-89 days) invasive infections in the Netherlands 
      reported between 1987 and 2016. Most isolates clustered into one of five major 
      lineages: CC17 (39%), CC19 (25%), CC23 (18%), CC10 (9%) and CC1 (7%). There was a 
      significant rise in the number of infections due to isolates from CC17 and CC23. 
      Phylogenetic clustering analysis revealed that this was caused by expansion of 
      specific sub-lineages, designated CC17-A1, CC17-A2 and CC23-A1. Dating of 
      phylogenetic trees estimated that these clones diverged in the 1960s/1970s, 
      representing historical rather than recently emerged clones. For CC17-A1 the 
      expansion correlated with acquisition of a new phage, carrying gene encoding a 
      putative cell-surface protein. Representatives of CC17-A1, CC17-A2 and CC23-A1 
      clones were identified in datasets from other countries demonstrating their 
      global distribution.

AB  - We screened the RFC1 intronic AAGGG repeat expansions in late-onset ataxia cases, 
      MSA patients and controls. The data suggested that no biallelic repeat expansion 
      carrier was found in our cohort and the heterozygous intronic AAGGG repeat 
      expansions may not lead to an increased risk of late-onset ataxia or MSA.

TI  - Long-read sequencing identifies the pathogenic nucleotide repeat expansion in 
      RFC1 in a Japanese case of CANVAS.
PG  - 475-480

AB  - Recently, a recessively inherited intronic repeat expansion in replication factor 
      C1 (RFC1) was identified in cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and bilateral 
      vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). Here, we describe a Japanese case of 
      genetically confirmed CANVAS with autonomic failure and auditory hallucination. 
      The case showed impaired uptake of iodine-123-metaiodobenzylguanidine and 
      (123)I-ioflupane in the cardiac sympathetic nerve and dopaminergic neurons, 
      respectively, by single-photon emission computed tomography. Long-read sequencing 
      identified biallelic pathogenic (AAGGG)n nucleotide repeat expansion in RFC1 and 
      heterozygous benign (TAAAA)n and (TAGAA)n expansions in brain expressed, 
      associated with NEDD4 (BEAN1). Enrichment of the repeat regions in RFC1 and BEAN1 
      using a Cas9-mediated system clearly distinguished between pathogenic and benign 
      repeat expansions. The haplotype around RFC1 indicated that the (AAGGG)n 
      expansion in our case was on the same ancestral allele as that of European cases. 
      Thus, long-read sequencing facilitates precise genetic diagnosis of diseases with 
      complex repeat structures and various expansions.

TI  - Cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, vestibular areflexia syndrome due to RFC1 repeat 
      expansion.
PG  - 480-490
LID - 10.1093/brain/awz418 [doi]
AB  - Ataxia, causing imbalance, dizziness and falls, is a leading cause of 
      neurological disability. We have recently identified a biallelic intronic AAGGG 
      repeat expansion in replication factor complex subunit 1 (RFC1) as the cause of 
      cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) and a major 
      cause of late onset ataxia. Here we describe the full spectrum of the disease 
      phenotype in our first 100 genetically confirmed carriers of biallelic repeat 
      expansions in RFC1 and identify the sensory neuropathy as a common feature in all 
      cases to date. All patients were Caucasian and half were sporadic. Patients 
      typically reported progressive unsteadiness starting in the sixth decade. A dry 
      spasmodic cough was also frequently associated and often preceded by decades the 
      onset of walking difficulty. Sensory symptoms, oscillopsia, dysautonomia and 
      dysarthria were also variably associated. The disease seems to follow a pattern 
      of spatial progression from the early involvement of sensory neurons, to the 
      later appearance of vestibular and cerebellar dysfunction. Half of the patients 
      needed walking aids after 10 years of disease duration and a quarter were 
      wheelchair dependent after 15 years. Overall, two-thirds of cases had full 
      CANVAS. Sensory neuropathy was the only manifestation in 15 patients. Sixteen 
      patients additionally showed cerebellar involvement, and six showed vestibular 
      involvement. The disease is very likely to be underdiagnosed. Repeat expansion in 
      RFC1 should be considered in all cases of sensory ataxic neuropathy, 
      particularly, but not only, if cerebellar dysfunction, vestibular involvement and 
      cough coexist.

TI  - C9orf72 and smcr8 mutant mice reveal MTORC1 activation due to impaired lysosomal

AB  - How lysosome and MTORC1 signaling interact remains elusive in terminally 
      differentiated cells. A G4C2 repeat expansion in C9orf72 is the most common cause 
      of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) 
      (C9ALS-FTD). We previously identified a C9orf72-SMCR8-containing complex. Here we 
      found that c9orf72 and smcr8 double-knockout (dKO) mice exhibit similar but more 
      severe immune defects than the individual knockouts. In c9orf72 or smcr8 mutant 
      macrophages, lysosomal degradation and exocytosis were impaired due to the 
      disruption of autolysosome acidification. As a result of impaired lysosomal 
      degradation, MTOR protein was aberrantly increased, resulting in MTORC1 signaling 
      overactivation. Inhibition of hyperactive MTORC1 partially rescued macrophage 
      dysfunction, splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy in c9orf72 or smcr8 mutant mice. 
      Pharmacological inhibition of lysosomal degradation upregulated MTOR protein and 
      MTORC1 signaling in differentiated wild-type macrophages, which resemble 
      phenotypes in KO mice. In contrast, C9orf72 or Smcr8 depletion in proliferating 
      macrophages decreased MTORC1 signaling. Our studies causatively link 
      C9orf72-SMCR8's cellular functions in lysosomal degradation, exocytosis, and 
      MTORC1 signaling with their organism-level immune regulation, suggesting cell 
      state (proliferation vs. differentiation)-dependent regulation of MTOR signaling 
      via lysosomes.Abbreviations: ALS: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; ATG13: autophagy

TI  - Investigation of the RFC1 Repeat Expansion in a Canadian and a Brazilian Ataxia 
      Cohort: Identification of Novel Conformations.
PG  - 1219
LID - 10.3389/fgene.2019.01219 [doi]
LID - 1219
AB  - A biallelic pentanucleotide expansion in the RFC1 gene has been reported to be a 
      common cause of late-onset ataxia. In the general population, four different 
      repeat conformations are observed: wild type sequence AAAAG (11 repeats) and 
      longer expansions of either AAAAG, AAAGG or AAGGG sequences. However only the 
      biallelic AAGGG expansions were reported to cause late-onset ataxia. In this 
      study, we aimed to assess the prevalence and nature of RFC1 repeat expansions in 
      three cohorts of adult-onset ataxia cases: Brazilian (n = 23) and Canadian (n = 
      26) cases that are negative for the presence of variants in other known 
      ataxia-associated genes, as well as a cohort of randomly selected Canadian cases 
      (n = 128) without regard to a genetic diagnosis. We identified the biallelic 
      AAGGG expansion in only one Brazilian family which presented two affected 
      siblings, and in one Canadian case. We also observed two new repeat 
      conformations, AAGAG and AGAGG, which suggests the pentanucleotide expansion 
      sequence has a dynamic nature. To assess the frequency of these new repeat 
      conformations in the general population, we screened 163 healthy individuals and 
      observed the AAGAG expansion to be more frequent in cases than in control 
      individuals. While additional studies will be necessary to asses the pathogenic 
      impact of biallelic genotypes that include the novel expanded conformations, 
      their occurrence should nonetheless be examined in future studies.

TI  - Plasma Homocysteine and Polymorphisms of Genes Involved in Folate Metabolism 
      Correlate with DNMT1 Gene Methylation Levels.
LID - 10.3390/metabo9120298 [doi]
LID - 298
AB  - DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) is responsible for the maintenance of DNA 
      methylation patterns during cell division. Several human diseases are 
      characterized by impaired DNMT1 gene methylation, but less is known about the 
      factors that regulate DNMT1 promoter methylation levels. Dietary folates and 
      related B-vitamins are essential micronutrients for DNA methylation processes, 
      and we performed the present study to investigate the contribution of circulating 
      folate, vitamin B12, homocysteine, and common polymorphisms in folate pathway 
      genes to the DNMT1 gene methylation levels. We investigated DNMT1 gene 
      methylation levels in peripheral blood DNA samples from 215 healthy individuals. 
      All the DNA samples were genotyped for MTHFR 677C > T (rs1801133) and 1298A > C 
      (rs1801131), MTRR 66A > G (rs1801394), MTR 2756A > G (rs1805087), SLC19A1 (RFC1) 
      80G > A (rs1051266), TYMS 28-bp tandem repeats (rs34743033) and 1494 6-bp 
      insertion/deletion (indel) (rs34489327), DNMT3A -448A > G (rs1550117), and DNMT3B 
      -149C > T (rs2424913) polymorphisms. Circulating homocysteine, folate, and 
      vitamin B12 levels were available from 158 of the recruited individuals. We 
      observed an inverse correlation between plasma homocysteine and DNMT1 methylation 
      levels. Furthermore, both MTR rs1805087 and TYMS rs34743033 polymorphisms showed 
      a statistically significant effect on DNMT1 methylation levels. The present study 
      revealed several correlations between the folate metabolic pathway and DNMT1 
      promoter methylation that could be of relevance for those disorders characterized 
      by altered DNA methylation.

AB  - Bacillus anthracis, the causative pathogen of anthrax, is a spore-forming, 
      environmentally maintained bacterium that continues to be a veterinary health 
      problem with outbreaks occurring primarily in wildlife and livestock. Globally, 
      the genetic populations of B. anthracis include multiple lineages, and each may 
      have different ecological requirements and geographical distributions. It is, 
      therefore, essential to identify environmental associations within lineages to 
      predict geographical distributions and risk areas with improved accuracy. Here, 
      we model the ecological niche and predict the geography of the most widespread 
      sublineage of B. anthracis in the continental United States using updated 
      MERRA-derived (Modern Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications; 
      the NASA atmospheric data reanalysis of satellite information with multiple data 
      products) bioclimate variables (i.e., MERRAclim data) and updated soil variables. 
      We filter the occurrence data associated with the A1.a/Western North American 
      sub-lineage of B. anthracis from historical anthrax outbreaks using the 
      multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat system. In addition, we also 
      incorporate recent cases associated with B. anthracis A1.a sub-lineage from 2008 
      to 2012 in Montana, Colorado, and Texas. Our results provide the predicted 
      distribution of the A1.a sub-lineage of B. anthracis for the United States with 
      better predictive accuracy and higher spatial resolution than previous estimates. 
      Our prediction serves as an improved disease risk map to better inform anthrax 
      surveillance and control in the United States, particularly the Dakotas and 
      Montana where this sub-lineage is persistent.

TI  - Association of Polymorphisms in Genes Involved in One-Carbon Metabolism with 
      MTHFR Methylation Levels.
LID - 10.3390/ijms20153754 [doi]
LID - 3754
AB  - Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is a pivotal enzyme in the one-carbon 
      metabolism, a metabolic pathway required for DNA synthesis and methylation 
      reactions. MTHFR hypermethylation, resulting in reduced gene expression, can 
      contribute to several human disorders, but little is still known about the 
      factors that regulate MTHFR methylation levels. We performed the present study to 
      investigate if common polymorphisms in one-carbon metabolism genes contribute to 
      MTHFR methylation levels. MTHFR methylation was assessed in peripheral blood DNA 
      samples from 206 healthy subjects with methylation-sensitive high-resolution 
      melting (MS-HRM); genotyping was performed for MTHFR 677C>T (rs1801133) and 
      1298A>C (rs1801131), MTRR 66A>G (rs1801394), MTR 2756A>G (rs1805087), SLC19A1 
      (RFC1) 80G>A (rs1051266), TYMS 28-bp tandem repeats (rs34743033) and 1494 6-bp 
      ins/del (rs34489327), DNMT3A -448A>G (rs1550117), and DNMT3B -149C>T (rs2424913) 
      polymorphisms. We observed a statistically significant effect of the DNMT3B 
      -149C>T polymorphism on mean MTHFR methylation levels, and particularly CT and TT 
      carriers showed increased methylation levels than CC carriers. The present study 
      revealed an association between a functional polymorphism of DNMT3B and MTHFR 
      methylation levels that could be of relevance in those disorders, such as inborn 
      defects, metabolic disorders and cancer, that have been linked to impaired DNA 
      methylation.

AB  - Genomic technologies such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) are revolutionizing 
      molecular diagnostics and clinical medicine. However, these approaches have 
      proven inefficient at identifying pathogenic repeat expansions. Here, we apply a 
      collection of bioinformatics tools that can be utilized to identify either known 
      or novel expanded repeat sequences in NGS data. We performed genetic studies of a 
      cohort of 35 individuals from 22 families with a clinical diagnosis of cerebellar 
      ataxia with neuropathy and bilateral vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). 
      Analysis of whole-genome sequence (WGS) data with five independent algorithms 
      identified a recessively inherited intronic repeat expansion [(AAGGG)(exp)] in 
      the gene encoding Replication Factor C1 (RFC1). This motif, not reported in the 
      reference sequence, localized to an Alu element and replaced the reference 
      (AAAAG)(11) short tandem repeat. Genetic analyses confirmed the pathogenic 
      expansion in 18 of 22 CANVAS-affected families and identified a core ancestral 
      haplotype, estimated to have arisen in Europe more than twenty-five thousand 
      years ago. WGS of the four RFC1-negative CANVAS-affected families identified 
      plausible variants in three, with genomic re-diagnosis of SCA3, spastic ataxia of 
      the Charlevoix-Saguenay type, and SCA45. This study identified the genetic basis 
      of CANVAS and demonstrated that these improved bioinformatics tools increase the 
      diagnostic utility of WGS to determine the genetic basis of a heterogeneous group 
      of clinically overlapping neurogenetic disorders.

      *1*28 rectal cancer patients in neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT). This is an 
      expansion study for *1*1 patients. METHODS: Patients with clinical stage T3-4, 
      N0-2 rectal cancer eligible for preoperative chemoradiotherapy were screened for 
      the UGT1A1*28 genotype. A total of 52 patients with the *1*1 genotype were 
      enrolled. Whole-pelvic intensity-modulated radiation therapy was given in 50 
      Gy/25 fractions. Concurrently, irinotecan of 80 mg/m(2) and capecitabine of 625 
      mg/m(2) twice daily from Monday to Friday were administered weekly. Primary 
      endpoint was toxicities; secondary endpoints included pathological complete 
      response (pCR), tumour-regression grading, treatment compliance, overall 
      survival, local recurrence and disease-free survival. RESULTS: All patients 
      completed capecitabine-based radiotherapy as scheduled, and 42 (81%) patients 
      completed more than three cycles of weekly irinotecan. Overall, grade 3/4 
      toxicities were observed in 20 cases, including 11 leucopenia, 10 neutropenia and 
      12 diarrhoea. Forty-three patients (83%) underwent a radical surgery, and 12 were 
      evaluated as pCR. Another four patients accepted a watch-and-wait strategy 
      because of clinical complete response (CCR). CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated 
      manageable toxicities and an encouraging CCR rate for UGT1A1 *1*1 genotype in an 
      enhanced neoadjuvant therapy. A phase III trial is ongoing to evaluate the value 
      of irinotecan in neoadjuvant therapy (CinClare) [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: 
      NCT02605265].

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study genetic causes of the low frequency of Huntington disease 
      (HD) in the Finnish population, we determined HTT haplogroups in the population 
      and patients with HD and analyzed intergenerational Cytosine-Adenosine-Guanosine 
      (CAG) stability. METHODS: A national cohort of patients with HD was used to 
      identify families with mutant HTT (mHTT). HTT haplogroups were determined in 225 
      archival samples from patients and from 292 population samples. CAG repeats were 
      phased with HTT haplotypes using data from parent-offspring pairs and other mHTT 
      carriers in the family. RESULTS: The allele frequencies of HTT haplotypes in the 
      Finnish population differed from those in 411 non-Finnish European subjects (p < 
      0.00001). The frequency of haplogroup A was lower than that in Europeans and 
      haplogroup C was higher. Haplogroup A alleles were significantly more common in 
      patients than in controls. Among patients with HD haplotypes A1 and A2 were more 
      frequent than among the controls (p = 0.003). The mean size of the CAG repeat 
      change was +1.38 units in paternal transmissions being larger than that (-0.17) 
      in maternal transmissions (p = 0.008). CAG repeats on haplogroup A increased by 
      3.18 CAG units in paternal transmissions, but only by 0.11 units in maternal 
      transmissions (p = 0.008), whereas haplogroup C repeat lengths decreased in both 
      paternal and maternal transmissions. CONCLUSIONS: The low frequency of HD in 
      Finland is partly explained by the low frequency of the HD-associated haplogroup 
      A in the Finnish population. There were remarkable differences in 
      intergenerational CAG repeat dynamics that depended on HTT haplotype and parent 
      gender.

TI  - Biallelic expansion of an intronic repeat in RFC1 is a common cause of late-onset 
      ataxia.
PG  - 649-658
LID - 10.1038/s41588-019-0372-4 [doi]
AB  - Late-onset ataxia is common, often idiopathic, and can result from cerebellar, 
      proprioceptive, or vestibular impairment; when in combination, it is also termed 
      cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). We used 
      non-parametric linkage analysis and genome sequencing to identify a biallelic 
      intronic AAGGG repeat expansion in the replication factor C subunit 1 (RFC1) gene 
      as the cause of familial CANVAS and a frequent cause of late-onset ataxia, 
      particularly if sensory neuronopathy and bilateral vestibular areflexia coexist. 
      The expansion, which occurs in the poly(A) tail of an AluSx3 element and differs 
      in both size and nucleotide sequence from the reference (AAAAG)(11) allele, does 
      not affect RFC1 expression in patient peripheral and brain tissue, suggesting no 
      overt loss of function. These data, along with an expansion carrier frequency of 
      0.7% in Europeans, implies that biallelic AAGGG expansion in RFC1 is a frequent 
      cause of late-onset ataxia.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease that affects 
      the ileum and is associated with increased cytokines. Although interleukin (IL)6, 
      IL17, IL21, and IL22 are increased in Crohn's disease and are associated with 
      disrupted epithelial regeneration, little is known about their effects on the 
      intestinal stem cells (ISCs) that mediate tissue repair. We hypothesized that ILs 
      may target ISCs and reduce ISC-driven epithelial renewal. METHODS: A screen of 
      IL6, IL17, IL21, or IL22 was performed on ileal mouse organoids. Computational 
      modeling was used to predict microenvironment cytokine concentrations. Organoid 
      size, survival, proliferation, and differentiation were characterized by 
      morphometrics, quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and 
      immunostaining on whole organoids or isolated ISCs. ISC function was assayed 
      using serial passaging to single cells followed by organoid quantification. 
      Single-cell RNA sequencing was used to assess Il22ra1 expression patterns in ISCs 
      and transit-amplifying (TA) progenitors. An IL22-transgenic mouse was used to 
      confirm the impact of increased IL22 on proliferative cells in vivo. RESULTS: 
      High IL22 levels caused decreased ileal organoid survival, however, resistant 
      organoids grew larger and showed increased proliferation over controls. Il22ra1 
      was expressed on only a subset of ISCs and TA progenitors. IL22-treated ISCs did 
      not show appreciable differentiation defects, but ISC biomarker expression and 
      self-renewal-associated pathway activity was reduced and accompanied by an 
      inhibition of ISC expansion. In vivo, chronically increased IL22 levels, similar 
      to predicted microenvironment levels, showed increases in proliferative cells in 
      the TA zone with no increase in ISCs. CONCLUSIONS: Increased IL22 limits ISC 
      expansion in favor of increased TA progenitor cell expansion.

TI  - Ethnic variation of IL-4 intron 3 VNTR gene polymorphism; its association with 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus and its complication (neuropathy) in Egyptian subjects.
PG  - 635-640
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.b.32647 [doi]
AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has multigenetic and environmental interactive 
      factors. Although diabetic neuropathies (DPN) are the most common, but at the 
      same time, the least recognized and understood long-term complication of 
      diabetes. This study aimed to investigate the association of IL-4 VNTR gene 
      polymorphism with T2DM complicated with neuropathy in Egyptian subjects. This is 
      a case control study including 102 T2DM Egyptian patients, plus 188 unrelated 
      healthy individuals as controls. They were evaluated for variable number tandem 
      repeat (VNTR); 70 base pair repeats located in the intron 3; of IL-4 gene using 
      the PCR technique. Homozygote frequency of the three-repeat allele (A1/A1) 
      genotype of IL-4 VNTR was nearly equal among diabetic cases and controls (60.8% 
      vs. 62.2%, respectively). Heterozygous frequency of (A1/A2) genotype was higher 
      among controls compared to cases (33.5% vs. 19.6%, respectively) but not 
      statistically significant. The (A2) allele had a significantly higher frequency 
      in diabetic cases compared to controls (29.3% vs. 21.0%, respectively) while the 
      (A1) allele had lower frequency but not significant one (70.7% vs. 79.0%, 
      respectively). Comparing cases complicated with diabetic neuropathy vs. 
      noncomplicated cases regarding their polymorphic IL-4 (VNTR) genotypes revealed a 
      nonsignificant lower frequency of (A1A1) genotype (57.1% vs. 65.1%, respectively, 
      p = .57) with a higher combined (A2A2 + A1/A2) genotype frequency (42.9% vs. 
      34.9%, respectively). Only two haplotypes (A1) & (A2) of IL-4 (VNTR) gene were 
      recognized among Egyptian population; (A2) allele may influence in diabetes but 
      not its complication (neuropathy) among Egyptian diabetic patients.

AB  - The effects of formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) on effector T cells and 
      inflammation-causing tissue-resident cells are not well known. Here, we explored 
      the effect of FPR activation on efferent T cell responses in models of rheumatoid 
      arthritis (RA) and on the expansion of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). 
      Compound 43 (Cpd43; FPR1/2 agonist) was administered to mice with 
      collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) or antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) after disease 
      onset. Joint inflammation/damage and immunity were assessed. FLS were cultured 
      with Cpd43 to test its effects on cell apoptosis and proliferation. To explore 
      the effects of endogenous FPR2 ligands on FLS proliferation, FLS FPR2 was blocked 
      or Annexin A1 (AnxA1) expression silenced. Cpd43 reduced arthritis severity in 
      both models. In CIA, Cpd43 decreased CD4 T cell proliferation and survival and 
      increased the production of the protective cytokine, IFNgamma, in lymph nodes. In 
      AIA, Cpd43 increased CD4 apoptosis and production of the anti-inflammatory IL-4, 
      while augmenting the proportion of splenic regulatory T cells and their 
      expression of IL-2Ralpha. In both models, Cpd43 increased CD4 IL-17A production, 
      without affecting humoral immunity. FPR2 inhibitors reversed Cpd43-mediated 
      effects on AIA and T cell immunity. Cpd43 decreased TNF-induced FLS proliferation 
      and augmented FLS apoptosis in association with intracellular FPR2 accumulation, 
      while endogenous AnxA1 and FPR2 reduced FLS proliferation via the ERK and NFkappaB 
      pathways. Overall, FPR activation inhibits the expansion of arthritogenic 
      effector CD4 T cells and FLS, and reduces joint injury in experimental arthritis. 
      This suggests the therapeutic potential of FPR ligation for the treatment of RA.

TI  - Investigation of the role of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist VNTR variant on 
      the Behcet's disease.
PG  - 27-31
LID - 10.5152/eurjrheum.2017.16102 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Behcet's disease (BD), a chronic multisystem inflammatory disorder, is 
      mainly characterized by relapsing periods of a wide range of clinical symptoms. 
      Several cytokine genes may play important roles in the pathogenesis of BD. 
      Therefore, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) gene 86bp variable number 
      tandem repeat (VNTR) variant was investigated in patients with BD in a Turkish 
      population. METHODS: One hundred nine patients (60 females, 49 males; the mean 
      age+/-standard deviation [SD] was 36.56+/-9.571 years) with BD and one hundred 
      healthy individuals (54 females, 46 males; the mean age+/-SD was 36.64+/-2.294 years) 
      were examined in the study. For genotyping, polymerase chain reaction-restriction 
      fragment length polymorphism analysis was employed. Data were analyzed using 
      Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) 22.0 (IBM Corp.; Armonk, NY, USA) 
      (p<0.05). RESULTS: The genotype distribution and allele frequencies of the IL-1Ra 
      VNTR variant did not differ significantly between the patients and the controls 
      (p>0.05). The frequency of the a1/a1, a1/a2 genotypes and a1, a2 alleles were the 
      most common both in patients and healthy controls (p=0.37, p=0.26, and p=0.53, 
      respectively). Also, no statistically significant difference was found between 
      the IL-1Ra VNTR variant genotypes and clinical characteristics (p>0.05). 
      CONCLUSION: The results of this study do not support an association between the 
      IL-1Ra VNTR variant and the risk of BD in a Turkish population. However, further 
      studies of this variant with larger sample sizes and different ethnicities are 
      required for confirmation.

TI  - The molecular epidemiology of Huntington disease is related to intermediate 
      allele frequency and haplotype in the general population.
PG  - 346-357
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.b.32618 [doi]
AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is the most common monogenic neurodegenerative disorder 
      in populations of European ancestry, but occurs at lower prevalence in 
      populations of East Asian or black African descent. New mutations for HD result 
      from CAG repeat expansions of intermediate alleles (IAs), usually of paternal 
      origin. The differing prevalence of HD may be related to the rate of new 
      mutations in a population, but no comparative estimates of IA frequency or the HD 
      new mutation rate are available. In this study, we characterize IA frequency and 
      the CAG repeat distribution in fifteen populations of diverse ethnic origin. We 
      estimate the HD new mutation rate in a series of populations using molecular IA 
      expansion rates. The frequency of IAs was highest in Hispanic Americans and 
      Northern Europeans, and lowest in black Africans and East Asians. The prevalence 
      of HD correlated with the frequency of IAs by population and with the proportion 
      of IAs found on the HD-associated A1 haplotype. The HD new mutation rate was 
      estimated to be highest in populations with the highest frequency of IAs. In 
      European ancestry populations, one in 5,372 individuals from the general 
      population and 7.1% of individuals with an expanded CAG repeat in the HD range 
      are estimated to have a molecular new mutation. Our data suggest that the new 
      mutation rate for HD varies substantially between populations, and that IA 
      frequency and haplotype are closely linked to observed epidemiological 
      differences in the prevalence of HD across major ancestry groups in different 
      countries.

AB  - There is an unmet need of strategies for ex-vivo expansion of hematopoetic stem 
      cells (HSCs) without loss of their primitive nature or stemness. We evaluate here 
      a patent that attempts to address this need via key small molecules 1 and 40 that 
      possess a pyrimido[4,5-b]indole core. Areas covered: (i) Discussion on literature 
      reports of diverse strategies for ex-vivo expansion of stem cells. (ii) Synthetic 
      scheme to 1, and general synthetic schemes for compounds 1-55 reported in the 
      patent application. (iii) Analysis of the in vitro biological data for 1 and 40. 
      Highlight here is: 1 and 40 when used in combination with StemReginin1 (SR1), an 
      established aryl hydrocarbon receptor antagonist known for ex-vivo HSC expansion, 
      demonstrate better HSC expansion relative to SR1 alone. (iv) Analysis of the in 
      vivo biological data for 1 and 40. Expert opinion: Compelling evidence on the 
      molecular mechanism of action of 1 and 40 is not provided making it difficult to 
      optimize this series. It is suggested here that combining these molecules with 
      homing molecules will possibly improve overall engraftment time and hematopoietic 
      recovery. The numerous literature reports and biological data indicates that 
      these pyrimido[4,5-b]indole derivatives are promising candidates for the 
      development of potential therapies for hematopoietic ailments.

TI  - Expansion of cancer germline antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes for 
      immunotherapy.
PG  - 1010428317701309
LID - 10.1177/1010428317701309 [doi]
AB  - The cancer germline antigens MAGE-A1, MAGE-A3, and NY-ESO-1 can be used to target 
      relapsed or therapy-resistant malignant solid tumors, and previous studies have 
      demonstrated that these antigens can be epigenetically upregulated on the surface 
      of tumor cells following exposure to low-dose demethylating chemotherapy agents, 
      such as decitabine. The extent to which cancer germline antigen cytotoxic T 
      lymphocytes can be reliably expanded from healthy donors has not been well 
      characterized, specifically in terms of whether these T cells consistently kill 
      antigen-bearing targets or simply produce interferon-gamma in the presence of the 
      antigen. Cancer germline antigen cytotoxic T lymphocytes were generated using 
      conventional method and high-density lymphocyte culture method. We demonstrate 
      that there is no difference in the extent of antigen-specific killing with or 
      without CD25 depletion when interleukin-21 is added to the cultures. Cancer 
      germline antigen-specific killer cells could be expanded from 8/12 healthy donors 
      using overlapping peptide mixes derived from MAGE-A1, MAGE-A3, and NY-ESO-1 and 
      from 7/9 healthy donors using HLA-restricted epitopes. Furthermore, cytotoxic T 
      lymphocyte derived from 4/5 patients displayed specific cytotoxicity of target 
      cells expressing respective cancer germline antigen and HLA partially matched 
      tumor lines. High-density lymphocyte culture prior to stimulation with cancer 
      germline antigen peptides resulted in antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte 
      from healthy donors and patients from whom cancer germline antigen cytotoxic T 
      lymphocyte culture with conventional methods was not feasible. These data 
      demonstrate that MAGE-A1-, MAGE-A3-, and NY-ESO-1-specific T cells with 
      antigen-specific cytotoxicity can be cultured from healthy donors and 
      patient-derived cells making adoptive immunotherapy with these cytotoxic T 
      lymphocyte feasible.

TI  - Association of ankyrin repeats & kinase domain containing 1 (ANKK1) gene 
      polymorphism with co-morbid alcohol & nicotine dependence: A pilot study from a 
      tertiary care treatment centre in north India.
PG  - 33-38
LID - 10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_458_14 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: The frequently encountered co-morbidity of alcohol 
      dependence (AD) with nicotine dependence (ND) increases the risk for various 
      diseases. Ankyrin repeats and kinase domain containing 1 (ANKK1) gene 
      polymorphism is reported to be associated with both ND and AD. This study was 
      undertaken to investigate the possible association of alcohol and tobacco use 
      variables with ANKK1 polymorphism in co-morbid alcohol- and nicotine-dependent 
      treatment seekers visiting a tertiary care centre in north India. METHODS: 
      Seventy nine male participants (18-65 yr old) fulfilling diagnostic criteria for 
      ND and AD were included in the study. The socio-demographic data, along with 
      alcohol and tobacco use profile, was recorded and ANKK1 profiling was carried 
      out. Both the allele groups, A1 and A2, were compared with respect to demographic 
      and substance dependence profile. Univariate binary logistic regression analysis 
      was performed to determine the risk of high nicotine and alcohol consumption with 
      genotype. RESULTS: The A1 carrier group (n=33) reported a significantly higher 
      amount of alcohol and tobacco consumed per day. The scores on parameters of ND 
      were found to be significantly higher in this group. The logistic regression 
      analysis revealed that participants with A1 genotype were 2.5 times more likely 
      to report higher amount of alcohol and nicotine consumption than A2 carriers. 
      INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The study provides an indication for the 
      association of ANKK1 polymorphism in the form of higher substance consumption 
      among alcohol dependent smokers, who are A1 carriers and thus may require higher 
      attention of the treatment provider.

TI  - The adipokine tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5a in serum correlates to 
      adipose tissue expansion in obesity.
PG  - 764-774
LID - 10.1080/1354750X.2017.1334155 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) exists as two isoforms, 5a 
      and 5b. TRAP 5a is elevated in adipose tissue of obese women, interacts with 
      pre-adipocytes and is linked to insulin-sensitive hyperplastic obesity when 
      overexpressed in mice. The aim of this study was to investigate the relation 
      between serum TRAP 5a, adiposity indices and metabolic syndrome risk markers in 
      lean and obese women, using a newly developed TRAP 5a-specific ELISA. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: A TRAP 5a sandwich ELISA was optimized using TRAP 5a-specific 
      monoclonal antibodies and tested in sera of healthy males. TRAP 5a levels were 
      quantitated in sera from healthy males and lean and obese women. RESULTS: Serum 
      TRAP 5a protein levels were lower in obese women in comparison with lean. In 
      obese, but not in lean women, serum TRAP 5a correlated positively to % fat mass, 
      BMI, waist- and hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio and PAI, while no 
      correlations to serum leptin, HOMA, glucose, insulin, FFA, HDL, TG, APO-A1 and 
      APO-B were observed. CONCLUSIONS: TRAP 5a serum levels correlated positively to 
      anthropometric obesity parameters but not to metabolic syndrome risk factors, 
      indicating that serum TRAP 5a is associated with pathological adipose tissue 
      expansion.

TI  - Heterogeneous ribonuclear protein A3 (hnRNP A3) is present in dipeptide repeat 
      protein containing inclusions in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration and Motor

AB  - Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD) encompasses certain related 
      neurodegenerative disorders which alter behaviour, personality and language. 
      Heterogeneous ribonuclear proteins (hnRNPs) maintain RNA metabolism and changes 
      in their function may underpin the pathogenesis of FTLD. Immunostaining for hnRNP 
      A1, A2/B1 and A3 was performed on sections of temporal cortex with hippocampus 
      from 61 patients with FTLD, stratified by pathological hallmarks into FTLD-tau 
      and FTLD-TDP type A, B and C subtypes, and by genetics into patients with C9orf72 
      expansions, MAPT or GRN mutations, or those without known mutation. Four patients 
      with Motor Neurone Disease (MND) with C9orf72 expansions and 10 healthy controls 
      were also studied. Semi-quantitative analysis assessed hnRNP staining intensity 
      in dentate gyrus (DG) and CA4 region of hippocampus, and temporal cortex (Tcx) in 
      the different pathological and genetic groups.Immunostaining for hnRNP A1, A2/B1 
      and A3 revealed no consistent changes in pattern or amount of physiological 
      staining across any of the pathological or genetic groups. No immunostaining of 
      any inclusions resembling TDP-43 immunoreactive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions 
      or dystrophic neurites, was seen in either Tcx or DG of the hippocampus in any of 
      the FTLD cases investigated for hnRNP A1, A2/B1 and A3. However, immunostaining 
      for hnRNP A3 showed that inclusion bodies, resembling those TDP-43 negative, 
      p62-immunopositive structures containing dipeptide repeat proteins (DPR) were 
      variably observed in hippocampus and cerebellum. The proportion of cases showing 
      hnRNP A3-immunoreactive DPR, and the number of hnRNP A3-positive inclusions 
      within cases, was significantly greater in DG than in cells of CA4 region and 
      cerebellum, but the latter was significantly less in all three regions compared 
      to that detected by p62 immunostaining.

TI  - Association of 86 bp variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism of 
      interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL1RN) with susceptibility and clinical

AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic disease of unknown etiology. 
      Several studies have reported a variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) 86 bp 
      (rs2234663) in the intron 2 of IL1RN gene with RA risk. The present study was 
      designed to determine the frequencies of this polymorphism in patients with RA 
      and control subjects (CS) and its association with RA in a western Mexican 
      population. An analytical cross-sectional study was performed, in which 350 
      patients with RA and 307 CS were included. The identification of IL1RN VNTR 
      polymorphism was carried out by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and genotypes 
      were associated with clinical variables (DAS28 and CRP). The presence of A1/A2 
      genotype was associated with RA risk (p = 0.03, OR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.02-2.05). 
      Also, results indicate that the presence of heterozygote genotypes which include 
      A2 was associated with RA risk (p = 0.01, OR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.07-2.11). Patients 
      carrier of A2/A2 genotype have a higher score of DAS28 (5.64 [4.49-6.70]). A-/A- 
      has higher level of CRP (2.30 [0.62-9.10]) in comparison with A2/A- (1.06 
      [0.37-2.82]). A1/A2 genotype was associated with susceptibility to RA in a 
      western Mexican population. The presence of the A2/A2 genotype in RA is 
      associated with increased disease activity.

TI  - The targetable A1 Huntington disease haplotype has distinct Amerindian and 
      European origins in Latin America.
PG  - 332-340
LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2016.169 [doi]
AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is a dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG 
      repeat expansion in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene. HD occurs worldwide, but the 
      causative mutation is found on different HTT haplotypes in distinct ethnic 
      groups. In Latin America, HD is thought to have European origins, but indigenous 
      Amerindian ancestry has not been investigated. Here, we report dense HTT 
      haplotypes in 62 mestizo Peruvian HD families, 17 HD families from across Latin 
      America, and 42 controls of defined Peruvian Amerindian ethnicity to determine 
      the origin of HD in populations of admixed Amerindian and European descent. HD in 
      Peru occurs most frequently on the A1 HTT haplotype (73%), as in Europe, but on 
      an unexpected indigenous variant also found in Amerindian controls. This 
      Amerindian A1 HTT haplotype predominates over the European A1 variant among 
      geographically disparate Latin American controls and in HD families from across 
      Latin America, supporting an indigenous origin of the HD mutation in mestizo 
      American populations. We also show that a proportion of HD mutations in Peru 
      occur on a C1 HTT haplotype of putative Amerindian origin (14%). The majority of 
      HD mutations in Latin America may therefore occur on haplotypes of Amerindian 
      ancestry rather than on haplotypes resulting from European admixture. Despite the 
      distinct ethnic ancestry of Amerindian and European A1 HTT, alleles on the parent 
      A1 HTT haplotype allow for development of identical antisense molecules to 
      selectively silence the HD mutation in the greatest proportion of patients in 
      both Latin American and European populations.

TI  - A triazole derivative elicits autophagic clearance of polyglutamine aggregation 
      in neuronal cells.
PG  - 2947-2957
AB  - Trinucleotide CAG repeat expansion in the coding region of genes has a propensity 
      to form polyglutamine (polyQ) aggregates that contribute to neuronal disorders. 
      Strategies in elevating autophagy to disintegrate the insoluble aggregates 
      without injuring cells have become a major goal for therapy. In this work, a 
      triazole derivative, OC-13, was found accelerating autophagic clearance of polyQ 
      aggregation in human neuroblastoma cells following induction of the enhanced 
      green fluorescence-conjugated chimeric protein that enclosed 79 polyQ repeats 
      (Q79-EGFP). OC-13 accelerated autophagy development and removed nuclear Q79-EGFP 
      aggregates. The increase of Beclin-1, turnover of LC3-I to LC3-II and degradation 
      of p62 supported autophagy activation. Pretreatment of autophagy inhibitor, 
      bafilomycin A1, not only suppressed autophagolysome fusion, but also impeded 
      aggregate eradication. The study also showed that c-Jun N-terminal 
      kinase/Beclin-1 pathway was activated during OC-13 treatment and c-Jun N-terminal 
      kinase inhibitor impaired autophagy and final breakdown. Autophagic clearance of 
      the insoluble aggregates demonstrated the feasibility of OC-13 in alleviating 
      neuronal disorders because of expanded glutamine stretches.

TI  - A novel association between IL1-Ra (receptor antagonist) gene polymorphism and 
      T1DM in Al-Madina Al-Mounawra.
PG  - 3701-8
LID - 9606 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL1-Ra) is initiated to 
      terminate the acute pro-inflammatory event and prevent chronic inflammation from 
      damaging healthy cells. We aim to draw the attention of IL1-Ra (VNTR) gene 
      polymorphism and determine whether IL1-Ra confer susceptibility to type 1 
      diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and evaluate the genotype and allele distribution of 
      IL1-Ra gene in a Saudi population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Case control study 
      included (100) T1DM Saudi children, plus 102 healthy unrelated individuals as 
      control group. They were evaluated for variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) of 
      IL1-Ra gene polymorphism. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of VNTR of 86bp 
      in intron 2 of IL1-Ra was performed. RESULTS: A1A1 and A1A2 genotypes with 
      alleles A1 and A2 frequency were the most common both in cases and controls 
      (healthy population); prevalence (28%, 56% & 57.8%, 39.2% respectively) and (58%, 
      38% and 77.5%, 22.5% respectively). In addition IL1-Ra gene polymorphism had 
      higher risk significantly different between diabetic children and controls. 
      (A1/A2) genotype had higher frequency statistically significant in DM patients 
      than controls [56% vs. 39.2%, p < 0.02] and had twice time risk [OR = 1.97, 95% 
      CI = 1.1-3.4, p < 0.02]. With further stratification, there was strong 
      association between diabetic patients carriage IL1-Ra (A2) allele and controls 
      [38% vs. 22.5%, p = 0.001] which had higher risk [OR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.4-3.2, p 
      = 0.001] for susceptibility of diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes a 
      positive association between IL1-Ra (VNTR) polymorphism and DM among Saudi 
      children. This may suggest that (A2) allele may play important role in disease 
      susceptibility.

TI  - Huntingtin Haplotypes Provide Prioritized Target Panels for Allele-specific 
      Silencing in Huntington Disease Patients of European Ancestry.

AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is a dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG 
      repeat expansion in the Huntingtin gene (HTT). Heterozygous polymorphisms in cis 
      with the mutation allow for allele-specific suppression of the pathogenic HTT 
      transcript as a therapeutic strategy. To prioritize target selection, precise 
      heterozygosity estimates are needed across diverse HD patient populations. Here 
      we present the first comprehensive investigation of all common target alleles 
      across the HTT gene, using 738 reference haplotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project 
      and 2364 haplotypes from HD patients and relatives in Canada, Sweden, France, and 
      Italy. The most common HD haplotypes (A1, A2, and A3a) define mutually exclusive 
      sets of polymorphisms for allele-specific therapy in the greatest number of 
      patients. Across all four populations, a maximum of 80% are treatable using these 
      three target haplotypes. We identify a novel deletion found exclusively on the A1 
      haplotype, enabling potent and selective silencing of mutant HTT in approximately 
      40% of the patients. Antisense oligonucleotides complementary to the deletion 
      reduce mutant A1 HTT mRNA by 78% in patient cells while sparing wild-type HTT 
      expression. By suppressing specific haplotypes on which expanded CAG occurs, we 
      demonstrate a rational approach to the development of allele-specific therapy for 
      a monogenic disorder.

TI  - Antisense RNA foci in the motor neurons of C9ORF72-ALS patients are associated 
      with TDP-43 proteinopathy.
PG  - 63-75
LID - 10.1007/s00401-015-1429-9 [doi]
AB  - GGGGCC repeat expansions of C9ORF72 represent the most common genetic variant of 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia. We and others 
      have proposed that RNA transcribed from the repeat sequence is toxic via 
      sequestration of RNA-binding factors. Both GGGGCC-repeat (sense) and 
      CCCCGG-repeat (antisense) molecules are detectable by fluorescence in situ 
      hybridisation as RNA foci, but their relative expression pattern within the CNS 
      and contribution to disease has not been determined. Blinded examination of CNS 
      biosamples from ALS patients with a repeat expansion of C9ORF72 showed that 
      antisense foci are present at a significantly higher frequency in cerebellar 
      Purkinje neurons and motor neurons, whereas sense foci are present at a 
      significantly higher frequency in cerebellar granule neurons. Consistent with 
      this, inclusions containing sense or antisense derived dipeptide repeat proteins 
      were present at significantly higher frequency in cerebellar granule neurons or 
      motor neurons, respectively. Immunohistochemistry and UV-crosslinking studies 
      showed that sense and antisense RNA molecules share similar interactions with 
      SRSF2, hnRNP K, hnRNP A1, ALYREF, and hnRNP H/F. Together these data suggest 
      that, although sense and antisense RNA molecules might be expected to be equally 
      toxic via their shared protein binding partners, distinct patterns of expression 
      in various CNS neuronal populations could lead to relative differences in their 
      contribution to the pathogenesis of neuronal injury. Moreover in motor neurons, 
      which are the primary target of pathology in ALS, the presence of antisense foci 
      (chi (2), p < 0.00001) but not sense foci (chi (2), p = 0.75) correlated with 
      mislocalisation of TDP-43, which is the hallmark of ALS neurodegeneration. This 
      has implications for translational approaches to C9ORF72 disease, and furthermore 
      interacting RNA-processing factors and transcriptional activators responsible for 
      antisense versus sense transcription might represent novel therapeutic targets.

TI  - A rapid expansion of HIV-1 CRF63_02A1 among newly diagnosed HIV-infected 
      individuals in the Tomsk Region, Russia.
PG  - 456-60
LID - 10.1089/AID.2014.0375 [doi]
AB  - The prevalence of HIV infection in different Russian regions is nonuniform. In 
      the Tomsk region (TR), 2020 HIV new infection cases were recorded in 2013, the 
      morbidity having increased 5.9-fold as compared to 2012. In total, 64 blood 
      plasma samples from primary HIV cases have been examined. HIV-specific fragments 
      of the pol gene have been obtained for 61 samples (of protease for 58 and of 
      integrase for 23) and of the env gene V3 region for 40 samples. Phylogenetic 
      analysis of the determined HIV-1 sequences has detected CRF63_02A1 in 55 (90.2%) 
      cases, whereas HIV subtype A1, characteristic of Russia, has been observed in 
      only three (4.9%) patients. Three (4.9%) cases contain CRF63_02A1/A recombinant 
      variants. This article demonstrates that a drastic activation of the epidemic in 
      the Tomsk region is accompanied by a rapid spreading of the recently described 
      HIV-1 CRF63_02A1, which we detected in the Novosibirsk region outbreak of 2008.

      coronary artery disease (CAD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Multifactor 
      dimensionality reduction analysis was carried out on four case-control datasets. 
      Cross-talk was observed between one-carbon and xenobiotic pathways in breast 
      cancer (RFC 80 G>A, COMT H108L and TYMS 5'-UTR 28 bp tandem repeat) and SLE 
      (CYP1A1 m1, MTRR 66 A>G and GSTT1). Gene-gene interactions within one-carbon 
      metabolic pathway were observed in CAD (GCPII 1561 C>T, SHMT 1420 C>T and MTHFR 
      677 C>T) and PD (cSHMT 1420 C>T, MTRR 66 A>G and RFC1 80 G>A). These interaction 
      models showed good predictability of risk for PD (The area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic curve (C) = 0.83) and SLE (C = 0.73); and moderate 
      predictability of risk for breast cancer (C = 0.64) and CAD (C = 0.63). 
      Cross-talk between one-carbon and xenobiotic pathways was observed in diseases 
      with female preponderance. Gene-gene interactions within one-carbon metabolic 
      pathway were observed in diseases with male preponderance.

TI  - Genetic polymorphisms in candidate genes predict increased toxicity with 
      methotrexate therapy in Lebanese children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
PG  - 387-96
LID - 10.1097/FPC.0000000000000069 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to analyze polymorphisms in genes involved 
      in 6-mercaptopurine detoxification (TPMT); methotrexate (MTX) metabolism 
      including ABCB1 (or MDR1), ABCC2, SLC19A1 (or RFC1), and SLCO1B1; and the MTX 
      effect mainly MTHFR and TYMS, and to assess whether these polymorphisms are 
      predictors of treatment toxicity and/or MTX clearance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      This study included 127 Lebanese acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients, of whom 
      117 were treated following the St Jude's Children Research Hospital protocol. 
      Genotyping was performed using real-time PCR or restriction fragment length 
      polymorphism. MTX levels were measured using a polarization fluorescence assay 
      from Roche. MTX clearance was estimated on the basis of all available MTX levels 
      measured after high-dose MTX treatment during the consolidation phase. RESULTS: 
      Five variants in four genes (MTHFR, ABCB1, ABCC2, and TYMS) were shown to be 
      associated with toxicity, but neither was associated with MTX pharmacokinetic 
      parameters. For instance, during the consolidation phase, a statistically 
      significant association was found between MTHFR rs1801133 variant allele carriers 
      and a decrease in hemoglobin levels [odds ratio (OR)=3.057; 95% confidence 
      interval (CI): 1.217; 7.680]. In addition, a statistically significant 
      association was found among neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count<500) and 
      variant allele carriers of ABCB1 rs1045642 (OR=5.174; 95% CI: 1.674; 15.989) and 
      ABCB1 rs1128503 (OR=3.364; 95% CI: 1.257; 9.004), respectively. ABCC2 rs717620 
      variant allele carriers needed significantly more time to reach a MTX level below 
      0.1 micromol/l (beta=5.122; 95% CI: 1.412; 8.831). During the continuation phase, a 
      statistically significant association was found between ABCC2 rs717620 and TYMS 
      28-bp tandem repeats carriers with the need to decrease weekly MTX doses 
      (beta=-4.905; 95% CI: -9; -0.809 and beta=-5.770; 95% CI: -10.138; -1.403), 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: Genotyping for MTHFR, ABCB1, ABCC2, and TYMS 
      polymorphisms may be useful in identifying patients at risk of increased MTX 
      toxicity and the need for dose optimization before treatment initiation.

TI  - Sequestration of multiple RNA recognition motif-containing proteins by C9orf72 
      repeat expansions.
PG  - 2040-51
LID - 10.1093/brain/awu120 [doi]
AB  - GGGGCC repeat expansions of C9orf72 represent the most common genetic variant of 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal degeneration, but the mechanism 
      of pathogenesis is unclear. Recent reports have suggested that the transcribed 
      repeat might form toxic RNA foci that sequester various RNA processing proteins. 
      Consensus as to the identity of the binding partners is missing and whole 
      neuronal proteome investigation is needed. Using RNA fluorescence in situ 
      hybridization we first identified nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA foci in peripheral 
      and central nervous system biosamples from patients with amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis with a repeat expansion of C9orf72 (C9orf72+), but not from those 
      patients without a repeat expansion of C9orf72 (C9orf72-) or control subjects. 
      Moreover, in the cases examined, the distribution of foci-positive neurons 
      correlated with the clinical phenotype (t-test P < 0.05). As expected, RNA foci 
      are ablated by RNase treatment. Interestingly, we identified foci in fibroblasts 
      from an asymptomatic C9orf72+ carrier. We next performed pulldown assays, with 
      GGGGCC5, in conjunction with mass spectrometry analysis, to identify candidate 
      binding partners of the GGGGCC repeat expansion. Proteins containing RNA 
      recognition motifs and involved in splicing, messenger RNA nuclear export and/or 
      translation were significantly enriched. Immunohistochemistry in central nervous 
      system tissue from C9orf72+ patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
      demonstrated co-localization of RNA foci with SRSF2, hnRNP H1/F, ALYREF and hnRNP 
      A1 in cerebellar granule cells and with SRSF2, hnRNP H1/F and ALYREF in motor 
      neurons, the primary target of pathology in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Direct 
      binding of proteins to GGGGCC repeat RNA was confirmed in vitro by 
      ultraviolet-crosslinking assays. Co-localization was only detected in a small 
      proportion of RNA foci, suggesting dynamic sequestration rather than irreversible 
      binding. Additional immunohistochemistry demonstrated that neurons with and 
      without RNA foci were equally likely to show nuclear depletion of TDP-43 (chi(2) P 
      = 0.75) or poly-GA dipeptide repeat protein inclusions (chi(2) P = 0.46). Our 
      findings suggest two non-exclusive pathogenic mechanisms: (i) functional 
      depletion of RNA-processing proteins resulting in disruption of messenger RNA 
      splicing; and (ii) licensing of expanded C9orf72 pre-messenger RNA for nuclear 
      export by inappropriate association with messenger RNA export adaptor protein(s) 
      leading to cytoplasmic repeat associated non-ATG translation and formation of 
      potentially toxic dipeptide repeat protein.

AB  - This study from South India was performed to ascertain the impact of seven 
      functional polymorphisms of one-carbon metabolic pathway on total plasma 
      homocysteine levels and susceptibility to PD. A total of 151 cases of Parkinson's 
      disease and 416 healthy controls were analyzed for fasting plasma homocysteine 
      levels by reverse phase HPLC. PCR-RFLP approaches were used to analyze glutamate 
      carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) 1561 C>T, reduced folate carrier 1 (RFC1) 80 G>A, 
      cytosolic serine hydroxymethyl transferase (cSHMT) 1420 C>T, methylene 
      tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677 C>T, methionine synthase (MTR) 2756 A>G 
      and methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) 66 A>G polymorphisms. PCR-AFLP was used 
      for the analysis of thymidylate synthase (TYMS) 5'-UTR 28bp tandem repeat. PD 
      cases exhibited elevated plasma homocysteine levels compared to controls (men: 
      28.8 +/- 6.9 vs. 16.4 +/- 8.8 mumol/L; women: 25.4 +/- 5.3 vs. 11.2 +/- 5.1mumol/L). 
      Homocysteine levels showed positive correlation with male gender (r=0.39, 
      p<0.0001) and MTRR 66 A>G (r=0.31, p<0.0001) whereas an inverse correlation was 
      observed with cSHMT 1420 C>T polymorphism. MTRR 66 A>G polymorphism showed 
      independent risk for PD (OR: 3.42, 95% CI: 2.35-4.98) whereas cSHMT 1420 C>T 
      conferred protection against PD (OR: 0.11, 95% CI: 0.07-0.17). Multifactor 
      dimensionality reduction analysis showed synergistic interactions between MTHFR 
      677 C>T and MTRR 66 A>G, whereas cSHMT 1420 C>T exhibited counteracting 
      interactions in altering susceptibility to PD. To conclude, PD cases exhibited 
      hyperhomocysteinemia and MTRR 66 A>G and cSHMT 1420 C>T gene variants were shown 
      to modulate PD risk by altering the homocysteine levels.

AB  - PURPOSE: To study cerebral adenosine receptors (AR) in premanifest and manifest 
      stages of Huntington's disease (HD). METHODS: We quantified the cerebral binding 
      potential (BP ND) of the A(1)AR in carriers of the HD CAG trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion using the radioligand [(18) F]CPFPX and PET. Four groups were 
      investigated: (i) premanifest individuals far (preHD-A; n = 7) or (ii) near 
      (preHD-B; n = 6) to the predicted symptom onset, (iii) manifest HD patients 
      (n = 8), and (iv) controls (n = 36). RESULTS: Cerebral A(1)AR values of preHD-A 
      subjects were generally higher than those of controls (by up to 31%, p < .01, in 
      the thalamus on average). Across stages a successive reduction of A(1)AR BPND was 
      observed to the levels of controls in preHD-B and undercutting controls in 
      manifest HD by down to 25%, p < .01, in the caudatus and amygdala. There was a 
      strong correlation between A(1)AR BP ND and years to onset. Before onset of HD, the 
      assumed annual rates of change of A(1)AR density were -1.2% in the caudatus, -1.7% 
      in the thalamus and -3.4% in the amygdala, while the corresponding volume losses 
      amounted to 0.6%, 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Adenosine receptors 
      switch from supra to subnormal levels during phenoconversion of HD. This 
      differential regulation may play a role in the pathophysiology of altered energy 
      metabolism.

TI  - CAG-Expansion Haplotype Analysis in a Population with a Low Prevalence of 
      Huntington's Disease.
PG  - 32-6
LID - 10.3988/jcn.2014.10.1.32 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The prevalence of Huntington's disease (HD) among East 
      Asians is less than one-tenth of that among Caucasians. Such a low prevalence may 
      be attributable to a lack of carriers of specific predisposing haplogroups 
      associated with the high instability of the Huntingtin gene (HTT). The aim of 
      this study was to evaluate the association between specific HTT haplogroups and 
      the occurrence of HD in a Thai population. METHODS: CAG-repeat sizes and HTT 
      haplotypes were analyzed in 18 Thai HD patients and 215 control subjects. 
      Twenty-two tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) were genotyped. 
      RESULTS: Only 18 patients from 15 unrelated families were identified over the 
      last 17 years. Pathological CAG-repeat alleles ranged from 39 to 48 repeats 
      (43.5+/-3.0, mean+/-SD), and normal alleles ranged from 9 to 24 repeats (16.49+/-1.74). 
      Only two of the chromosomes studied comprised intermediate alleles. Unlike the 
      Caucasian data, all but 1 of the 22 tSNPs were not associated with the occurrence 
      of HD. The predisposing haplogroups for Caucasian HD (haplogroups A1 and A2) are 
      very rare in Thai patients (<4%). Both HD and normal chromosomes are commonly 
      haplogroups A5 and C, in contrast to the case for Chinese and Japanese patients, 
      in whom only haplogroup C was common in HD chromosomes. The frequency of 
      CAG-repeat sizes of haplogroup A5 and C were also similarly distributed. 
      CONCLUSIONS: HD chromosomes of Thai patients may arise randomly from each 
      haplogroup, with a similar mutation rate. This rate is much lower than the CAG 
      expansions from Caucasian HD haplogroups. These data suggest that the different 
      mechanisms underlie CAG expansion in Thai and Caucasian patients.

      haplotype.

AB  - Huntington disease (HD, OMIM #143100) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      disorder due to a CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene, encoding a polyglutamine 
      tract in the N-terminal part of the huntingtin protein. Most cases are inherited 
      from an affected parent, but in about 10% of cases the condition appears to be de 
      novo.(1) De novo or sporadic cases are usually due to CAG repeat expansion of 
      intermediate alleles. Intermediate alleles have 27-35 CAG repeats, and the higher 
      the number of repeats, the higher the risk for expansion into disease range, 
      usually upon paternal transmission.(2) In most cases, the change in repeat size 
      is minor, and gradual increases into the disease range over several generations 
      is the basis of new genetic mutations and stable disease prevalence. So far, the 
      largest single-step expansions reported were from 27 to 38(3) and from 35 to 
      58(2) CAG repeats. It has recently been shown that intermediate alleles and 
      disease alleles share the same haplotypes, which is expected if intermediate 
      alleles are the main source of new mutation cases. The high-risk haplotypes are 
      called A1 and A2, and are both prevalent among Caucasians but rare in other 
      ethnic groups.(4)

AB  - Inflammation is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of rheumatic heart 
      disease (RHD), a disorder of heart valves caused by a combination of immune, 
      genetic and environmental factors. Cytokines are important mediators of 
      inflammatory and immune responses. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
      role of cytokine gene polymorphisms and their potential usefulness as biomarkers 
      in RHD patients from Pakistan. We screened 150 RHD patients and 204 ethnically 
      matched controls for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha(-308)G/A, interleukin 
      (IL)-10(-1082) G/A, interleukin (IL)-6(-174) G/C and a variable number of tandem 
      repeats (VNTRs) polymorphism of the IL-1Ra gene using polymerase chain reaction. 
      The results showed that TNF-alpha(-308) A and IL-6(-174) G alleles were associated 
      with susceptibility to RHD (p=0.000; OR=2.81; CI=1.5-5.14 and p=0.025; OR=1.50; 
      CI=1.04-2.16 respectively). The TNF-alpha(-308) AA and GA genotypes were associated 
      with susceptibility to RHD (p=0.012; OR=9.94; CI; 1.21-217.3 and p=0.046; 
      OR=1.97; CI=0.98-3.97 respectively) while the GG genotype seemed to confer 
      resistance (p=0.003; OR=0.39; CI=0.20-0.76). The GG genotype for IL-6(-174) was 
      significantly associated with predisposition to RHD (p=0.015; OR=2.6; 
      CI=1.17-5.85). The A1 (four repeats) and A2 (two repeats) alleles at the IL-1Ra 
      VNTR polymorphism were associated with resistance and susceptibility to RHD 
      respectively. However, this polymorphism deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium 
      in both patients and controls in our population. TNF-alpha(-308) and IL-6(-174) 
      polymorphisms may be useful markers for the identification of individuals 
      susceptible to RHD in Pakistan. These individuals could be provided aggressive 
      prophylactic intervention to prevent the morbidity and mortality associated with 
      RHD.

AB  - Lipoxygenases have been implicated in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease 
      (CAD) for its potent proinflammatory role. The Sp1 addition/deletion polymorphism 
      in promoter region of the 5-lipoxygenase gene (ALOX5) has been associated with 
      increased risk of carotid atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. To determine 
      the role of this polymorphism in our population we performed a 
      case-control-genetic association study on 117 healthy controls and 119 
      angiographically verified CAD patients. Biochemical analysis was performed using 
      standard automated assays. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and LDL-C 
      subfraction levels were estimated using precipitation methods. Genotyping of 
      polymorphism in the ALOX5 (Sp1 variants) was done using PCR-based heteroduplex 
      analysis and automated sequencing. The Sp1 promoter repeat variants were found to 
      be associated with CAD (p < 0.0001, OR = 4.47, 95% confidence interval = 
      2.58-7.74). Furthermore, the 5/5 genotype of the ALOX5 polymorphism in the 
      healthy subjects was found to be associated with elevated HDL-C (p= 0.004), 
      HDL(3) -C (p= 0.04), apo A1 (p= 0.011) and sdLDL (p= 0.001). We conclude that 
      this polymorphism influences LDL and HDL subfraction levels and is a risk factor 
      for CAD in our population. Clin Trans Sci 2012; Volume 5: 408-411.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have hypothesized that genes involved in the dopamine 
      system, including dopamine type-2 receptor (DRD2)-related TaqIA polymorphism and 
      monoamine oxidase-A upstream variable number tandem repeat (uVNTR), may be 
      associated with alcoholism. But their results were contradictory because of 
      alcoholism's heterogeneity. Therefore, we examined whether the DRD2TaqIA and 
      MAOA-uVNTR gene polymorphisms are susceptibility factors for alcoholism comorbid 
      with bipolar disorder (ALC+BP) in Han Chinese in Taiwan. METHODS: We recruited 
      101 Han Chinese men with comorbid alcoholism and bipolar disorder, and 328 
      healthy male controls from the community. Genotyping was done using PCR-RFLP. 
      RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the genotypic frequencies of 
      the DRD2TaqIA or the MAOA-uVNTR polymorphisms between the 2 groups. The 
      MAOA-uVNTR 3-repeat had a significant protective effect on the ALC+BP (odds 
      ratio=0.432, p=0.035) but not on the healthy controls. However, the interaction 
      between the MAOA-uVNTR 3-repeat and DRD2 A1/A2 was a risk factor in the ALC+BP 
      (odds ratio=3.451, p=0.018). CONCLUSIONS: We indicated the impact of the 
      association between MAOA-uVNTR 3-repeat and DRD2 A1/A2 with ALC+BP.

AB  - Anthrax is a serious disease caused by Bacillus anthracis. Humans can become 
      infected by handling products from infected animals, by breathing spores and 
      rarely by eating undercooked meat from infected animals. The genome of B. 
      anthracis is highly monomorphic and thus shows very low DNA sequence variation. 
      We analysed the molecular characteristics of 12 B. anthracis isolates from 
      outbreaks in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, which have occurred during the 
      past 10 years along with two vaccine strains. Genotyping system based on 
      variable-number tandem repeat analysis at six loci revealed that six isolates 
      belong to genotype from the A1.a cluster whilst six isolates relate to the B2 
      cluster, compared to 89 previously described genotypes. The distribution of two 
      evolutionarily distant clusters suggests an introduction of B. anthracis to this 
      area in at least two separate events.

TI  - Cytochrome P450 2E1 variable number tandem repeat polymorphisms and health risks: 
      a genotype-phenotype study in cancers associated with drinking and/or smoking.
PG  - 416-20
LID - 10.3892/mmr.2012.914 [doi]
AB  - Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) is one of the main enzymes involved in the oxidation 
      of ethanol and in the transformation of a number of potentially dangerous 
      compounds. It has various polymorphic sites, one of which is a variable number 
      tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism previously described in the 5'-flanking region. 
      The aim of this study was to investigate the genotype-phenotype association 
      between CYP2E1 VNTR polymorphisms and risky health habits in healthy subjects and 
      to analyze the associations between these polymorphisms with drinking- and/or 
      smoking-related cancers. We analyzed 166 healthy subjects by genotyping for the 
      CYP2E1 VNTR polymorphism associated with drinking and/or smoking habits by the 
      more sensitive restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction 
      (RFLP-PCR) method, using the NlaIV restriction enzyme. Sixty cases of pancreatic 
      adenocarcinoma (PA) and 66 with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), were also 
      genotyped. Statistical analysis was carried out to investigate the 
      genotype-phenotype associations and to compare certain genotypes and cancer. We 
      found 7 genotypes both in the healthy subjects and patients. The A1/A1 genotype 
      was observed to be mainly associated with non-drinkers and -smokers (87.5 and 
      75.0%, respectively); moreover it was never found in the PA or HCC patients. 
      Conversely, a weak association between A2/A3 with smokers (45.8%) and A4/A4 with 
      drinkers (53.9%) was detected. In addition, the A4/A4 genotype was found to be 
      significantly associated to PA [odds ratio (OR)=3.25; 95% confidence interval 
      (CI) 1.21-7.50]. Our data demonstrate that certain CYP2E1 VNTR genotypes are 
      associated with drinking and/or smoking habits; consequently, they may contribute 
      either to the decreased or increased risk of developing drinking- and/or 
      smoking-related cancers. In particular, we hypothesize that the A1/A1 VNTR 
      genotype may have a protective role against drinking- and/or smoking-related 
      cancers, and that A4/A4 may be a high-risk genotype during the early stages of 
      cancer.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB)-associated 
      pneumonia has been a common disease and a therapeutic problem in hospitals. 
      Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) has been considered a required role 
      for host immune defense in pneumonia disease. The aim of this study was to 
      investigate whether the variable nucleotide tandem repeat polymorphism of the 
      IL-1ra gene was associated with MDRAB-related pneumonia. METHODS: Sixty-six 
      pneumonia patients were enrolled in the study: 36 subjects had MDRAB-related 
      pneumonia and 30 controls had non-MDRAB pneumonia. Polymerase chain reaction, 
      restriction fragment length polymorphism, and agarose gel electrophoresis 
      techniques were used to determine the IL-1ra genotype. RESULTS: The frequencies 
      of the IL-1ra genotype in the MDRAB-related pneumonia cases were A1/A1, 0.889 and 
      A1/A2, 0.111; the frequencies of the IL-1ra genotype in the controls were A1/A1, 
      0.333 and A1/A2, 0.667. A statistically significant difference was determined (P 
      < 0.05). We also observed an increase in the frequency of IL-1ra A1 allele in the 
      MDRAB-related pneumonia group. A statistically significant difference was 
      determined (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We suggested that IL-1ra polymorphism was 
      associated with the risk of MDRAB-related pneumonia.

TI  - Association of aberrations in one-carbon metabolism with molecular phenotype and 
      grade of breast cancer.
PG  - E32-41
LID - 10.1002/mc.21830 [doi]
AB  - We have earlier demonstrated the role of aberrant one-carbon metabolism in the 
      etiology of breast cancer. In the current study, we examine the clinical utility 
      of these factors in predicting the subtype of breast cancer and as indicators of 
      disease progression. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length 
      polymorphism (RFLP) and PCR-amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) 
      approaches were used for genetic analysis. Plasma folate and homocysteine were 
      measured using Axsym folate kit and reverse phase HPLC, respectively. Multiple 
      linear regression models were used to test the predictability of disease 
      progression. Luminal A subtype was associated with late age of onset, higher body 
      mass index and lack of family history of breast cancer. Thymidylate synthase 
      (TYMS) 5'-UTR 28 bp tandem repeat (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.05-4.16) and methylene 
      tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T (OR: 4.10, 95% CI: 1.40-11.95) were 
      strongly associated with Luminal B. Reduced folate carrier (RFC1) G80A (OR: 2.92, 
      95% CI: 1.22-6.97) and methionine synthase (MTR) A2756G (OR: 4.71, 95% CI: 
      1.66-13.31) polymorphisms were associated with LuminA-HH subtype while MTHFR 
      C677T showed association with HER-enriched (OR: 30.41, 95% CI: 6.47-142.91). 
      Cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase (cSHMT) conferred protection against 
      basal-like breast cancer (OR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.22-0.98). HER-enriched and 
      basal-like subtypes showed positive association with familial breast cancer and 
      inverse association with plasma folate. Hyperhomocysteinemia was observed in 
      Luminal B and basal-like subtypes. Multiple linear regression models of aberrant 
      one-carbon metabolism were found to be moderate predictors of breast cancer grade 
      (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, C = 0.72, 95% CI: 
      0.58-0.87, P = 0.008). To conclude, aberrations in one-carbon metabolism predict 
      the subtype of breast cancer and disease progression.

TI  - Genomic plasticity of the MHC class I A region in rhesus macaques: extensive 
      haplotype diversity at the population level as revealed by microsatellites.
PG  - 73-83
LID - 10.1007/s00251-010-0486-4 [doi]
AB  - The Mamu-A genes of the rhesus macaque show different degrees of polymorphism, 
      transcription level variation, and differential haplotype distribution. Per 
      haplotype, usually one "major" transcribed gene is present, A1 (A7), in various 
      combinations with "minor" genes, A2 to A6. In silico analysis of the physical map 
      of a heterozygous animal revealed the presence of similar Mamu-A regions 
      consisting of four duplication units, but with dissimilar positions of the A1 
      genes on both haplotypes, and in combination with different minor genes. Two 
      microsatellites, D6S2854 and D6S2859, have been selected as potential tools to 
      characterize this complex region. Subsequent analysis of a large breeding colony 
      resulted in the description of highly discriminative patterns, displaying copy 
      number variation in concert with microsatellite repeat length differences. 
      Sequencing and segregation analyses revealed that these patterns are unique for 
      each Mamu-A haplotype. In animals of Indian, Burmese, and Chinese origin, 19, 15, 
      or 9 haplotypes, respectively, could be defined, illustrating the occurrence of 
      differential block duplications and subsequent rearrangements by recombination. 
      The haplotypes can be assigned to 12 unique combinations of genes (region 
      configurations). Although most configurations harbor two transcribed A genes, one 
      or three genes per haplotype are also present. Additionally, haplotypes lacking 
      an A1 gene or with an A1 duplication appear to exist. The presence of different 
      transcribed A genes/alleles in monkeys from various origins may have an impact on 
      differential disease susceptibilities. The high-throughput microsatellite 
      technique will be a valuable tool in animal selection for diverse biomedical 
      research projects.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A case-control study. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship 
      between gene polymorphism in interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL1RN) and 
      response to conservative treatment of lumbar herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP). 
      SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There had been several studies on IL1RN polymorphism 
      related with incidence of disc degeneration or back pain but, there had been no 
      report on clinical features of lumbar HNP. METHODS: We analyzed the variable 
      number tandem repeat polymorphism of IL1RN genes in 54 single level 
      subligamentous extruded lumbar HNP patients and compared allele frequency and 
      incidence of heterozygote with 227 healthy adult controls. Within HNP group, we 
      compared 2 groups; surgery group and conservative treatment group according to 
      response to conservative treatment. RESULTS: The prevalence of A1 (odd ratio = 
      0.45, P = 0.0009) and A3 (odd ratio = 3.86, P = 0.0006) was significantly higher 
      in HNP group than control group. The allele frequency of A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5 
      were 84.2:84.6, 7.3:15.4, 8.5:0, 0:0, 0:0, respectively, in surgical and 
      conservative treatment group. The allele frequency for A3 was found significantly 
      higher in the surgery group than in the conservative treatment group. CONCLUSION: 
      These results suggest that a high allele prevalence of A3 contribute to the 
      clinical progression and the response to conservative treatment for lumbar HNP. 
      IL1RN gene polymorphism may affect the clinical course of lumbar HNP.

TI  - Large direct repeats flank genomic rearrangements between a new clinical isolate 
      of Francisella tularensis subsp. tularensis A1 and Schu S4.
PG  - e9007

AB  - Francisella tularensis subspecies tularensis consists of two separate populations 
      A1 and A2. This report describes the complete genome sequence of NE061598, an F. 
      tularensis subspecies tularensis A1 isolated in 1998 from a human with clinical 
      disease in Nebraska, United States of America. The genome sequence was compared 
      to Schu S4, an F. tularensis subspecies tularensis A1a strain originally isolated 
      in Ohio in 1941. It was determined that there were 25 nucleotide polymorphisms 
      (22 SNPs and 3 indels) between Schu S4 and NE061598; two of these polymorphisms 
      were in potential virulence loci. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis 
      demonstrated that NE061598 was an A1a genotype. Other differences included repeat 
      sequences (n = 11 separate loci), four of which were contained in coding 
      sequences, and an inversion and rearrangement probably mediated by insertion 
      sequences and the previously identified direct repeats I, II, and III. Five new 
      variable-number tandem repeats were identified; three of these five were unique 
      in NE061598 compared to Schu S4. Importantly, there was no gene loss or gain 
      identified between NE061598 and Schu S4. Interpretation of these data suggests 
      there is significant sequence conservation and chromosomal synteny within the A1 
      population. Further studies are needed to determine the biological properties 
      driving the selective pressure that maintains the chromosomal structure of this 
      monomorphic pathogen.

TI  - Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist gene (IL1RN) polymorphism possibly associated 
      to severity of rheumatic carditis in a Brazilian cohort.
PG  - 109-13
LID - 10.1016/j.cyto.2009.09.003 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the IL1RN polymorphism as a possible marker for Rheumatic Fever 
      (RF) susceptibility or disease severity. METHODS: The genotypes of 84 RF patients 
      (Jones criteria) and 84 normal race-matched controls were determined through the 
      analysis of the number of 86-bp tandem repeats in the second intron of IL1RN. The 
      DNA was extracted from peripheral-blood leukocytes and amplified with specific 
      primers. Clinical manifestations of RF were obtained through a standardized 
      questionnaire and an extensive chart review. Carditis was defined as new onset 
      cardiac murmur that was perceived by a trained physician with corresponding 
      valvae regurgitation or stenosis on echocardiogram. Carditis was classified as 
      severe in the presence of congestive heart failure or upon the indication for 
      cardiac surgery. The statistical association among the genotypes, RF and its 
      clinical variations was determined. RESULTS: The presence of allele 1 and the 
      genotype A1/A1 were found less frequently among patients with severe carditis 
      when compared to patients without this manifestation (OR=0.11, p=0.031; OR=0.092, 
      p=0.017). Neither allele 1 nor allele 2 were associated with the presence of RF 
      (p=0.188 and p=0.106), overall carditis (p=0.578 and p=0.767), polyarthritis 
      (p=0.343 and p=0.313) and chorea (p=0.654 and p=0.633). CONCLUSION: In the 
      Brazilian population, the polymorphism of the IL-1ra gene is a relevant factor 
      for rheumatic heart disease severity.

TI  - Genetic variants of D2 but not D3 or D4 dopamine receptor gene are associated

PG  - 625-9

AB  - D2-like receptors are key targets for methamphetamine in the CNS, and their 
      activation is an initial and indispensable effect in the induction of dependence 
      and psychosis. It is possible that genetic variants of D2-like receptors may 
      affect individual susceptibility to methamphetamine dependence and psychosis. To 
      test this hypothesis, 6 putatively functional polymorphisms of D2-like receptors, 
      -141C Ins/Del, Ser311Cys and TaqIA of the DRD2 gene, Ser9Gly of the DRD3 gene, 
      and -521C>T and a variable number of tandem repeats in exon 3 of the DRD4 gene, 
      were analyzed in 202 patients with methamphetamine dependence and/or psychosis 
      and 243 healthy controls in a Japanese population. No polymorphism examined 
      showed significant association with methamphetamine dependence, but two 
      polymorphisms of DRD2 were associated with the clinical course and prognosis of 
      methamphetamine psychosis. The A1/A1 homozygote of DRD2 was a negative risk 
      factor for a poorer prognosis of psychosis that continues for more than 1 month 
      after the discontinuance of methamphetamine abuse and the beginning of treatment 
      with neuroleptics (p=0.04, odds ratio (OR)=0.42, 95% CI; 0.27-0.65) and the 
      complication of spontaneous relapse of methamphetamine psychosis after remission 
      (p=0.014, OR=0.34, 95% CI; 0.22-0.54). The genotype of -141C Del positive 
      (Del/Del and Del/Ins) was at risk for rapid onset of methamphetamine psychosis 
      that develops into a psychotic state within 3 years after initiation of 
      methamphetamine abuse (p=0.00037, OR=3.62, 95% CI 2.48-5.28). These findings 
      revealed that genetic variants of DRD2, but not DRD3 or DRD4, confer individual 
      risks for rapid onset, prolonged duration, and spontaneous relapse of 
      methamphetamine psychosis.

TI  - Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist intron 2 variable number of tandem repeats 
      polymorphism and respiratory failure in children with community-acquired 
      pneumonia.
PG  - 553-9
LID - 10.1097/PCC.0b013e31818d32f1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the variable nucleotide tandem repeat 
      polymorphism in intron 2 of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist gene is 
      associated with lung injury in children with community-acquired pneumonia. 
      DESIGN: A prospective cohort of children diagnosed with community-acquired 
      pneumonia. SETTING: Two pediatric hospitals. PATIENTS: Eight hundred fifty 
      pediatric patients with community-acquired pneumonia were enrolled. 
      INTERVENTIONS: Genotyping of the variable nucleotide tandem repeat polymorphism 
      in intron 2 of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist gene was performed on DNA 
      isolated from whole blood. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The requirement for 
      positive pressure ventilation or the diagnosis of acute lung injury or acute 
      respiratory distress syndrome were the main outcomes of the study. Children (14 
      days-19 yrs) with community-acquired pneumonia (850) were enrolled; analysis was 
      limited to African American (515) and Caucasian (232) patients. Of the 82 
      patients requiring positive pressure ventilation, 44 were diagnosed with acute 
      lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Multivariate logistic 
      regression analyses indicated that children without a copy of the A1 allele of 
      the variable nucleotide tandem repeat polymorphism in intron 2 of the 
      interleukin-1 receptor antagonist gene were more likely to need positive pressure 
      ventilation compared to those with one or two copies of this allele (odds ratio = 
      2.65, confidence interval, 1.02-6.90). In addition, the absence of the A1 allele 
      also appeared to be associated with the development of community-acquired 
      pneumonia-induced acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (odds 
      ratio = 3.1, confidence interval, 0.99-9.67). CONCLUSIONS: In children with 
      community-acquired pneumonia, absence of the A1 allele at the interleukin-1 
      receptor antagonist intron 2 polymorphic site is associated with increased risk 
      for more severe lung injury, as measured by the need for positive pressure 
      ventilation or the development of acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress 
      syndrome. Conversely, presence of the A1 allele is associated with decreased risk 
      for more severe lung injury in this patient population.

TI  - NREM sleep instability changes following rapid maxillary expansion in children 
      with obstructive apnea sleep syndrome.
PG  - 471-8
LID - 10.1016/j.sleep.2008.04.003 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate NREM sleep microstructure in children with obstructive 
      sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) before and after one year of rapid maxillary expander 
      (RME) treatment by means of the cyclic alternating pattern (CAP). METHODS: Nine 
      children with OSAS aged 4-8 years (6 males, mean age 6.4+/-1.97 years) and 
      age-matched normal controls were included. All subjects underwent an overnight 
      polysomnography in the sleep laboratory after one adaptation night, as a baseline 
      evaluation; children with OSAS were recorded again after one year of RME 
      treatment. RESULTS: After one year of treatment the OSAS group showed a longer 
      duration of time in bed and sleep period time, a reduction in number of stage 
      shifts compared to baseline recordings, and the apnea-hypopnea index decreased 
      significantly. At baseline, the OSAS group had a higher CAP rate during slow-wave 
      sleep and an increased A2 index compared to normal controls. After one year of 
      RME application, children with OSAS showed an increase in CAP rate associated 
      with an increase of A1 index during slow-wave sleep. CONCLUSIONS: RME treatment 
      almost normalized sleep architecture and improved sleep respiratory disturbances; 
      however, sleep microstructure and respiratory parameters did not completely 
      recover. The persistence of increased CAP rate in slow-wave sleep associated with 
      an increase of A1 index might reflect a partial failure of orthodontic treatment. 
      On the other hand, the rebound of A1 subtypes might be an indirect sign of an 
      attempt to normalize sleep that has been disturbed by the respiratory events.

TI  - Gene polymorphisms of TNF-alpha(-308), IL-10(-1082), IL-6(-174), and IL-1Ra(VNTR) 
      related to susceptibility and severity of rheumatic heart disease.
PG  - 363-71
AB  - Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is an inflammatory disease of the heart tissues 
      caused by interactive immune, genetic, and environmental factors. The objective 
      of this study is to test for the association of polymorphisms related to cytokine 
      genes with susceptibility and severity of RHD among affected children from the 
      Nile Delta region of Egypt. The study included 50 children with chronic RHD (29 
      males and 21 females), with a mean age of 12.2 years, in addition to 98 healthy 
      unrelated controls. Cases were further classified on the basis of 
      echocardiographic findings into those with only mitral valve disease (MVD) or 
      multivalvular lesions (MVLs) and also as mild, moderate, or severe valve lesions. 
      For all cases and controls, DNA was extracted and amplified using polymerase 
      chain reaction with sequence-specific primers for detection of single nucleotide 
      polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes tumor necrosis 
      factor (TNF)-alpha(-308 )G/A, interleukin (IL)-10(-1082 )G/A, and IL-6(-174 )G/C 
      as well as a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs) in intron 2 of the IL-1Ra 
      gene. All cases showed a significantly higher frequency of homozygous genotypes 
      of TNF-alpha(-308 )A/A [odds ratio (OR) = 5.7, p < 0.001], IL-10(-1082) A/A (OR = 
      3.1, p < 0.05), IL-10(-1082) G/G (OR = 5.2, p < 0.05), and IL-1Ra A1/A1 (OR = 
      2.2, p < 0.05). Cases with MVD showed higher frequencies of genotypes 
      TNF-alpha(-308 )A/A, G/G; IL-10(-1082) G/G; and IL-1Ra(VNTR) A1/A1 (p < 0.05). 
      Cases with MVL showed a significantly higher frequency of homozygous A/A genotype 
      of both TNF-alpha(-308 )(OR = 10.6, p < 0.05) and IL-10(-1082) (OR = 5.2, p < 
      0.05). The same was observed for cases with severe valve lesions. On the other 
      hand, all studied groups showed significantly lower frequency of heterozygous 
      genotypes of TNF-alpha(-308 )G/A, IL-10(-1082) G/A, and IL-1Ra(VNTR) A1/A2. No 
      significant difference was found regarding the frequency of IL-6(-174 )G/C 
      polymorphisms in total cases or subgroups compared to controls (p > 0.05). 
      Predisposition to RHD is influenced by genetic factors including cytokine gene 
      polymorphisms, with possible susceptibility to severe disease with multivalvular 
      affection among cases with composite polymorphism (TNF-alpha(-308 )A/A and 
      IL-10(-1082) A/A) and (TNF-alpha(-308 )A/A and IL-10(-1082) G/G).

TI  - D2 dopamine receptor gene haplotypes and their influence on alcohol and tobacco 
      consumption magnitude in alcohol-dependent individuals.
PG  - 258-66
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alcohol dependence and habitual smoking frequently co-occur and 
      possibly mutually influence each other. Both have been related to alterations of 
      dopaminergic neurotransmission. The aim of this analysis of the Munich Gene Data 
      Bank for Alcoholism(MGBA) was to re-evaluate the potential relation between D2 
      receptor and dopamine transporter gene haplotypes and quantity-related phenotypes 
      of alcohol consumption (average daily alcohol intake before admission for 
      treatment) and smoking (average units smoked per day). METHODS: A total of 333 
      inpatients (265 males) were enrolled in the study, all of who met the ICD10 
      diagnosis of alcohol dependence. Mild and strong quantity drinkers and smokers 
      were separated into groups by median split. A number of genetic markers were 
      chosen across D2 dopamine receptor gene (-141 Ins/Del, Taq1B, Taq1D, Ser311Cys; 
      rs1079594 (intron 7); Taq1A) and dopamine transporter (40bp variable number of 
      tandem repeat; rs2617605 (intron 2); rs37022 (intron 7); rs40184 (intron 14)). 
      Genotyping was performed using PCR. RESULTS: Strong drinkers reported 
      significantly higher amounts of smoking and vice versa. While no association was 
      detected for dopamine transporter genetic variants, a number of D2 receptor gene 
      single nucleotide polymorphisms were related to both smoking- and 
      drinking-related behaviours. Subsequent analysis of D2 receptor gene haplotypes 
      revealed that two common haplotypes had a significant association with 
      quantitative phenotypes of regular drinking (Ins-C-G-C-A1) and smoking 
      (Ins-T-G-A-A2). DISCUSSION: The finding of an association between common D2 
      dopamine receptor gene haplotypes with the quantity of drinking and smoking 
      corroborates with results from previous studies suggesting a relationship between 
      the dopamine system and alcohol and substance use disorders. Furthermore, it 
      makes D2 dopamine receptor a candidate gene significantly influencing both 
      alcohol and nicotine dependence.

TI  - Antipsychotic-induced extrapyramidal symptoms in patients with schizophrenia: 
      associations with dopamine and serotonin receptor and transporter polymorphisms.
PG  - 233-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the influence of polymorphisms of the dopamine 
      and serotonin system on the risk for extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) during 
      treatment with antipsychotic drugs. METHODS: Of 119 subjects with schizophrenia 
      treated with antipsychotics, 63 had current or previous EPS (acute dystonia, 
      parkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia), and 56 had no such symptoms. All subjects were 
      genotyped for a total of eight dopamine and serotonin receptor and transporter 
      polymorphisms: the Taq1A polymorphism of the dopamine D(2) receptor (DRD2) gene, 
      the Msc1 polymorphism of the dopamine D(3) receptor (DRD3) gene, the variable 
      number of tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism of the dopamine transporter (DAT1) 
      gene, four polymorphisms (102T/C, His452Tyr, 516 C/T, and Thr25Asn) of the 
      serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptor (5HTR2A) gene, and the 5HTTLPR polymorphism of the 
      serotonin transporter (5HTT) gene. RESULTS: The frequency of the A1 allele of the 
      DRD2 Taq1A polymorphism was significantly higher in the EPS group than in the 
      control group [16% vs. 7%, P = 0.040; odds ratio (OR) 2.4; 95% confidence 
      interval (CI) 1.1-5.7]. Also, the 9 repeat allele of the DAT1 VNTR polymorphism 
      was significantly more common in the EPS group (42% vs. 28%, P = 0.030; OR 1.9; 
      95% CI 1.1-3.3). Being a carrier of both DRD2 Taq1A A1 and DAT1 VNTR 9 repeat 
      alleles was also significantly associated with the occurrence of EPS (19% vs. 6%, 
      P = 0.040; OR 4.0; 95% CI 1.05-15.2) No significant differences in allele 
      frequencies were found for the other polymorphisms. CONCLUSION: Presence of the 
      Taq1A A1 allele of the DRD2 and the 9 repeat allele of the DAT1 VNTR 
      polymorphisms might be risk factors for EPS caused by antipsychotic drugs.

TI  - Possible interaction between MAOA and DRD2 genes associated with antisocial 
      alcoholism among Han Chinese men in Taiwan.
PG  - 108-14
AB  - Both monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) and dopamine D(2) receptor (DRD2) genes have been 
      considered as candidate genes for antisocial personality disorder with alcoholism 
      (Antisocial ALC) [Parsian, A., 1999. Sequence analysis of exon 8 of MAO-A gene in 
      alcoholics with antisocial personality and normal controls. Genomics. 45, 
      290-295.; Samochowiec, J., Lesch, K.P., Rottmann, M., Smolka, M., Syagailo, Y.V., 
      Okladnova, O., Rommelspacher, H., Winterer, G., Schmidt, L.G., Sander, T., 1999. 
      Association of a regulatory polymorphism in the promoter region of the monoamine 
      oxidase A gene with antisocial alcoholism. Psychiatry. Res. 86, 67-72.; Schmidt, 
      L.vG., Sander, T., Kuhn, S., Smolka, M., Rommelspacher, H., Samochowiec, J., 
      Lesch, K.P., 2000. Different allele distribution of a regulatory MAO-A gene 
      promotor polymorphism in antisocial and anxious-depressive alcoholics. J. Neural 
      .Transm. 107, 681-689.]. However, the association between alcoholism and MAOA or 
      DRD2 gene has not been universally accepted [Lee, J.F., Lu, R.B., Ko, H.C., 
      Chang, F.M., Yin, S.J., Pakstis, A.J., Kidd, K.K., 1999. No association between 
      DRD(2) locus and alcoholism after controlling the ADH and ALDH genotypes in 
      Chinese Han population. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 23, 592-599.; Lu, R.B., Lin, 
      W.W., Lee, J.F., Ko, H.C., Shih, J.C., 2003. Neither antisocial personality 
      disorder nor antisocial alcoholism association with MAOA gene among Han Chinese 
      males in Taiwan. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 27, 889-893.]. Since dopamine is 
      metabolized to 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-acetaldehyde (DOPAL) via monoamine oxidase 
      (MAO) [Westerink, B.H., de Vries, J.B., 1985. On the origin of dopamine and its 
      metabolite in predominantly noradrenergic innervated brain areas. Brain. Res. 
      330, 164-166.], the interaction between MAOA and DRD2 genes might be related to 
      Antisocial ALC. The present study aimed to determine whether Antisocial ALC might 
      be associated with the possible interactions of DRD2 gene with MAOA gene. Of the 
      231 Han Chinese subjects who were recruited for the study, 73 participants were 
      diagnosed with Antisocial ALC and 158 subjects were diagnosed with antisocial 
      personality disorder without alcoholism (Antisocial Non-ALC). The DRD2 TaqI A and 
      MAOA-uVNTR (variable number of tandem repeat located upstream) polymorphisms were 
      not found to be associated with Antisocial ALC. However, an association between 
      DRD2 TaqI A polymorphisms and Antisocial ALC was shown only after stratification 
      for the MAOA-uVNTR 4-repeat polymorphism. Additionally, after multiple logistic 
      regressions, we found that, under stratification of MAOA-uVNTR 4-repeat 
      polymorphism and in comparison with the DRD2 A1/A1 genotype as a reference group, 
      the DRD2 A1/A2 genotype has a possible protective effect against alcoholism in 
      individuals with antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). We concluded that the 
      possible interactions between MAOA-uVNTR polymorphism and DRD2 TaqI A 
      polymorphism might be related to Antisocial ALC among Han Chinese men in Taiwan.

TI  - Association of the polymorphisms of genes involved in androgen metabolism and 
      signaling pathways with familial prostate cancer risk in a Japanese population.
PG  - 262-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Androgen plays a central role in the normal and malignant development 
      of prostate glands. Genetic polymorphisms of genes involved in androgen 
      metabolism and signaling might be associated with the risk of prostate cancer. 
      METHODS: One hundred and two patients with prostate cancer with a family history 
      and 117 healthy age- and residence-matched male controls were enrolled. Genotypes 
      of the CAG repeat length of androgen receptor (AR), CYP17, 5alpha-reductase type 
      II (SRD5A2), UDG-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B15, PSA promoter genes were 
      analyzed. RESULTS: For single polymorphisms, the presence of Y alleles showed a 
      significantly lower risk of prostate cancer in comparison with the D/D genotype 
      in UGT2B15 (odds ratio [OR]=0.41, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.40-4.28, 
      p=0.0015), and the presence of A2 alleles showed a weak tendency to decrease 
      prostate cancer risk in comparison with the A1/A1 genotype in CYP17 (OR=0.69, 95% 
      CI=0.39-1.23, p=0.21). The stratification of cases according to clinical stage 
      and pathological grade showed that the A2/A2 genotype was significantly 
      associated with localized stage cancer in comparison with metastatic stage cancer 
      (OR=5.18, 95% CI=1.49-17.95, p=0.007). The combination of UGT2B15 and CYP17 
      genotypes could identify higher risk subjects even in subjects with low-risk 
      UGT2B15 genotypes, i.e., Y/Y+D/Y genotypes (OR=1.97, 95% CI=0.92-4.22, p=0.079). 
      CONCLUSION: Genetic polymorphisms of the genes involved in androgen metabolism 
      and signaling were significantly associated with familial prostate cancer risk. 
      Single nucleotide polymorphisms of low-penetrance genes could be targets to 
      understand genetic susceptibility to familial prostate cancer.

TI  - Molecular mechanisms for maintenance of G-rich short tandem repeats capable of 
      adopting G4 DNA structures.
PG  - 120-31
AB  - Mammalian genomes contain several types of repetitive sequences. Some of these 
      sequences are implicated in various specific cellular events, including meiotic 
      recombination, chromosomal breaks and transcriptional regulation, and also in 
      several human disorders. In this review, we document the formation of DNA 
      secondary structures by the G-rich repetitive sequences that have been found in 
      several minisatellites, telomeres and in various triplet repeats, and report 
      their effects on in vitro DNA synthesis. d(GGCAG) repeats in the mouse 
      minisatellite Pc-1 were demonstrated to form an intra-molecular folded-back 
      quadruplex structure (also called a G4' structure) by NMR and CD spectrum 
      analyses. d(TTAGGG) telomere repeats and d(CGG) triplet repeats were also shown 
      to form G4' and other unspecified higher order structures, respectively. In vitro 
      DNA synthesis was substantially arrested within the repeats, and this could be 
      responsible for the preferential mutability of the G-rich repetitive sequences. 
      Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using NIH3T3 cell extracts revealed 
      heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 and A3, which were tightly and 
      specifically bound to d(GGCAG) and d(TTAGGG) repeats with K(d) values in the 
      order of nM. HnRNP A1 unfolded the G4' structure formed in the d(GGCAG)(n) and 
      d(TTAGGG)(n) repeat regions, and also resolved the higher order structure formed 
      by d(CGG) triplet repeats. Furthermore, DNA synthesis arrest at the secondary 
      structures of d(GGCAG) repeats, telomeres and d(CGG) triplet repeats was 
      efficiently repressed by the addition of hnRNP A1. High expression of hnRNPs may 
      contribute to the maintenance of G-rich repetitive sequences, including telomere 
      repeats, and may also participate in ensuring the stability of the genome in 
      cells with enhanced proliferation. Transcriptional regulation of genes, such as 
      c-myc and insulin, by G4 sequences found in the promoter regions could be an 
      intriguing field of research and help further elucidate the biological functions 
      of the hnRNP family of proteins in human diseases.

TI  - Unfolding of higher DNA structures formed by the d(CGG) triplet repeat by UP1 
      protein.
PG  - 953-62
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is caused by expansion of a d(CGG) triplet repeat in the 
      5'-untranslated region of the first exon of the FMR1 gene resulting in silencing 
      of the gene. The d(CGG) repeat has been reported to form hairpin and quadruplex 
      structures in vitro, and formation of these higher structures could be 
      responsible for its unstable expansion in the syndrome, although molecular 
      mechanisms underlying the repeat expansion still remain elusive. We have 
      previously proved that UP1, a proteolytic product of hnRNP A1, unfolds the 
      intramolecular quadruplex structures of d(GGCAG)5 and d(TTAGGG)4 and abrogates 
      the arrest of DNA synthesis at d(GGG)n sites. Here, we demonstrate that the 
      d(CGG) repeat forms a peculiar DNA structure, which deviates from the canonical 
      B-form structure. In addition, UP1 was demonstrated by CD spectrum analysis to 
      unfold this characteristic higher structure of the d(CGG) repeat and to abrogate 
      the arrest of DNA synthesis at the site. This ability of UP1 suggests that 
      unfolding of unusual DNA structures of a triplet repeat is required for DNA 
      synthesis processes.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the long-term clinical responses of 
      rapid maxillary expansion as the only treatment performed in Class I malocclusion 
      using the Haas-type appliance. The longitudinal sample consisted of 90 sets of 
      study models from 30 consecutive patients (12 males and 18 females) selected on 
      the basis of the following inclusion criteria: all patients (1) had a Class I 
      malocclusion with transverse maxillary/mandibular skeletal discrepancies, (2) 
      were treated nonextraction in the early/ mid mixed dentition, (3) presented with 
      mandibular dental arches with mild or no crowding, and (4) had no subsequent 
      comprehensive orthodontic treatment implemented in either the maxilla or the 
      mandible. The mean age was 8.2 years when treatment was initiated. Treatment 
      outcomes were evaluated at pretreatment A1, short-term follow-up (one year after 
      A1) A2, and long-term follow-up (four years after A2) A3. The changes in 
      maxillary arch width and arch length were quantified and compared among 
      assessment stages A1, A2, and A3 using the Student's t-test. The results 
      demonstrated a highly significant increase in maxillary arch width in both the 
      short- and long-term follow-ups. The arch width increased significantly during 
      treatment and decreased slightly during the long-term follow-up. The long-term 
      clinical response demonstrated the efficacy and stability of this type of 
      treatment in achieving maxillary arch width. The follow-up examination during the 
      early/mid/permanent dentition confirmed the validity of overtreatment.

TI  - Association analysis between interleukin-1 family polymorphisms and generalized 
      aggressive periodontitis in a Chinese population.
PG  - 1627-35
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that aggressive periodontitis (AgP) has a 
      genetic basis, but this theory has not been confirmed. The intent of this 
      investigation was to study whether specific interleukin (IL)-1 genotypes and/or 
      alleles could be used to predict susceptibility to generalized AgP (GAgP) in 
      Chinese. METHODS: The GAgP group consisted of 122 patients, and the control group 
      included 95 healthy subjects. Single nucleotide polymorphisms at IL-1A (+4845) 
      and IL-1B (-511, +3954) were analyzed by standard polymerase chain 
      reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay. The 
      polymorphism of a variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) in intron 2 of IL-1RN was 
      detected by PCR amplification and fragment size analysis. RESULTS: There was no 
      significant association of IL-1 polymorphisms with GAgP in the unstratified 
      subjects. However, when cases were stratified by gender, the frequencies of A2+ 
      genotype and allele 2 at IL-1A +4845 were significantly increased in male 
      patients compared to male controls (genotype: odds ratio [OR] 5.58, 95% 
      confidence interval [CI]: 1.09 to 28.68, P = 0.039; allele: OR 4.97, 95% CI: 1.01 
      to 24.50, P = 0.049; adjusted for age and smoking status). The frequency of IL-1B 
      -511 A1/A2 heterozygote was significantly increased in male GAgP group compared 
      to male controls (adjusted OR 3.16, 95% CI: 1.01 to 9.89, P = 0.048). In females, 
      no significant differences were found between patients and controls in 
      corresponding analyses at all polymorphic loci. A possible combined effect of 
      IL-1B -511 polymorphism and smoking on the elevated risk to GAgP was observed. 
      The OR of GAgP for combined A2+ genotype and smoking was 12.45 (95% CI: 1.43 to 
      108.06, P = 0.022), and for combined allele 2 and smoking was 18.25 (95% CI: 2.32 
      to 143.86, P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: The polymorphisms of IL-1A +4845 and IL-1B 
      -511 may play an important role in determining GAgP susceptibility in Chinese 
      males. Furthermore, a possible combined effect of the polymorphism of IL-1B -511 
      and smoking on GAgP susceptibility was suggested.

TI  - Spontaneous mandibular arch response after rapid palatal expansion: a long-term 
      study on Class I malocclusion.
PG  - 576-82
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the spontaneous mandibular arch 
      response to rapid palatal expansion as the sole orthodontic intervention. 
      Particular attention was paid to clinically significant effects and long-term 
      (mean age, 11.3 years) posttreatment stability in 30 Class I malocclusion 
      patients treated during the early and mid mixed dentition. Measurements were made 
      directly on 120 dental casts obtained at 4 assessment stages: pre-expansion (A1), 
      short-term follow-up (A2), progress (A3), and long-term follow up (A4). 
      Comparisons between A1 and A2 showed statistically significant (P < .001) 
      increases for intermolar widths (lingual and occlusal values). During the 
      transition to the permanent dentition, a significant (P < .001) decrease occurred 
      in arch length and arch perimeter. There was a 25% intermolar width (occlusal 
      value) decrease from the initial net gain, whereas the lingual values remained 
      unchanged. Comparisons between A2 and A4 showed an intermolar width (occlusal 
      value) net gain of 50% and a significant (P < .001) decrease for the arch length 
      and arch perimeter. There was remarkable stability in intermolar width (lingual 
      value) and intercanine width (occlusal value), indicating that the increase in 
      the mandibular arch width dimension was in response to the orthopedic effects of 
      rapid palatal expansion in the early and mid-mixed dentition and that the 
      stability was maintained until adulthood.

TI  - Polyglutamation of methotrexate with common polymorphisms in reduced folate 
      carrier, aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase, and 
      thymidylate synthase are associated with methotrexate effects in rheumatoid 
      arthritis.
PG  - 2766-74
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Methotrexate (MTX) enters cells through the reduced folate carrier 
      (RFC-1) and exerts part of its effects through polyglutamation to MTX 
      polyglutamates (MTXPGs) and inhibition of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 
      ribonucleotide transformylase (ATIC) and thymidylate synthase (TS). We 
      investigated the contribution of common genetic polymorphisms in RFC-1 (G80A), 
      ATIC (C347G), and TS (28-bp tandem repeats located in the TS enhancer region 
      [TSER*2/*3]) and of MTXPGs to the effect of MTX in patients with rheumatoid 
      arthritis. METHODS: The study was cross-sectional. All patients received MTX for 
      at least 3 months. The numbers of tender and swollen joints, the Visual Analog 
      Scale (VAS) scores for the physician's global assessment of disease activity, and 
      the modified Health Assessment Questionnaire scores were collected. Using the VAS 
      score for the physician's assessment of patient's response to MTX, the population 
      of patients was dichotomized into responders to MTX (VAS score < or =2 cm) and 
      nonresponders to MTX (VAS score >2 cm). A pharmacogenetic index was calculated as 
      the sum of homozygous variant genotypes (RFC-1 AA + ATIC 347GG + TSER *2/*2) 
      carried by the patients. MTXPG concentrations were measured in red blood cells 
      (RBCs) by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The dose of MTX was 
      not associated with the effects of MTX (P > 0.05). In contrast, increased RBC 
      long-chain MTXPG concentrations (median 40 nmoles/liter; range <5-131 
      nmoles/liter) and an increased pharmacogenetic index were associated with a lower 
      number of tender and swollen joints (P < 0.05) and a lower score for the 
      physician's global assessment of disease activity (P < or = 0.001). Patients with 
      RBC MTXPG levels of >60 nmoles/liter and carriers of a homozygous variant 
      genotype were 14.0-fold (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 3.6-53.8) and 3.7-fold 
      (95% CI 1.7-9.1), respectively, more likely to have a good response to MTX (P <or 
      = 0.01). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that measuring RBC MTXPG levels and/or 
      the common polymorphisms in the folate-purine-pyrimidine pathway may help in 
      monitoring MTX therapy.

TI  - Association of genetic polymorphisms in the fibrinogen and platelet glycoprotein 
      genes with unstable angina in Chinese patients.
PG  - 455-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inherited predisposition has been associated with coronary artery 
      disease (CAD) in the white population. HYPOTHESIS: The objective of this study 
      was to investigate the association between the risk of unstable angina (UA) and 
      genetic factors believed to be associated with an increased tendency toward 
      thrombosis (the variable number of tandem repeats [VNTR] polymorphism of the 
      platelet glycoprotein [GP] Ib alpha gene, Pl(A1/A2) of the platelet GP IIIa gene, 
      448G/A of the Bbeta fibrinogen gene and Thr312Ala of the Aalpha fibrinogen gene) 
      in Chinese patients with UA. METHODS: We performed a case/control study 
      evaluating 69 Chinese patients (43 men, 26 women) with UA and 69 control subjects 
      without CAD, individually matched for age and gender. The restriction fragment 
      length polymorphism (RFLP) method was used to determine the genetic 
      polymorphisms. RESULTS: The frequencies of GP Ib alpha C/B genotype and Bbeta 
      fibrinogen 448A allele were higher in patients with UA (46.4 vs. 30.4%, odds 
      ratio [OR] 1.977, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98-3.97, p = 0.054, and 49.3 vs. 
      20.3%, OR 3.816, 95% CI 1.797-8.103, p = 0.000, respectively). Only four subjects 
      (two cases, two controls) with GP IIIa Pl(A2) allele were found, and there was no 
      association between Aalpha fibrinogen Thr312Ala polymorphism and UA. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Chinese patients with UA had increased frequencies of GP Ib alpha C/B genotype 
      and Bbeta fibrinogen 448A allele. These data suggest that some genetic factors 
      may influence the development of UA.

TI  - Destabilization of tetraplex structures of the fragile X repeat sequence (CGG)n 
      is mediated by homolog-conserved domains in three members of the hnRNP family.
PG  - 4145-54
AB  - Hairpin or tetrahelical structures formed by a d(CGG)n sequence in the FMR1 gene 
      are thought to promote expansion of the repeat tract. Subsequent to this 
      expansion FMR1 is silenced and fragile X syndrome ensues. The injurious effects 
      of d(CGG)n secondary structures may potentially be countered by agents that act 
      to decrease their stability. We showed previously that the hnRNP-related protein 
      CBF-A destabilized G'2 bimolecular tetraplex structures of d(CGG)n. Analysis of 
      mutant proteins revealed that the CBF-A-conserved domains RNP11 and ATP/GTP 
      binding box were sufficient and necessary for G'2 d(CGG)n disruption while the 
      RNP21 motif inhibited the destabilization activity. Here, we report that a 
      C-terminal fragment of CBF-A whose only remaining conserved domain was the 
      ATP/GTP binding motif, disrupted G'2 d(CGG)n more selectively than wild-type 
      CBF-A. Further, two additional members of the hnRNP family, hnRNP A2 and mutant 
      hnRNP A1 effectively destabilized G'2 d(CGG)n. Examination of mutant hnRNP A2 
      proteins revealed that, similar to CBF-A, their RNP11 element and ATP/GTP binding 
      motif mediated G'2 d(CGG)n disruption, while the RNP21 element blocked their 
      action. Similarly, the RNP11 and RNP21 domains of hnRNP A1 were, respectively, 
      positive and negative mediators of G'2 d(CGG)n destabilization. Last, employing 
      the same conserved motifs that mediated disruption of the DNA tetraplex G'2 
      d(CGG)n, hnRNP A2 destabilized r(CGG)n RNA tetraplex.

TI  - The matrix protein pp65(341-350): a peptide that induces ex vivo stimulation and 
      in vitro expansion of CMV-specific CD8+ T cells in subjects bearing either 
      HLA-A*2402 or A*0101 allele.
PG  - 1567-74
AB  - BACKGROUND: The stimulation of PBMNCs with HLA Class I restricted synthetic 
      peptides derived from CMV phosphorylated matrix protein 65 (pp65) evokes 
      CMV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity, a necessary condition for 
      initiating adoptive immunotherapy against CMV-related diseases in 
      immune-compromised patients. It was previously demonstrated that the CMV decamer 
      (10-mer) peptide pp65(341-350), QYDPVAALFF, was able to induce CMV-specific CTLs 
      in HLA-A*2402 CMV-seropositive individuals. STUDY DESIGN AND METHOD: We 
      investigated the ability of the peptide pp65(341-350) to reactivate memory CD8+ T 
      cells in CMV-seropositive subjects bearing either the HLA-A24 or A1 allele. CTL 
      responses were measured by IFN-gamma mRNA expression and IFN-gamma protein 
      production as well as cytotoxic activity. RESULTS: In this study it was found 
      that peptide pp65(341-350) induced a specific reactivation of memory CD8+ T cells 
      from CMV-seropositive donors expressing either HLA-A*2402 and/or HLA-A*0101. 
      Moreover, a pp65(341-350)-specific selection and expansion using PBMNCs of 
      CMV-seropositive donors bearing both HLA-A*2402 and HLA-A*0101 alleles produced 
      cytotoxic CTLs to both HLA-A24 and A1 peptide-pulsed and autologous CMV-infected 
      target cells. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that pp65(341-350) induced a 
      specific CTL activity at both molecular and protein levels and that the peptide 
      is specifically processed, presented, and recognized by subjects bearing 
      HLA-A*2402 and/or A*0101. These findings suggest that it may be possible to use 
      this single immune dominant peptide to induce and expand CMV-reactive CTLs for 
      the treatment of individuals with both HLA-A24 and A1 types.

TI  - Lack of association of alpha-1 antichymotrypsin gene polymorphism with PR3-ANCA 
      and MPO-ANCA associated vasculitis.
PG  - 435-9
AB  - In patients with PR3-ANCA associated vasculitides the carrier frequency of 
      alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency allele PI*Z is increased and linkage 
      disequilibrium between polymorphic markers within a cluster of serine protease 
      inhibitor (serpin) genes, including AAT gene, at chromosome 14q32.1 has been 
      described. A1-antichymotrypsin (AACT), part of an extended serpin gene cluster, 
      was discussed to contribute to PR3-ANCA associated vasculitis formation. To 
      analyse, if an AACT gene polymorphism within the signal peptide sequence is 
      associatedwith antineutrophil cytoplasm autoantibodies (ANCA) vasculitis allelic 
      frequencies of AACT polymorphism were analysed in 128 control persons, 79 
      PR3-ANCA, and 30 MPO-ANCA patients. In MPO-ANCA patients also phenotyping of AAT 
      was performed as well as frequency and linkage analysis of simple tandem repeat 
      polymorphisms in the genes of cortisol-binding globulin, AAT, protein C 
      inhibitor, and three extragenic markers (S48, S55, S51) of the gene cluster. 
      Allelic frequencies of the AACT polymorphism did not differ between controls and 
      vasculitis patients. In the MPO-ANCA group no patient expressed the Pi*Z 
      defective allele of AAT and the allelic frequencies of polymorphic markers within 
      the serpin gene cluster did not differ from those of the controls. Strong linkage 
      disequilibrium was detected in MPO-ANCA patients neither. Therefore, we can not 
      support the hypothesis that AACT polymorphism contributes to the pathogenesis of 
      PR3-ANCA vasculitis. Nor is it probable that any factor, coded by the serpin gene 
      cluster, contributes to MPO-ANCA vasculitis.

TI  - Replication and expansion of trinucleotide repeats in yeast.
PG  - 1349-57
AB  - The mechanisms of trinucleotide repeat expansions, underlying more than a dozen 
      hereditary neurological disorders, are yet to be understood. Here we looked at 
      the replication of (CGG)(n) x (CCG)(n) and (CAG)(n) x (CTG)(n) repeats and their 
      propensity to expand in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using electrophoretic analysis 
      of replication intermediates, we found that (CGG)(n) x (CCG)(n) repeats 
      significantly attenuate replication fork progression. Replication inhibition for 
      this sequence becomes evident at as few as approximately 10 repeats and reaches a 
      maximal level at 30 to 40 repeats. This is the first direct demonstration of 
      replication attenuation by a triplet repeat in a eukaryotic system in vivo. For 
      (CAG)(n) x (CTG)(n) repeats, on the contrary, there is only a marginal 
      replication inhibition even at 80 repeats. The propensity of trinucleotide 
      repeats to expand was evaluated in a parallel genetic study. In wild-type cells, 
      expansions of (CGG)(25) x (CCG)(25) and (CAG)(25) x (CTG)(25) repeat tracts 
      occurred with similar low rates. A mutation in the large subunit of the 
      replicative replication factor C complex (rfc1-1) increased the expansion rate 
      for the (CGG)(25) repeat approximately 50-fold but had a much smaller effect on 
      the expansion of the (CTG)(25) repeat. These data show dramatic sequence-specific 
      expansion effects due to a mutation in the lagging strand DNA synthesis 
      machinery. Together, the results of this study suggest that expansions are likely 
      to result when the replication fork attempts to escape from the stall site.

TI  - Haplotype study of West European and North African Unverricht-Lundborg 
      chromosomes: evidence for a few founder mutations.
PG  - 255-62
AB  - Unverricht-Lundborg disease (ULD) is a progressive myoclonus epilepsy common in 
      Finland and North Africa, and less common in Western Europe. ULD is mostly caused 
      by expansion of a dodecamer repeat in the cystatin B gene ( CSTB) promoter. We 
      performed a haplotype study of ULD chromosomes (ULDc) with the repeat expansion. 
      We included 48 West European Caucasian (WEC) and 47 North African (NA) ULDc. We 
      analysed eight markers flanking CSTB(GT10-D21S1890-D21S1885-D21S2040-D21S1259- 
      CSTB-D21S1912-PFKL-D21S171) and one intragenic variant in the CSTB 3' UTR 
      (A2575G). We observed a founder effect in most of the NA ULD patients, as 61.7% 
      of the NA ULDc (29/47) shared the same haplotype, A1 (1-1-A-1-6-7), for markers 
      D21S1885-D21S2040-A2575G-D21S1259-D21S1912-PFKL. Moreover, if we considered only 
      the markers D21S1885, D21S2040, A2575G and D21S1259, 43 of the 47 NA ULDc shared 
      the same alleles 1-1-A-1, haplotype A. As previously shown, the WEC ULDc were 
      heterogeneous. However, the Baltic haplotype, A3 (5-1-1-A-1-1), was observed in 
      ten WEC ULDc (20.8%) and the CSTB 3'UTR variant, which we called the Alps 
      variant, was observed in 17 ULDc (35.4%). Finally, as almost all NA patients, 
      like Scandinavian patients, were of the haplotype A, we assumed that there was an 
      ancient common founder effect in NA and Baltic ULD patients. We estimated that 
      the putative most recent common ancestral ULD carrier with this haplotype A must 
      have existed about 2,500 years ago (100-150 generations). Finally, this work 
      provides evidence for the existence of only a small number of founder mutations 
      in ULD.

TI  - Tandem repeat polymorphism of the CYP2E1 gene: an association study with 
      esophageal cancer and lung cancer.
PG  - 15S-19S
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cytochrome P-450 (CYP) enzymes have been shown to play important 
      roles in chemical carcinogenesis. Reports have indicated that polymorphism in 
      CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2E1, and CYP2D6 are associated with an altered risk of 
      developing cancers of the lung, bladder, liver, and colon. CYP2E1 plays an 
      important role in alcohol metabolism and participates in the metabolic activation 
      of various carcinogens, such as N-nitrosodimethylamine. Recently, we found 
      repeated sequences that consist of four alleles (A1, A2, A3, and A4) and six 
      genotypes (A1/A2, A2/A2, A2/A3, A2/A4, A3/A4 and A4/A4) of the CYP2E1 gene. In 
      the present study, we investigated whether these polymorphisms are associated 
      with lung cancer and esophageal cancer. METHODS: DNA was isolated from blood 
      samples of 192 healthy control subjects, 85 patients with lung cancer, and 82 
      patients with esophageal cancer in Japanese males. DNA samples were amplified by 
      polymerase chain reaction in the 5'-flanking region of the CYP2E1 gene and in 
      exon 12 in the ALDH2 gene. The tandem repeat polymorphisms were examined using 
      DNA fragment analysis. Missense mutations in exon 12 of the ALDH2 gene were 
      examined using fluorescence-based single strand conformational change 
      polymorphism analysis. Written informed consent was obtained from all the 
      subjects. RESULTS: In the CYP2E1 gene 5'-flanking region polymorphism, patients 
      with esophageal cancer showed significantly higher frequency of the A4/A4 
      genotype compared with the control subjects (p = 0.02), but no difference was 
      found in patients with lung cancer. The frequencies of the mutant ALDH2*2 allele 
      were significantly higher in patients with esophageal cancer (27.7%) than in 
      healthy control subjects (7.3%; p< 0.0001; habitual alcohol drinkers). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of genotypes and allele frequencies of the tandem 
      repeats of the 5'-flanking region of the CYP2E1 gene was significantly different 
      in patients with esophageal cancer.

TI  - Genomic polymorphism within interleukin-1 family cytokines influences the outcome 
      of septic patients.
PG  - 1046-50
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the allele frequencies and genotype distribution of 
      interleukin-1alpha, interleukin-1beta, and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist gene 
      polymorphism in septic patients. DESIGN: Prospective, consecutive entry study of 
      septic patients in a general intensive care unit. SETTING: A 14-bed general 
      intensive care unit of a university hospital. PATIENTS: Sixty patients with 
      diagnosis of sepsis, admitted to the intensive care unit between 1997 and 1999. 
      INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: The polymorphic regions within 
      intron 6 of interleukin-1alpha gene containing variable numbers of a tandem 
      repeat (VNTR) of 46 base pairs, and intron 2 of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist 
      gene containing VNTR of 86 base pairs, were amplified by means of polymerase 
      chain reaction. Alleles A1-4 and RN1-4 were identified according to the size of 
      amplified DNA product. The region containing the AvaI polymorphic site at 
      position -511 of interleukin-1beta gene was amplified by polymerase chain 
      reaction and subsequently digested with AvaI restriction enzyme. The allele 
      frequencies of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist RN2 and genotype RN2/2 were 
      increased in 60 septic patients compared with normal controls (p <.01 and.05, 
      respectively). Allele frequencies or genotype distribution of interleukin-1alpha 
      VNTR gene polymorphism and interleukin-1beta AvaI polymorphism did not differ 
      between septic patients and normal controls. In addition, genotypes A2/2, B2/2, 
      and RN2/2 were associated with a significantly higher mortality rate (70% to 80%) 
      in septic patients. Patients with any two of the three alleles (i.e., A2, B2, and 
      RN2) suffered from much more severe sepsis (as measured by the Acute Physiology 
      and Chronic Health Evaluation II and Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome score) 
      and a higher mortality rate (55% to 65%), whereas septic patients with genotypes 
      A1/1, B1/1, or RN1/1 showed a much lower mortality rate (0% to 13%). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Allele interleukin-1RN2, but not interleukin-1A or interleukin-1B gene 
      polymorphism, was associated with susceptibility to sepsis. Alleles A2, B2, and 
      RN2 might be important high-risk genetic markers for sepsis.

      retention. ECF volume-expanded rats received aldosterone by osmotic minipump plus 
      a diet containing a high level of NaCl. Control rats received the same infusion 
      of aldosterone plus a virtually NaCl-free diet, which prevented ECF volume 
      expansion. Preliminary measurements demonstrated transient positive Na and water 
      balance, decreased serum urea concentration, and increased urea clearance, but no 
      change in creatinine clearance. Immunoblotting of homogenates from inner medulla 
      showed a marked decrease in the abundance of the collecting duct urea 
      transporters UT-A1 and UT-A3. There were no differences in the abundance of 
      UT-A2, aquaporin (AQP)-2, AQP-3, or AQP-4 in ECF volume-expanded rats vs. 
      controls. Time course experiments demonstrated that changes in UT-A1 abundance 
      paralleled the fall in serum urea concentration after the switch from a low-NaCl 
      to a high-NaCl diet, whereas the fall in UT-A3 abundance was delayed. Candesartan 
      administration markedly decreased the abundance of UT-A1 and UT-A3 in the renal 
      inner medulla, which is consistent with a role for the angiotensin II type 1 
      receptor in urea transport regulation. The results support the view that 
      ECF-related changes in serum urea concentration are mediated, at least in part, 
      through altered urea transporter abundance.

TI  - Susceptibility for and clinical manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis are 
      associated with polymorphisms of the TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-1Ra genes.
PG  - 212-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the association of genetic polymorphisms of 
      pro-inflammatory cytokines with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in comparison with 
      healthy controls from Northern Sweden and the potential contribution of these 
      genetic variants for disease severity and development of cardiovascular 
      complications. METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction amplification was used for 
      analysis of TaqI restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of interleukin-1 
      beta (IL-1beta), variable tandem repeat polymorphism of IL-I receptor antagonist 
      (IL-1Ra) gene and NcoI RFLP at position -308 of tumor necrosis factor-alpha 
      (TNF-alpha) gene. One hundred and fifty-four patients with RA, 42 men and 112 
      women, were consecutively recruited into the study through the Department of 
      Rheumatology. RESULTS: The allele A1 of TNF-alpha was more common in the patient 
      group (p < 0.01; OR = 1.62). Patients having the genotype A1A2 seemed to develop 
      more severe disease compared with patients with A1A1 genotype: they were younger 
      at disease onset (p < 0.05), had a higher accumulated disease activity (p < 0.05) 
      and worse functional class (p < 0.05). Patients with genotype A2A2 of IL- 1beta 
      had higher accumulated disease activity score than patients with A1A1 and A1A2 (p 
      < 0.05). The allelic combination Al IL-1beta/A2 IL-1Ra was less prevalent in RA 
      patients who developed cardiovascular complications (p < 0.005; OR = 0.20). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The Al allele of TNF-alpha associates with RA. Genotypes A1A2 of 
      TNF-alpha and A2A2 of IL-1beta are associated with more severe disease. The 
      allelic combination A1IL-1beta/A2 IL-1Ra is less often present in RA patients who 
      developed cardiovascular complications.

TI  - Short tandem repeat (STR) haplotypes in HLA: an integrated 50-kb STR/linkage 
      disequilibrium/gene map between the RING3 and HLA-B genes and identification of 
      STR haplotype diversification in the class III region.
PG  - 590-8
AB  - We present a dense STR/linkage disequilibrium(LD)/gene map between the RING3 and 
      HLA-B loci, reference allelic sizes on the most prevalent HLA haplotypes and 
      their allelic frequencies in pedigree founders. This resource will facilitate LD, 
      evolution and gene mapping studies, including comparisons of HLA and STR 
      haplotypes and identification of HLA recombinants. The map was constructed by 
      testing novel and previously reported STRs using a panel of 885 individuals in 
      211 families and 60 DNA samples from cell lines and bone marrow donors homozygous 
      in the HLA-A, -B and -DR loci selected from over 15 000 entries into the registry 
      of Swedish bone marrow donors. We have also analysed the variability of STR 
      alleles/haplotypes on the most prevalent HLA haplotypes to identify STRs useful 
      for fine mapping of disease genes in the region previously implicated in 
      susceptibility to many disorders. The analysis of 40 HLA-A*01, B*0801, 
      DRB1*03011, DQB1*0201 haplotypes in homozygous donors showed a surprising 
      stability in 23 STRs between the class II recombination hot spot and HLA-B, with 
      the average of 1.9% (16/838) variant alleles. However, 40% variant alleles were 
      found at the D6S2670 locus in intron 19 of the tenascin-X gene both in the 
      families and homozygous donors. The nucleotide sequence analysis of this STR 
      showed a complex polymorphism consisting of tetra- (CTTT)(8-18) and 
      penta-nucleotide (CTTTT)(1-2) repeats, separated by an intervening 
      non-polymorphic sequence of 42 bp. The HLA-A1, B*0801, DRB1*03011, DQB1*0201 
      haplotypes had five (CTTT)(14-18)/(CTTTT)(2) variants with a predominant 
      (CTTT)(16) allele, implicating the tetranucleotide component as the source of 
      this ancestral haplotype diversification, which may be due to the location of 
      D6S2670 in the region of the highest GC content in the human MHC.

      mage-A1/A3-positive tumors.
PG  - 937-43
AB  - Assessment of T-cell activation is pivotal for evaluation of cancer 
      immunotherapy. We initiated a clinical trial in patients with MAGE-A1 and/or -A3 
      tumors using autologous DC pulsed with MAGE peptides aimed at analyzing 
      T-cell-derived, IFN-gamma secretion by cytokine flow cytometry and ELISPOT. We 
      also tested whether further KLH addition could influence this response favorably. 
      Monocyte-derived DC were generated from leukapheresis products. They were pulsed 
      with the relevant MAGE peptide(s) alone in group A (n=10 pts) and additionally 
      with KLH in group B (n=16 pts). A specific but transient increase in the number 
      of peripheral blood T lymphocytes secreting IFN-gamma in response to the vaccine 
      peptide(s) was observed in 6/8 patients of group A and in 6/16 patients of group 
      B. We conclude that anti-tumor vaccination using DC pulsed with MAGE peptides 
      induces a potent but transient anti-MAGE, IFN-gamma secretion that is not 
      influenced by the additional delivery of a nonspecific, T-cell help.

TI  - Polymorphism in the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist gene is associated with 
      alcoholism in Spanish men.
PG  - 1479-82
AB  - BACKGROUND: A polymorphism located in intron 2 of the interleukin-1 receptor 
      antagonist (IL1RN) gene recently has been associated with the development of 
      hepatic fibrosis in Japanese alcoholics. In the present study, we analyzed 
      whether there is an association between this polymorphism, alcoholism, and 
      alcoholic liver disease in a Spanish male population of alcoholics. METHODS: The 
      IL1RN genotype was assessed by polymerase chain reaction by using 
      oligonucleotides that flank a variable nucleotide tandem repeat polymorphism 
      located in intron 2 of this gene in 90 male alcoholic patients from Spain: 30 
      alcohol-dependent men, 30 alcohol abusers, and 30 alcoholics with liver 
      cirrhosis. We also studied 40 healthy subjects. RESULTS: The distribution of the 
      IL1RN allelic frequencies in Spanish healthy subjects is similar to that 
      previously reported in White subjects. However, the A1 allele is overrepresented 
      in Spanish alcoholics when compared with healthy subjects. No significant 
      differences in allelic frequencies were observed between alcoholics with liver 
      cirrhosis and alcoholics without liver disease or between alcohol-dependent 
      subjects and alcohol abusers. CONCLUSION: The presence of the A1 allele of the 
      IL1RN gene is associated with a higher risk of alcoholism in Spanish men.

TI  - The rice Rim2 transcript accumulates in response to Magnaporthe grisea and its 
      predicted protein product shares similarity with TNP2-like proteins encoded by 
      CACTA transposons.
PG  - 2-10
AB  - A rice transcript, Rim2, was identified that accumulated in both incompatible and 
      compatible interactions between rice and Magnaporthe grisea. The Rim2 transcript 
      also accumulated in response to treatment with a cell wall elicitor derived from 
      M. grisea. A 3.3-kb RIM2 cDNA clone was isolated and is predicted to encode a 
      protein of 653 amino acids, which shares 32 55% identity with TNP2-like proteins 
      encoded by CACTA transposons of other plants. A 1.05-kb segment of the Rim2 
      sequence shows 82% nucleotide sequence identity with sequences flanking the A1 
      and C members of the rice Xa21 disease resistance gene family. The 5'-upstream 
      region of Rim2 was cloned and the transcriptional start sites were identified. 
      The 5' and 3' noncoding termini of Rim2 are AT-rich. A cis-element showing 
      similarity to a sequence that mediates defense-associated transcriptional 
      activation of the tobacco retrotransposon Tnt1, and four motifs that fit the 
      consensus sequence of the elicitor-responsive elements in the promoters of the 
      parsley PR-1 genes were found in the 5'-upstream region. Four imperfect tandem 
      repeats were identified in the 3' noncoding terminus. Southern analysis with 
      genomic DNA from different rice species indicated that Rim2 is present in 3-4 
      copies per genome. These results suggest that Rim2 may be one component of a 
      large CACTA-like element, whose transcript accumulates in response to attack by 
      pathogens.

TI  - Polymorphisms in the IL-1 receptor antagonist gene VNTR are possible risk factors 
      for juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies.
PG  - 47-52
AB  - Although HLA-DRB1 and -DQA1 alleles have been associated with adult and juvenile 
      idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (JIIM), they only partially account for the 
      genetic risk for these autoimmune disorders. Because IL-1alpha and IL-1beta, and 
      the anti-inflammatory competitive inhibitor, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), 
      have been implicated in the pathogenesis of myositis, we assessed the role of 
      variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphisms of the IL-1Ra gene (IL-1RN) in 
      the aetiology of JIIM: IL-1RN VNTR polymorphisms were performed on 250 JIIM 
      patients and 471 race-matched controls and were correlated with clinical 
      characteristics. The IL-1RN A1 allele, associated with increased proinflammatory 
      activity, was found to be a risk factor for Caucasians with JIIM (96.0% carriage 
      rate versus 90.2% in race-matched controls, Pcorr = 0.037, odds ratio (OR) = 2.5, 
      confidence interval (CI) = 1.1-5.8), but not for African-Americans, in whom the 
      A3 allele was a possible risk factor (7.0% versus 1.1% in race-matched controls, 
      Pcorr = 0.07, OR = 6.5, CI = 1.1-40.3). IL-1RN genotypes did not correlate with 
      circulating levels of IL-1Ra, which were higher in patients than in controls. The 
      polymorphic IL-1RN locus could be the first non-MHC genetic risk factor 
      identified for JIIM, and different alleles may confer susceptibility for 
      different ethnic groups.

AB  - The association between alcoholism and the Taq1 "A" and "B" polymorphic alleles 
      at the DRD2 gene and 48-bp tandem repeat in exon 3 of dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) 
      gene in 42 unrelated Slavic-surnamed patients and 76 normal controls was 
      examined. The frequency of the A1 allele was higher in alcoholic patients and in 
      alcoholic patients with a family history of alcoholism than in controls (chi(2)= 
      3.45, p < 0.001 and chi(2))= 3.97, p < 0.001, respectively). Moreover, the frequency 
      of the A1 allele was higher in alcoholics with a family history of alcoholism 
      than in alcoholics without a family history (chi(2)= 3.33, p < 0.001).The results of 
      association analysis for both the Taq1 "B" and DRD4 alleles were negative for 
      alcoholics in general, subgroups of alcoholics and normal controls. However, the 
      7-repeat allele (DRD4*7R) of DRD4 gene occurred at significantly higher frequency 
      in alcoholics with a family history of alcoholism compared with those without a 
      family history (chi(2)= 3.42, p < 0.01).The results indicate that the A1 allele of 
      the DRD2 gene is associated with susceptibility to alcoholism in general.The A1 
      allele, as well as the DRD4*7R allele, is significantly prevalent among 
      alcoholics with a family history, in comparison with alcoholics without a family 
      history, reflecting different roles of genetic factors in development of 
      alcoholism.

TI  - Comparison of two polymorphisms of the interleukin-1 gene family: interleukin-1 
      receptor antagonist polymorphism contributes to susceptibility to severe sepsis.
PG  - 1330-4
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the allele frequencies and genotype distribution 
      of an interleukin (IL)-1beta TaqI polymorphism and an interleukin-1 receptor 
      antagonist polymorphism are associated with susceptibility to and outcome of 
      severe sepsis. In addition, we analyze a possible linkage disequilibrium between 
      a previously described NcoI polymorphism within the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) 
      locus and the two IL-1 gene family polymorphisms. DESIGN: Prospective, 
      consecutive entry study of patients with diagnosis of severe sepsis. SETTING: 
      Intensive care unit (ICU) of a university hospital. PATIENTS: Ninety-three 
      patients with diagnosis of severe sepsis admitted to the ICU between June 1993 
      and June 1996. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The 
      polymorphic region within intron 2 of the IL-1ra gene containing variable numbers 
      of a tandem repeat of 86 base pairs was amplified by means of the polymerase 
      chain reaction. Alleles A1-5 are identified according to the size of the 
      amplified DNA product. The region that contains the biallelic TaqI site within 
      exon 5 of the IL-1beta gene was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction 
      amplification and subsequent digestion using the TaqI restriction enzyme. A NcoI 
      TNF-beta polymorphism was determined. The allele frequency of the allele IL-1raA2 
      was increased in 93 patients with severe sepsis compared with normal individuals 
      (p < .01). No association with patients' outcome was observed. Allele frequencies 
      or genotype distribution of the IL-1beta TaqI polymorphism did not differ between 
      patients and controls. In addition, the allele TNFB2 of the NcoI TNF-beta 
      polymorphism was associated with nonsurvival. Occurrence of the TNFB1 and TNFB2 
      alleles and genotypes was unrelated to alleles and genotypes of the two IL-1 gene 
      family polymorphisms. CONCLUSION: In contrast to the TNF-beta NcoI polymorphism, 
      which has been associated with patients' nonsurvival, the allele IL-1raA2 of the 
      polymorphism within the intron 2 of IL-1ra may contribute to susceptibility to 
      sepsis.

TI  - Genetic susceptibility associated with rare HRAS1 variable number of tandem 
      repeats alleles in Spanish non-small cell lung cancer patients.
PG  - 1849-54
AB  - The highly polymorphic HRAS1 variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR), which maps 
      1 kb downstream from the human H-ras1 gene, has been described as an inherited 
      predisposing factor in many human cancers. Here, we investigated the association 
      between the presence of rare HRAS1 minisatellite alleles and lung cancer in the 
      population studied. Four hundred sixty-six HRAS1 VNTR alleles from 233 lung 
      cancer patients and 892 alleles from 446 unaffected controls were typed using 
      PCR-long agarose gel electrophoresis assay of peripheral blood lymphocyte DNA. 
      Rare alleles were differentiated from common alleles (a1, a2, a3, and a4) by 
      shifts in electrophoretic mobility. Odds ratio was calculated to evaluate 
      increased risk of lung cancer associated to the presence of rare HRAS1 alleles. A 
      higher percentage of rare HRAS1 VNTR alleles in lung cancer patients than in 
      unaffected controls (32.7 versus 21.9%) was confirmed. The presence of rare 
      alleles was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer (odds ratio = 1.68; 
      P < or = 0.0001), indicating a genetic predisposition to lung cancer. No 
      differences based on other clinicopathological variables were observed. 
      Furthermore, a meta-analysis showed a higher distribution of rare alleles in our 
      study of Caucasian Spaniards than was found in other studies of American and 
      Northern European Caucasian populations. We conclude that the presence of rare 
      HRAS1 VNTR alleles may be an inherited predisposing factor in lung cancer. This 
      presence can be easily determined from peripheral blood samples by PCR-based 
      methods. Furthermore, interracial variations in allele frequencies and variations 
      between Caucasian subpopulations suggest that genetic variations may be involved 
      in susceptibility to lung oncogenesis, especially in certain ethnic populations.

TI  - Platelet GP IIIa PlA and GP Ib variable number tandem repeat polymorphisms and 
      markers of platelet activation in acute stroke.
PG  - 1124-31
AB  - A number of polymorphisms of the platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib-V-IX and IIb/IIIa 
      complexes have been described, and the PlA polymorphism of GP IIIa has been 
      associated with coronary thrombosis. We determined the levels of 
      beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG) and platelet factor 4 (PF4) and the genotype 
      distributions of PlA and a variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism of 
      GP 1b in subjects with acute stroke (n=609) and healthy control subjects (n=435). 
      Levels of beta-TG were higher in patients both initially (47.4 [44.7 to 50.2] 
      ng/mL, P<0.0001) and after 3 months (42.9 [40.3 to 45.7] ng/mL, P=0.03) compared 
      with control subjects (39.4 [37.7 to 41.2] ng/mL). Initial levels of beta-TG were 
      significantly higher in those who subsequently died (58.7 [52.3 to 65.8] ng/mL) 
      compared with those still alive (42.7 [40.1 to 45.5] ng/mL, P<0.0001). In a 
      logistic regression model, beta-TG remained an independent predictor of 
      poststroke mortality, with an odds ratio for an increase in 10 ng/mL of 1.12 
      (1.03 to 1.21, P=0.006). In subjects who had never smoked, there was a 
      significant difference in the genotype distributions of patients with 
      atherothrombotic stroke (A1/A1=147, A1/A2=70, and A2/A2=2) compared with controls 
      (A1/A1=165, A1/A2=47, and A2/A2=5, P=0.03). The PlA distribution of subjects with 
      atherothrombotic stroke before the age of 50 years (A1/A1=19 and A1/A2+A2/A2=18) 
      was also significantly different from age- and sex-matched controls (A1/A1=54 and 
      A1/A2+A2/A2=20, P=0.02). We found no association of VNTR with stroke or 
      poststroke mortality. These data indicate that there is a persistent state of 
      enhanced platelet activation in subjects with acute stroke, which is associated 
      with poststroke mortality. The increased frequency of the PlA2 allele in young 
      subjects with atherothrombotic stroke lends further support for a role of the PlA 
      polymorphism in acute thrombosis.

TI  - Twelve-nucleotide repeat polymorphism of D4 dopamine receptor gene in Chinese 
      familial schizophrenic patients.
PG  - 432-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Disturbances in dopaminergic transmission have been implicated in the 
      etiology of schizophrenia. Catalano et al reported an association between 
      delusional disorder and the number of a 12-nucleotide (bp) repeat sequence in the 
      first exon of dopamine D4 receptor gene (DRD4), which indicated a possible role 
      of this polymorphism in the pathogenesis of psychotic disorders. METHODS: DNA of 
      42 Chinese controls, 50 sporadic schizophrenic patients, and 30 familial 
      schizophrenic probands were collected. Genotype of the 12-bp repeat polymorphism 
      of DRD4 was determined with polymerase chain reaction and agarose gel 
      electrophoresis. Genotypic and allelic frequencies were compared among the three 
      groups using the chi-square test. RESULTS: Forty-three (86%) sporadic 
      schizophrenic patients, 25 (83.3%) familial schizophrenic probands, and 35 
      (83.3%) controls were A1 (two 12-bp repeat) homozygotes. One (2.0%) sporadic 
      schizophrenic and 1 familial schizophrenic patient were A2 (one 12-bp repeat) 
      homozygotes. There was no significant difference in allelic and genotypic 
      distributions among the three groups. CONCLUSIONS: The present data do not 
      support an association between schizophrenia and any specific allele of the 12-bp 
      repeat polymorphism of DRD4. Significance of familial/sporadic division of 
      schizophrenia cannot be supported regarding this repeat polymorphism.

TI  - In vivo and in vitro generation of a new altered HLA phenotype in 
      melanoma-tumour-cell variants expressing a single HLA-class-I allele.
PG  - 317-23
AB  - A new HLA-class-I altered phenotype is described in melanoma. This phenotype is 
      the result of a combination of HLA-B-locus down-regulation and HLA-haplotype 
      loss. The alteration was found in 2 melanoma cell lines generated from 2 
      patients; one was derived from an in vivo lesion (FM37) and the other was 
      obtained after in vitro immunoselection (R22.2). The R22.2 cell line was isolated 
      from FM55P, a cell line derived from a primary melanoma, after in vitro treatment 
      with a heterologous HLA-A2-restricted cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte (CTL) clone. Two 
      additional cell lines from patient 55 were obtained from 2 s.c. metastases 
      (FM55M1 and FM55M2). Iso-electric focusing and flow-cytometric studies showed a 
      significant reduction in the expression of both HLA-B alleles in all cell lines 
      studied. The expression of HLA-B-locus products recovered completely after 
      IFN-gamma treatment of FM55P, M1 and M2. In contrast, FM37 and R22.2 tumour cells 
      showed an additional HLA defect: the absence of one HLA haplotype. Simple 
      tandem-repeat polymorphism markers spanning chromosome 6 showed that DNA from the 
      2 samples (FM37 and R22.2) showed loss of heterozygosity (LOH). In both cases, 
      homozygosity was observed on 6p, which maps the HLA region, the final consequence 
      being a tumour cell that expressed a single HLA-class-I allele (HLA-A3 and HLA-A1 
      respectively). FM37 cells may thus reflect the in vivo counterpart of resistance 
      to lysis by HLA-A2-restricted tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes.

TI  - Identification of an HLA-A11-restricted epitope from the tandem repeat domain of 
      the epithelial tumor antigen mucin.
PG  - 4766-74
AB  - Epithelial cell mucin encoded by the MUC-1 gene is overexpressed and aberrantly 
      glycosylated on pancreatic, breast, and ovarian cancers as well as on multiple 
      myelomas. It is recognized by patients' Ab and by T cells derived from 
      tumor-draining lymph nodes. The T cell recognition is not MHC restricted and is 
      specific for an epitope previously localized to the immunodominant tandem repeat 
      region of the native mucin molecule. In search of possible MHC-restricted 
      epitopes in the same immunodominant region, we synthesized a panel of 
      overlapping, nine-amino acid long peptides spanning the MUC-1 tandem repeat and 
      first examined their binding to specific human MHC class I molecules using two 
      independent flow cytometry-based assay systems. This approach identified one 
      peptide, p9-17 (STAPPAHGV), that bound to HLA-A1, -A2.1, -A3, and -A11. 
      Measurements of the affinity of binding to each of these alleles, using a 
      quantitative molecular binding assay, indicated that only the relative binding 
      affinity to HLA-A11 was close to immunogenic values. We tested the immunogenicity 
      of p9-17 in vitro. We detected a secondary T cell response specific for p9-17 in 
      lymph nodes from an HLA-A11 breast cancer patient. Moreover, CTL specific for 
      p9-17 peptide could be generated from PBL in several healthy HLA-A11 donors by 
      primary in vitro stimulation.

TI  - Association of the prohormone convertase 2 gene (PCSK2) on chromosome 20 with 
      NIDDM in Japanese subjects.
PG  - 389-93
AB  - Proinsulin is converted to insulin by the concerted action of two 
      sequence-specific subtilisin-like proteases termed prohormone convertase 2 (PC2) 
      and prohormone convertase 3. PC2 is a type II proinsulin-processing enzyme, and 
      it cleaves the proinsulin molecule on the COOH-terminal side of dibasic peptide, 
      Lys64-Arg65, which joins the C-peptide and the A-chain domains. We have 
      previously cloned and characterized the exon-intron organization of the human PC2 
      gene (gene symbol PCSK2), localized this gene to human chromosome 20 band p11.2 
      by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and identified a simple tandem-repeat DNA 
      polymorphism (STRP) in intron 2 of the form (CA)n, suitable for genetic studies. 
      Since non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is associated with 
      increased secretion of proinsulin and proinsulin-like molecules, we conducted a 
      case-control study to determine whether a genetic variation in PCSK2 might 
      contribute to the development of NIDDM. The study population consisted of 152 
      Japanese NIDDM subjects and 102 normal healthy nondiabetic control subjects 
      matched for age and body mass index. The subjects were genotyped at the STRP in 
      intron 2, and the results indicated a significant difference (P = 0.004) in the 
      overall allele frequency distribution between the two groups. The A1 allele was 
      found more frequently in NIDDM than in nondiabetic subjects (11 vs. 4%, P = 
      0.0068). The NIDDM patients were divided into two subgroups according to the 
      presence or absence of the A1 allele.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Anderson's disease: no linkage to the apo B locus.
PG  - 257-64
AB  - We describe three patients with Anderson's disease who are members of one family; 
      the father and mother are close relatives and three of seven children show 
      symptoms of the disease. All patients suffered from diarrhea, failure to thrive, 
      and recurrent infections during infancy. Although these symptoms disappeared 
      later in life, biochemical disorders (such as low plasma levels of 
      apolipoproteins A1 and B and cholesterol, resulting in avitaminosis E, plus 
      failure to secrete chylomicrons after a fat meal) persisted. Electron microscopy 
      of enterocytes of one of the patients showed accumulation of lipid vacuoles with 
      no significant aberration of the Golgi apparatus itself. It is possible, 
      therefore, that the disease reflects a defect in chylomicron assembly. We found 
      that low levels of apolipoprotein (apo) B48 were present in the patients' plasma. 
      This suggests that the processing of the B100 message resulting in apo B48 
      functions normally. The possibility that a mutation in the apo B gene results in 
      an abnormal apo B48 protein is very unlikely since a variable number tandem 
      repeat (VNTR) polymorphism probe mapped to chromosome 2 failed to show 
      correspondence of the parent alleles with the disease. These observations confirm 
      the suggestion that Anderson's disease is not linked to the apo B locus.

TI  - Extended MHC haplotypes and CYP21/C4 gene organisation in Irish 21-hydroxylase 
      deficiency families.
PG  - 361-6
AB  - We have analysed fifteen classical 21-hydroxylase deficiency families from 
      throughout Southern Ireland and report the serologically defined HLA-A, HLA-B, 
      HLA-Cw, HLA-DR, C4A and C4B polymorphisms that characterize the inferred disease 
      haplotypes. Additionally, we have used a combination of short and long range 
      restriction mapping procedures in order to characterize the CYP21/C4 gene 
      organization associated with individual serologically defined haplotypes. The 
      results obtained indicate that disease haplotypes are characterized by a high 
      frequency (33%) of CYP21B gene deletion and 8 out of 10 such deletion haplotypes 
      are represented by the extended haplotype HLA-DR1, C4BQo, C4A3, HLA-B40(w60), 
      HLA-Cw3, HLA-A3. Large scale length polymorphism in the CYP21/C4 gene cluster was 
      found to conform strictly to a variable number of tandem repeats model with 4 
      alleles being detected. Disease haplotypes in which defective CYP21B gene 
      expression is inferred to result from pathological point mutations show extensive 
      diversity of associated HLA markers and include two examples of the extended HLA 
      haplotype HLA-DR3, B8, Cw7, A1 haplotype, which has previously been reported to 
      be negatively associated with 21-hydroxylase deficiency. One unusual disease 
      haplotype has two CYP21 + C4 units, both of which appear to contain CYP21B-like 
      genes.

TI  - Genesis by meiotic unequal crossover of a de novo deletion that contributes to 
      steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency.
PG  - 2107-11
AB  - The HLA-linked human steroid 21-hydroxylase gene CYP21B and its closely 
      homologous pseudogene CYP21A are each normally located centromeric to a fourth 
      component of complement (C4) gene, C4B and C4A, respectively, in an organization 
      suggesting tandem duplication of a ca. 30-kilobase DNA unit containing a CYP21 
      gene and a C4 gene. Such an organization has been considered to facilitate gene 
      deletion and addition events by unequal crossover between the tandem repeats. We 
      have identified a steroid 21-hydroxylase [steroid, hydrogen-donor:oxygen 
      oxidoreductase (21-hydroxylating), EC 1.14.99.10] deficiency patient who has a 
      maternally inherited disease haplotype that carries a de novo deletion of a ca. 
      30-kilobase repeat unit including the CYP21B gene and associated C4B gene. This 
      disease haplotype appears to have been generated as a result of meiotic unequal 
      crossover between maternal homologous chromosomes. One of the maternal haplotypes 
      is the frequently occurring HLA-DR3, B8, A1 haplotype that normally carries a 
      deletion of a ca. 30-kilobase unit including the CYP21A gene and C4A gene. 
      Haplotypes of this type may possibly act as premutations, increasing the 
      susceptibility of developing a 21-hydroxylase deficiency mutation by facilitating 
      unequal chromosome pairing.
