TI  - Clinical and genetic study of developmental and epileptic encephalopathy in 
      Argentinean pediatric patients.
PG  - 856-865
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to extend our knowledge of the genetic 
      background of Argentinean pediatric patients with developmental and epileptic 
      encephalopathy (DEE) applying a next generation sequencing (NGS) panel. METHODS: 
      Thirty one patients with DEE were studied, including these phenotypes: Dravet 
      syndrome (n:7), Dravet like syndrome (n:3), West syndrome (WS) (n:6), WS that 
      evolved to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) (n:4), epilepsy of infancy with 
      migrating focal seizures (n:2), continuous spikes and waves during slow sleep 
      evolving to LGS (n:1), LGS (n:1), myoclonic status in non-progressive 
      encephalopathy (n:1), myoclonic atonic epilepsy (n:1), epileptic encephalopathy 
      with multifocal spikes (n:1) and unclassified epileptic encephalopathy (n:4). 
      Fifty-two genes frequently associated with DEE were studied by NGS in genomic DNA 
      from peripheral blood. RESULTS: Relevant variants were detected in 12 cases; 6 
      novel pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants, 6 previously reported as 
      pathogenic and 1 variant of unknown significance. Single-nucleotide heterozygous 
      variants were identified in the SCN1A (5), GABRG2 (1), STXBP1 (2) genes, a mosaic 
      variant in SCN2A (1) and a homozygous variant in SCN1B (1). Additionally, a 
      heterozygous deletion involving the SCN1A, SCN2A and SCN3A genes (1), and the 
      most frequent triplet repeat expansion in the ARX gene (1) were detected. 
      DISCUSSION: Genetic diagnosis was made in 39% of patients. We emphasize the 
      importance of considering mosaic variants, copy number variants and hereditary 
      forms when designing and interpreting molecular studies, to optimize diagnosis 
      and management of patients. Approximately 42% of the detected variants were 
      novel, expanding the knowledge of the molecular basis of DEEs in Latin-American 
      patients.

TI  - Different types of disease-causing noncoding variants revealed by genomic and 
      gene expression analyses in families with X-linked intellectual disability.
PG  - 835-847
LID - 10.1002/humu.24207 [doi]
AB  - The pioneering discovery research of X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) 
      genes has benefitted thousands of individuals worldwide; however, approximately 
      30% of XLID families still remain unresolved. We postulated that noncoding 
      variants that affect gene regulation or splicing may account for the lack of a 
      genetic diagnosis in some cases. Detecting pathogenic, gene-regulatory variants 
      with the same sensitivity and specificity as structural and coding variants is a 
      major challenge for Mendelian disorders. Here, we describe three pedigrees with 
      suggestive XLID where distinctive phenotypes associated with known genes guided 
      the identification of three different noncoding variants. We used comprehensive 
      structural, single-nucleotide, and repeat expansion analyses of genome 
      sequencing. RNA-Seq from patient-derived cell lines, reverse-transcription 
      polymerase chain reactions, Western blots, and reporter gene assays were used to 
      confirm the functional effect of three fundamentally different classes of 
      pathogenic noncoding variants: a retrotransposon insertion, a novel intronic 
      splice donor, and a canonical splice variant of an untranslated exon. In one 
      family, we excluded a rare coding variant in ARX, a known XLID gene, in favor of 
      a regulatory noncoding variant in OFD1 that correlated with the clinical 
      phenotype. Our results underscore the value of genomic research on unresolved 
      XLID families to aid novel, pathogenic noncoding variant discovery.

TI  - Arx expansion mutation perturbs cortical development by augmenting apoptosis 
      without activating innate immunity in a mouse model of X-linked infantile spasms 
      syndrome.
LID - 10.1242/dmm.042515 [doi]
LID - dmm042515
AB  - X-linked infantile spasms syndrome (ISSX) is a clinically devastating 
      developmental epileptic encephalopathy with life-long impact. Arx((GCG)10+7) , a 
      mouse model of the most common triplet-repeat expansion mutation of ARX, exhibits 
      neonatal spasms, electrographic phenotypes and abnormal migration of GABAergic 
      interneuron subtypes. Neonatal presymptomatic treatment with 17beta-estradiol (E2) 
      in Arx((GCG)10+7) reduces spasms and modifies progression of epilepsy. Cortical 
      pathology during this period, a crucial point for clinical intervention in ISSX, 
      has largely been unexplored, and the pathogenic cellular defects that are 
      targeted by early interventions are unknown. In the first postnatal week, we 
      identified a transient wave of elevated apoptosis in Arx((GCG)10+7) mouse cortex 
      that is non-Arx cell autonomous, since mutant Arx-immunoreactive (Arx(+)) cells 
      are not preferentially impacted by cell death. NeuN(+) (also known as Rbfox3) 
      survival was also not impacted, suggesting a vulnerable subpopulation in the 
      immature Arx((GCG)10+7) cortex. Inflammatory processes during this period might 
      explain this transient elevation in apoptosis; however, transcriptomic and 
      immunohistochemical profiling of several markers of inflammation revealed no 
      innate immune activation in Arx((GCG)10+7) cortex. Neither neonatal E2 hormone 
      therapy, nor ACTH(1-24), the frontline clinical therapy for ISSX, diminished the 
      augmented apoptosis in Arx((GCG)10+7) , but both rescued neocortical Arx(+) cell 
      density. Since early E2 treatment effectively prevents seizures in this model, 
      enhanced apoptosis does not solely account for the seizure phenotype, but may 
      contribute to other aberrant brain function in ISSX. However, since both hormone 
      therapies, E2 and ACTH(1-24), elevate the density of cortical 
      Arx(+)-interneurons, their early therapeutic role in other neurological disorders 
      hallmarked by interneuronopathy should be explored.This article has an associated 
      First Person interview with the first author of the paper.

TI  - A triplet repeat expansion genetic mouse model of infantile spasms syndrome, 
      Arx(GCG)10+7, with interneuronopathy, spasms in infancy, persistent seizures, and 
      adult cognitive and behavioral impairment.
PG  - 8752-63
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0915-09.2009 [doi]
AB  - Infantile spasms syndrome (ISS) is a catastrophic pediatric epilepsy with motor 
      spasms, persistent seizures, mental retardation, and in some cases, autism. One 
      of its monogenic causes is an insertion mutation [c.304ins (GCG)(7)] on the X 
      chromosome, expanding the first polyalanine tract of the interneuron-specific 
      transcription factor Aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) from 16 to 23 alanine 
      codons. Null mutation of the Arx gene impairs GABA and cholinergic interneuronal 
      migration but results in a neonatal lethal phenotype. We developed the first 
      viable genetic mouse model of ISS that spontaneously recapitulates salient 
      phenotypic features of the human triplet repeat expansion mutation. 
      Arx((GCG)10+7) ("Arx plus 7") pups display abnormal spasm-like myoclonus and 
      other key EEG features, including multifocal spikes, electrodecremental episodes, 
      and spontaneous seizures persisting into maturity. The neurobehavioral profile of 
      Arx mutants was remarkable for lowered anxiety, impaired associative learning, 
      and abnormal social interaction. Laminar decreases of Arx+ cortical interneurons 
      and a selective reduction of calbindin-, but not parvalbumin- or 
      calretinin-expressing interneurons in neocortical layers and hippocampus indicate 
      that specific classes of synaptic inhibition are missing from the adult 
      forebrain, providing a basis for the seizures and cognitive disorder. A 
      significant reduction of calbindin-, NPY (neuropeptide Y)-expressing, and 
      cholinergic interneurons in the mutant striatum suggest that dysinhibition within 
      this network may contribute to the dyskinetic motor spasms. This mouse model 
      narrows the range of critical pathogenic elements within brain inhibitory 
      networks essential to recreate this complex neurodevelopmental syndrome.
