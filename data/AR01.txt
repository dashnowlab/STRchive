AB  - The monkeypox virus (MPXV) has triggered a current outbreak globally. Genome 
      sequencing of MPXV and rapid tracing of genetic variants will benefit disease 
      diagnosis and control. It is a significant challenge but necessary to optimize 
      the strategy and application of rapid full-length genome identification and to 
      track variations of MPXV in clinical specimens with low viral loads, as it is one 
      of the DNA viruses with the largest genome and the most AT-biased, and has a 
      significant number of tandem repeats. Here we evaluated the performance of 
      metagenomic and amplicon sequencing techniques, and three sequencing platforms in 
      MPXV genome sequencing based on multiple clinical specimens of five mpox cases in 
      Chinese mainland. We rapidly identified the full-length genome of MPXV with the 
      assembly of accurate tandem repeats in multiple clinical specimens. Amplicon 
      sequencing enables cost-effective and rapid sequencing of clinical specimens to 
      obtain high-quality MPXV genomes. Third-generation sequencing facilitates the 
      assembly of the terminal tandem repeat regions in the monkeypox virus genome and 
      corrects a common misassembly in published sequences. Besides, several intra-host 
      single nucleotide variations were identified in the first imported mpox case. 
      This study offers an evaluation of various strategies aimed at identifying the 
      complete genome of MPXV in clinical specimens. The findings of this study will 
      significantly enhance the surveillance of MPXV.

AB  - A middle age man complained of progressive bilateral hand tremor and occasional 
      muscle cramps. Examination showed tongue muscle atrophy and limb muscle 
      fasciculation with resting and postural tremor in the upper extremities. Deep 
      tendon reflexes were decreased. He had bilateral breast enlargement. Nerve 
      conduction study and Electromyography revealed chronic sensory-motor neuropathy. 
      DNA analysis identified an expanded number of CAG trinucleotide repeats in the 
      androgen receptor gene consistent with a diagnosis of Kennedy's disease (KD). KD, 
      also known as Spinal Bulbar Muscular Atrophy (SBMA), is a rare X-linked recessive 
      lower motor neuron disorder characterized by proximal and bulbar muscle wasting 
      due to degeneration of motor neurons in the brain stem and spinal cord. KD can 
      present with non-specific symptoms initially and may be misdiagnosed as 
      Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or other neurological conditions. Molecular genetic 
      testing enables the diagnosis by identifying the CAG trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion.

AB  - The recommended practice for individuals suspected of a genetic etiology for 
      disorders including unexplained developmental delay/intellectual disability 
      (DD/ID), autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and multiple congenital anomalies (MCA) 
      involves a genetic testing workflow including chromosomal microarray (CMA), 
      Fragile-X testing, karyotype analysis, and/or sequencing-based gene panels. Since 
      genomic imbalances are often found to be causative, CMA is recommended as first 
      tier testing for many indications. Optical genome mapping (OGM) is an emerging 
      next generation cytogenomic technique that can detect not only copy number 
      variants (CNVs), triploidy and absence of heterozygosity (AOH) like CMA, but can 
      also define the location of duplications, and detect other structural variants 
      (SVs), including balanced rearrangements and repeat expansions/contractions. This 
      study compares OGM to CMA for clinically reported genomic variants, some of these 
      samples also have structural characterization by fluorescence in situ 
      hybridization (FISH). OGM was performed on IRB approved, de-identified specimens 
      from 55 individuals with genomic abnormalities previously identified by CMA (61 
      clinically reported abnormalities). SVs identified by OGM were filtered by a 
      control database to remove polymorphic variants and against an established gene 
      list to prioritize clinically relevant findings before comparing with CMA and 
      FISH results. OGM results showed 100% concordance with CMA findings for 
      pathogenic variants and 98% concordant for all pathogenic/likely 
      pathogenic/variants of uncertain significance (VUS), while also providing 
      additional insight into the genomic structure of abnormalities that CMA was 
      unable to provide. OGM demonstrates equivalent performance to CMA for CNV and AOH 
      detection, enhanced by its ability to determine the structure of the genome. This 
      work adds to an increasing body of evidence on the analytical validity and 
      ability to detect clinically relevant abnormalities identified by CMA. Moreover, 
      OGM identifies translocations, structures of duplications and complex CNVs 
      intractable by CMA, yielding additional clinical utility.

TI  - Msi2 enhances muscle dysfunction in a myotonic dystrophy type 1 mouse model.

LID - S2319-4170(23)00104-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.bj.2023.100667 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a rare neuromuscular disease 
      caused by a CTG repeat expansion in the 3' untranslated region of the DM1 protein 
      kinase gene. Characteristic degenerative muscle symptoms include myotonia, 
      atrophy, and weakness. We previously proposed an MSI2>miR-7>autophagy axis 
      whereby MSI2 overexpression repressed miR-7 biogenesis that subsequently 
      de-repressed muscle catabolism through excessive autophagy. Because the DM1 
      HSA(LR) mouse model expressing expanded CUG repeats shows weak muscle-wasting 
      phenotypes, we hypothesized that MSI2 overexpression was sufficient to promote 
      muscle dysfunction in vivo. METHODS: By means of recombinant AAV murine Msi2 was 
      overexpressed in neonates HSA(LR) mice skeletal muscle to induce DM1-like 
      phenotypes RESULTS: Sustained overexpression of the murine Msi2 protein in 
      HSA(LR) neonates induced autophagic flux and expression of critical autophagy 
      proteins, increased central nuclei and reduced myofibers area, and weakened 
      muscle strength. Importantly, these changes were independent of Mbnl1, Mbnl2, and 
      Celf1 protein levels, which remained unchanged upon Msi2 overexpression. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Globally, molecular, histological, and functional data from these 
      experiments in the HSA(LR) mouse model confirms the pathological role of Msi2 
      expression levels as an atrophy-associated component that impacts the 
      characteristic muscle dysfunction symptoms in DM1 patients.

TI  - Cochlear Nucleus Transcriptome of a Fragile X Mouse Model Reveals Candidate Genes 
      for Hyperacusis.
LID - 10.1002/lary.30936 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a hereditary form of autism spectrum 
      disorder. It is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the Fmr1 gene, 
      leading to a loss of Fragile X Protein (FMRP) expression. The loss of FMRP causes 
      auditory hypersensitivity: FXS patients display hyperacusis and the Fmr1- 
      knock-out (KO) mouse model for FXS exhibits auditory seizures. FMRP is strongly 
      expressed in the cochlear nucleus and other auditory brainstem nuclei. We 
      hypothesize that the Fmr1-KO mouse has altered gene expression in the cochlear 
      nucleus that may contribute to auditory hypersensitivity. METHODS: RNA was 
      isolated from cochlear nuclei of Fmr1-KO and WT mice. Using next-generation 
      sequencing (RNA-seq), the transcriptomes of Fmr1-KO mice and WT mice (n = 3 each) 
      were compared and analyzed using gene ontology programs. RESULTS: We identified 
      270 unique, differentially expressed genes between Fmr1-KO and WT cochlear 
      nuclei. Upregulated genes (67%) are enriched in those encoding secreted 
      molecules. Downregulated genes (33%) are enriched in neuronal function, including 
      synaptic pathways, some of which are ideal candidate genes that may contribute to 
      hyperacusis. CONCLUSION: The loss of FMRP can affect the expression of genes in 
      the cochlear nucleus that are important for neuronal signaling. One of these, 
      Kcnab2, which encodes a subunit of the Shaker voltage-gated potassium channel, is 
      expressed at an abnormally low level in the Fmr1-KO cochlear nucleus. Kcnab2 and 
      other differentially expressed genes may represent pathways for the development 
      of hyperacusis. Future studies will be aimed at investigating the effects of 
      these altered genes on hyperacusis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level N/A Laryngoscope, 
      2023.

TI  - X-linked SBMA model mice display relevant non-neurological phenotypes and their 
      expression of mutant androgen receptor protein in motor neurons is not required 
      for neuromuscular disease.

AB  - X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA; Kennedy's disease) is a rare 
      neuromuscular disorder characterized by adult-onset proximal muscle weakness and 
      lower motor neuron degeneration. SBMA was the first human disease found to be 
      caused by a repeat expansion mutation, as affected patients possess an expanded 
      tract of CAG repeats, encoding polyglutamine, in the androgen receptor (AR) gene. 
      We previously developed a conditional BAC fxAR121 transgenic mouse model of SBMA 
      and used it to define a primary role for skeletal muscle expression of 
      polyglutamine-expanded AR in causing the motor neuron degeneration. Here we 
      sought to extend our understanding of SBMA disease pathophysiology and cellular 
      basis by detailed examination and directed experimentation with the BAC fxAR121 
      mice. First, we evaluated BAC fxAR121 mice for non-neurological disease 
      phenotypes recently described in human SBMA patients, and documented prominent 
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, cardiomegaly, and ventricular heart wall 
      thinning in aged male BAC fxAR121 mice. Our discovery of significant hepatic and 
      cardiac abnormalities in SBMA mice underscores the need to evaluate human SBMA 
      patients for signs of liver and heart disease. To directly examine the 
      contribution of motor neuron-expressed polyQ-AR protein to SBMA 
      neurodegeneration, we crossed BAC fxAR121 mice with two different lines of 
      transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase in motor neurons, and after updating 
      characterization of SBMA phenotypes in our current BAC fxAR121 colony, we found 
      that excision of mutant AR from motor neurons did not rescue neuromuscular or 
      systemic disease. These findings further validate a primary role for skeletal 
      muscle as the driver of SBMA motor neuronopathy and indicate that therapies being 
      developed to treat patients should be delivered peripherally.

TI  - Differential expression of the androgen receptor gene is correlated with CAG 
      polymorphic repeats in patients with prostate cancer.
LID - 23 [pii]
AB  - Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common types of cancer in men. The 
      aetiology of the disease is not well established, but it has been related to one 
      of the main pathways of regulation of prostate proliferation, mediated by 
      androgens. The androgen receptor (AR) gene encodes the androgen-receptor protein, 
      which functions as a transactivation factor for steroid hormones. It has been 
      proposed that the AR gene transcription levels are mediated by short tandem 
      repeats corresponding to the CAG sequence. However, there are conflicting results 
      in this relationship. We evaluated the expression levels of the AR gene and 
      identified the number of CAG repeats (CAG(n)) in the Mexican population, 
      establishing the relationship between expression levels and increase in the 
      number of CAG repeats. We evaluated the expression levels of AR in tissue samples 
      of PCa and benign prostate disease, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia, or 
      prostatitis, to determine the difference in their expression levels. Our results 
      showed a statistically insignificant underexpression of 0.64-fold decrease in AR 
      levels of PCa patients compared to benign prostate disease patients (P = 0.623) 
      and suggest that the number of CAGn was correlated with the relative expression 
      of the AR gene (P = 0.009) and this correlation was positive, moderate, and 
      proportional (rho = 0.467) and no correlation was found between CAG(n) with other 
      clinical features.

TI  - Unexpected frequency of the pathogenic AR CAG repeat expansion in the general 
      population.
PG  - 2723-2729
LID - 10.1093/brain/awad050 [doi]
AB  - CAG repeat expansions in exon 1 of the AR gene on the X chromosome cause spinal 
      and bulbar muscular atrophy, a male-specific progressive neuromuscular disorder 
      associated with a variety of extra-neurological symptoms. The disease has a 
      reported male prevalence of approximately 1:30 000 or less, but the AR repeat 
      expansion frequency is unknown. We established a pipeline, which combines the use 
      of the ExpansionHunter tool and visual validation, to detect AR CAG expansion on 
      whole-genome sequencing data, benchmarked it to fragment PCR sizing, and applied 
      it to 74 277 unrelated individuals from four large cohorts. Our pipeline showed 
      sensitivity of 100% [95% confidence interval (CI) 90.8-100%], specificity of 99% 
      (95% CI 94.2-99.7%), and a positive predictive value of 97.4% (95% CI 
      84.4-99.6%). We found the mutation frequency to be 1:3182 (95% CI 1:2309-1:4386, 
      n = 117 734) X chromosomes-10 times more frequent than the reported disease 
      prevalence. Modelling using the novel mutation frequency led to estimate disease 
      prevalence of 1:6887 males, more than four times more frequent than the reported 
      disease prevalence. This discrepancy is possibly due to underdiagnosis of this 
      neuromuscular condition, reduced penetrance, and/or pleomorphic clinical 
      manifestations.

TI  - Bicalutamide and Trehalose Ameliorate Spinal and Bulbar Muscular Atrophy 
      Pathology in Mice.
PG  - 524-545
LID - 10.1007/s13311-023-01343-x [doi]
AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is characterized by motor neuron (MN) 
      degeneration that leads to slowly progressive muscle weakness. It is considered a 
      neuromuscular disease since muscle has a primary role in disease onset and 
      progression. SBMA is caused by a CAG triplet repeat expansion in the androgen 
      receptor (AR) gene. The translated poly-glutamine (polyQ) tract confers a toxic 
      gain of function to the mutant AR altering its folding, causing its aggregation 
      into intracellular inclusions, and impairing the autophagic flux. In an in vitro 
      SBMA neuronal model, we previously showed that the antiandrogen bicalutamide and 
      trehalose, a natural disaccharide stimulating autophagy, block ARpolyQ 
      activation, reduce its nuclear translocation and toxicity and facilitate the 
      autophagic degradation of cytoplasmic AR aggregates. Here, in a knock-in SBMA 
      mouse model (KI AR113Q), we show that bicalutamide and trehalose ameliorated SBMA 
      pathology. Bicalutamide reversed the formation of the AR insoluble forms in KI 
      AR113Q muscle, preventing autophagic flux blockage. We demonstrated that 
      apoptosis is activated in KI AR113Q muscle, and that both compounds prevented its 
      activation. We detected a decrease of mtDNA and an increase of OXPHOS enzymes, 
      already at early symptomatic stages; these alterations were reverted by 
      trehalose. Overall, bicalutamide and/or trehalose led to a partial recovery of 
      muscle morphology and function, and improved SBMA mouse motor behavior, inducing 
      an extension of their survival. Thus, bicalutamide and trehalose, by 
      counteracting ARpolyQ toxicity in skeletal muscle, are valuable candidates for 
      future clinical trials in SBMA patients.

AB  - Short Tandem Repeats (STRs) have been found to play a role in a myriad of complex 
      traits and genetic diseases. We examined the variability in the lengths of over 
      850,000 STR loci in 996 children with suspected genetic disorders and 1,178 
      parents across six separate ancestral groups: Africans, Europeans, East Asians, 
      Admixed Americans, Non-admixed Americans, and Pacific Islanders. For each STR 
      locus we compared allele length between and within each ancestry group. In 
      relation to Europeans, admixed Americans had the most similar STR lengths with 
      only 623 positions either significantly expanded or contracted, while the 
      divergence was highest in Africans, with 4,933 chromosomal positions contracted 
      or expanded. We also examined probands to identify STR expansions at known 
      pathogenic loci. The genes TCF4, AR, and DMPK showed significant expansions with 
      lengths 250% greater than their various average allele lengths in 49, 162, and 11 
      individuals respectively. All 49 individuals containing an expansion in TCF4 and 
      six individuals containing an expansion in DMPK presented with allele lengths 
      longer than the known pathogenic length for these genes. Next, we identified 
      individuals with significant expansions in highly conserved loci across all 
      ancestries. Eighty loci in conserved regions met criteria for divergence. Two of 
      these individuals were found to have exonic STR expansions: one in ZBTB4 and the 
      other in SLC9A7, which is associated with X-linked mental retardation. Finally, 
      we used parent-child trios to detect and analyze de novo mutations. In total, we 
      observed 3,219 de novo expansions, where proband allele lengths are greater than 
      twice the longest parental allele length. This work helps lay the foundation for 
      understanding STR lengths genome-wide across ancestries and may help identify new 
      disease genes and novel mechanisms of pathogenicity in known disease genes.

TI  - Fast and reliable detection of repeat expansions in spinocerebellar ataxia using 
      exomes.

AB  - Usually, molecular diagnosis of spinocerebellar ataxia is based on a step-by-step 
      approach with targeted sizing of four repeat expansions accounting for most 
      dominant cases, then targeted sequencing of other genes. Nowadays, genome 
      sequencing allows detection of most pathogenic variants in a single step. The 
      ExpansionHunter tool can detect expansions in short-read genome sequencing data. 
      Recent studies have shown that ExpansionHunter can also be used to identify 
      repeat expansions in exome sequencing data. We tested ExpansionHunter on 
      spinocerebellar ataxia exomes in a research context as a second-line analysis, 
      after exclusion of main CAG repeat expansions in half of the probands. First, we 
      confirmed the detection of expansions in seven known expansion carriers and then, 
      after targeted analysis of ATXN1, 2, 3 and 7, CACNA1A, TBP, ATN1, NOP56, AR and 
      HTT in 498 exomes, we found 22 additional pathogenic expansions. Comparison with 
      capillary migration sizing in 247 individuals and confirmation of all expanded 
      alleles detected by ExpansionHunter demonstrated that for these loci, sensitivity 
      and specificity reached 100%. ExpansionHunter detected but underestimated the 
      repeat size for larger expansions, and the normal alleles distribution at each 
      locus should be taken into account to detect expansions. Exome combined with 
      ExpansionHunter is reliable to detect repeat expansions in selected loci as 
      first-line analysis in spinocerebellar ataxia.

TI  - Deep Intronic FGF14 GAA Repeat Expansion in Late-Onset Cerebellar Ataxia.
PG  - 128-141
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa2207406 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The late-onset cerebellar ataxias (LOCAs) have largely resisted 
      molecular diagnosis. METHODS: We sequenced the genomes of six persons with 
      autosomal dominant LOCA who were members of three French Canadian families and 
      identified a candidate pathogenic repeat expansion. We then tested for 
      association between the repeat expansion and disease in two independent 
      case-control series - one French Canadian (66 patients and 209 controls) and the 
      other German (228 patients and 199 controls). We also genotyped the repeat in 20 
      Australian and 31 Indian index patients. We assayed gene and protein expression 
      in two postmortem cerebellum specimens and two induced pluripotent stem-cell 
      (iPSC)-derived motor-neuron cell lines. RESULTS: In the six French Canadian 
      patients, we identified a GAA repeat expansion deep in the first intron of FGF14, 
      which encodes fibroblast growth factor 14. Cosegregation of the repeat expansion 
      with disease in the families supported a pathogenic threshold of at least 250 GAA 
      repeats ([GAA](>/=250)). There was significant association between FGF14 
      (GAA)(>/=250) expansions and LOCA in the French Canadian series (odds ratio, 
      105.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 31.09 to 334.20; P<0.001) and in the German 
      series (odds ratio, 8.76; 95% CI, 3.45 to 20.84; P<0.001). The repeat expansion 
      was present in 61%, 18%, 15%, and 10% of French Canadian, German, Australian, and 
      Indian index patients, respectively. In total, we identified 128 patients with 
      LOCA who carried an FGF14 (GAA)(>/=250) expansion. Postmortem cerebellum specimens 
      and iPSC-derived motor neurons from patients showed reduced expression of FGF14 
      RNA and protein. CONCLUSIONS: A dominantly inherited deep intronic GAA repeat 
      expansion in FGF14 was found to be associated with LOCA. (Funded by Fondation

LID - 10.1021/jacs.2c08883 [doi]
AB  - A solid-phase DNA-encoded library (DEL) was studied for binding the RNA repeat 
      expansion r(CUG)(exp), the causative agent of the most common form of adult-onset 
      muscular dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). A variety of uncharged and 
      novel RNA binders were identified to selectively bind r(CUG)(exp) by using a 
      two-color flow cytometry screen. The cellular activity of one binder was 
      augmented by attaching it with a module that directly cleaves r(CUG)(exp). In DM1 
      patient-derived muscle cells, the compound specifically bound r(CUG)(exp) and 
      allele-specifically eliminated r(CUG)(exp), improving disease-associated defects. 
      The approaches herein can be used to identify and optimize ligands and bind RNA 
      that can be further augmented for functionality including degradation.

TI  - Reliable virtual clinical assessment in spino-bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA).
PG  - 161
LID - 10.1136/jnnp-2022-329616 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spino-bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), caused by a CAG repeat 
      expansion in the androgen receptor gene, affects adult men and results in muscle 
      atrophy and weakness in the bulbar and limb muscles and signs of partial androgen 
      insensitivity. During the COVID-19 pandemic, outpatients' visits have been 
      reduced to preserve safety of frail patients, and telehealth was largely 
      employed. METHODS: From April to November 2020, we monitored 12 patients with 
      SBMA with telehealth and administered remotely two clinical scales currently used 
      for SBMA: Adult Myopathy Assessment Tool (AMAT) and SBMA-Functional Rating Scale 
      (SBMA-FRS). We compared results with previous and subsequent in-person visits' 
      scores, and assessed the longitudinal changes in AMAT and SBMA-FRS scores during 
      7 years through the repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: 
      Repeated measures ANOVA of AMAT scores collected during 7 years and including 
      tele-AMAT evaluation showed a steady mean decline of 1-2 points per year. A 
      similar trend of SBMA-FRS scores, with a mean decline per year of about 1 point, 
      was observed. There was no relevant deviation from the model prediction. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that telehealth is a valid tool to monitor patients 
      with SBMA: AMAT and SBMA-FRS scales can be effectively, reliably and easily 
      administered remotely.

TI  - Huntington's disease age at motor onset is modified by the tandem hexamer repeat 
      in TCERG1.
PG  - 53
LID - 10.1038/s41525-022-00317-w [doi]
LID - 53
AB  - Huntington's disease is caused by an expanded CAG tract in HTT. The length of the 
      CAG tract accounts for over half the variance in age at onset of disease, and is 
      influenced by other genetic factors, mostly implicating the DNA maintenance 
      machinery. We examined a single nucleotide variant, rs79727797, on chromosome 5 
      in the TCERG1 gene, previously reported to be associated with Huntington's 
      disease and a quasi-tandem repeat (QTR) hexamer in exon 4 of TCERG1 with a 
      central pure repeat. We developed a method for calling perfect and imperfect 
      repeats from exome-sequencing data, and tested association between the QTR in 
      TCERG1 and residual age at motor onset (after correcting for the effects of CAG 
      length in the HTT gene) in 610 individuals with Huntington's disease via 
      regression analysis. We found a significant association between age at onset and 
      the sum of the repeat lengths from both alleles of the QTR (p = 2.1 x 10(-9)), 
      with each added repeat hexamer reducing age at onset by one year (95% confidence 
      interval [0.7, 1.4]). This association explained that previously observed with 
      rs79727797. The association with age at onset in the genome-wide association 
      study is due to a QTR hexamer in TCERG1, translated to a glutamine/alanine tract 
      in the protein. We could not distinguish whether this was due to cis-effects of 
      the hexamer repeat on gene expression or of the encoded glutamine/alanine tract 
      in the protein. These results motivate further study of the mechanisms by which 
      TCERG1 modifies onset of HD.

TI  - The relationship between common mutations in CFTR, AR genes, Y chromosome 
      microdeletions and karyotyping abnormalities with very severe oligozoospermia in 
      Iranian men.
PG  - 519-529
LID - 10.1007/s13258-022-01300-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Male infertility due to very severe oligozoospermia has been 
      associated with some genetic risk factors. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the 
      distribution of the mutations in the CFTR gene, the CAG-repeat expansion of the 
      AR gene, also Y chromosome microdeletions and karyotyping abnormalities in very 
      severe oligozoospermia patients. METHODS: In the present case-control study, 200 
      patients and 200 fertile males were enrolled. All patients and control group were 
      karyotyped. Microdeletions were evaluated using multiplex PCR. Five common CFTR 
      mutations were genotyped using the ARMS-PCR technique. The CAG-repeat expansion 
      in the AR gene was evaluated for each individual using sequencing. RESULTS: 
      Overall 4% of cases shows a numerical and structural abnormality. 7.5% of 
      patients had a deletion in one of the AZF regions on Yq, and 3.5% had a deletion 
      in two regions. F508del was the most common (4.5%) CFTR gene mutation; G542X, and 
      W1282X were detected with 1.5% and 1% respectively. One patient was found to have 
      AZFa microdeletion and F508del in heterozygote form; one patient had AZFb 
      microdeletion with F508del. F508del was seen as compound heterozygous with G542X 
      in one patient and with W1282X in the other patient. The difference in the mean 
      of the CAG-repeats in the AR gene in patients and control groups was 
      statistically significant (P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Our study shows the genetic 
      mutations in men with severe oligozoospermia and given the possibility of 
      transmission of these disorders to the next generation by fertilization, 
      counseling and genetic testing are suggested for these couples before considering 
      ICSI.

      bulbar muscular atrophy.
PG  - 278-294
LID - 10.1093/brain/awac269 [doi]
AB  - Spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), the first identified CAG-repeat expansion 
      disorder, is an X-linked neuromuscular disorder involving CAG-repeat-expansion 
      mutations in the androgen receptor (AR) gene. We utilized CRISPR-Cas9 gene 
      editing to engineer novel isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) 
      models, consisting of isogenic AR knockout, control and disease lines expressing 
      mutant AR with distinct repeat lengths, as well as control and disease lines 
      expressing FLAG-tagged wild-type and mutant AR, respectively. Adapting a 
      small-molecule cocktail-directed approach, we differentiate the isogenic hiPSC 
      models into motor neuron-like cells with a highly enriched population to uncover 
      cell-type-specific mechanisms underlying SBMA and to distinguish gain- from 
      loss-of-function properties of mutant AR in disease motor neurons. We demonstrate 
      that ligand-free mutant AR causes drastic mitochondrial dysfunction in neurites 
      of differentiated disease motor neurons due to gain-of-function mechanisms and 
      such cytotoxicity can be amplified upon ligand (androgens) treatment. We further 
      show that aberrant interaction between ligand-free, mitochondria-localized mutant 
      AR and F-ATP synthase is associated with compromised mitochondrial respiration 
      and multiple other mitochondrial impairments. These findings counter the 
      established notion that androgens are requisite for mutant AR-induced 
      cytotoxicity in SBMA, reveal a compelling mechanistic link between ligand-free 
      mutant AR, F-ATP synthase and mitochondrial dysfunction, and provide innovative 
      insights into motor neuron-specific therapeutic interventions for SBMA.

TI  - C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion found in suspected spinobulbar muscular 
      atrophy (SBMA).
PG  - 276-280

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The expansion of a hexanucleotide GGGGCC repeat (G4C2) in the 
      C9orf72 locus is the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
      (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In addition, C9orf72 expansion has also 
      been detected in patients with a clinical manifestation of Parkinson's Disease 
      (PD), Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Huntington's Disease (HD), and ataxic disorders. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 1,387 patients with clinically suspected ALS, HD 
      or spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) were enrolled, and the prevalence of 
      C9orf72 expansions was estimated. RESULTS: The hexanucleotide expansion accounted 
      for 3.7% of the ALS patients, 0.2% of the HD suspected patients with excluded HTT 
      mutation, and 1.3% of the suspected SBMA patients with excluded mutation in AR 
      gene. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report revealing the presence of C9orf72 
      expansion in patients with a suspected SBMA diagnosis. Consequently, we advise 
      testing for C9orf72 expansion in patients presenting with the SBMA phenotype and 
      a genetically unsolved diagnosis.

TI  - The Clinical and Polynucleotide Repeat Expansion Analysis of ATXN2, NOP56, AR and 
      C9orf72 in Patients With ALS From Mainland China.
PG  - 811202
LID - 10.3389/fneur.2022.811202 [doi]
LID - 811202
AB  - BACKGROUND: Repeat expansions, including those in C9orf72 and ATXN2, have been 
      implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, there have been few 
      studies on the association of AR and NOP56 repeat expansion with ALS, especially 
      in China. Accordingly, we aimed to evaluate the frequency of C9orf72 and ATXN2 
      repeat mutations and investigate whether NOP56 and AR repeat expansion are risk 
      factors for ALS. METHODS: In this study, 736 ALS patients and several hundred 
      healthy controls were recruited. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 
      repeat-primed PCR (RP-PCR) were performed to determine the repeat lengths in 
      C9orf72, ATXN2, AR, and NOP56. RESULTS: GGGGCC repeats in C9orf72 were observed 
      in six ALS patients (0.8%, 6/736) but not in any of the controls (0/365). The 
      patients with pathogenic GGGGCC repeats showed shorter median survival times than 
      those with a normal genotype (p = 0.006). Regarding ATXN2 CAG repeats, we 
      identified that intermediate repeat lengths (29-34 copies) were associated with 
      ALS (p = 0.033), and there was no difference in clinical characteristics between 
      the groups with and without intermediate repeats (p > 0.05). Meanwhile, we 
      observed that there was no association between the repeat size in AR and NOP56 
      and ALS (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that pathogenetic 
      repeats in C9orf72 are rare in China, while intermediate CAG repeats in ATXN2 are 
      more frequent but have no effect on disease phenotypes; the repeat size in AR and 
      NOP56 may not be a risk factor for ALS.

TI  - A Selective Alkylating Agent for CTG Repeats in Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1.

AB  - Disease intervention at the DNA level generally has been avoided because of 
      off-target effects. Recent advances in genome editing technologies using 
      CRISPR-Cas9 have opened a new era in DNA-targeted therapeutic approaches. 
      However, delivery of such systems remains a major challenge. Here, we report a 
      selective DNA-modifying small molecule that targets a disease-specific structure 
      and mismatches involved in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). This ligand alkylates 
      T-T mismatch-containing hairpins formed in the expanded CTG repeats (d(CTG)(exp)) 
      in DM1. Ligand alkylation of d(CTG)(exp) inhibits the transcription of 
      d(CAG.CTG)(exp), thereby reducing the level of the toxic r(CUG)(exp) transcript. 
      The bioactivity of the ligand also included a reduction in DM1 pathological 
      features such as disease foci formation and misregulation of pre-mRNA splicing in 
      DM1 model cells. Furthermore, the CTG-alkylating ligand may change the 
      d(CAG.CTG)(exp) repeat length dynamics in DM1 patient cells. Our strategy of 
      linking an alkylating moiety to a DNA mismatch-selective small molecule may be 
      generally applicable to other repeat expansion diseases such as Huntington's 
      disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

TI  - Clinical and genetic characteristics of late-onset Huntington's disease in a 
      large European cohort.
PG  - 1940-1951
LID - 10.1111/ene.15340 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant 
      condition caused by CAG-triplet repeat expansions. CAG-triplet repeat expansion 
      is inversely correlated with age of onset in HD and largely determines the 
      clinical features. The aim of this study was to examine the phenotypic and 
      genotypic correlates of late-onset HD (LoHD) and to determine whether LoHD is a 
      more benign expression of HD. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational 
      study of 5053 White European HD patients from the ENROLL-HD database. 
      Sociodemographic, genetic and phenotypic variables at baseline evaluation of 
      subjects with LoHD, common-onset HD (CoHD) and young-onset HD (YoHD) were 
      compared. LoHD subjects were compared with healthy subjects (HS) aged >/=60 years. 
      Differences between the CoHD and LoHD groups were also explored in subjects with 
      41 CAG triplets, a repeat number in the lower pathological expansion range 
      associated with wide variability in age at onset. RESULTS: Late-onset HD 
      presented predominantly as motor-onset disease, with a lower prevalence of both 
      psychiatric history and current symptomatology. Absent/unknown HD family history 
      was significantly more common in the LoHD group (31.2%) than in the other groups. 
      The LoHD group had more severe motor and cognitive deficits than the HS group. 
      Subjects with LoHD and CoHD with 41 triplets in the larger allele were comparable 
      with regard to cognitive impairment, but those with LoHD had more severe motor 
      disorders, less problematic behaviors and more often an unknown HD family 
      history. CONCLUSIONS: It is likely that cognitive disorders and motor symptoms of 
      LoHD are at least partly age-related and not a direct expression of the disease. 
      In addition to CAG-triplet repeat expansion, future studies should investigate 
      the role of other genetic and environmental factors in determining age of onset.

AB  - Safe, efficacious, and deployable vaccines are urgently needed to control 
      COVID-19 in the large-scale vaccination campaigns. We report here the preclinical 
      studies of an approved protein subunit vaccine against COVID-19, ZF2001, which 
      contains tandem-repeat dimeric receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein with 
      alum-based adjuvant. We assessed vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy in both mice 
      and non-human primates (NHPs). ZF2001 induced high levels of RBD-binding and 
      SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody in both mice and non-human primates, and 
      elicited balanced T(H)1/T(H)2 cellular responses in NHPs. Two doses of ZF2001 
      protected Ad-hACE2-transduced mice against SARS-CoV-2 infection, as detected by 
      reduced viral RNA and relieved lung injuries. In NHPs, vaccination of either 
      25 mug or 50 mug ZF2001 prevented infection with SARS-CoV-2 in lung, trachea, and 
      bronchi, with milder lung lesions. No evidence of disease enhancement was 
      observed in both animal models. ZF2001 has been approved for emergency use in 
      China, Uzbekistan, Indonesia, and Columbia. The high safety, immunogenicity, and 
      protection efficacy in both mice and NHPs found in this preclinical study was 
      consistent with the results in human clinical trials.

AB  - Huntington's Disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by 
      CAG trinucleotide repeat expansions in exon 1 of the huntingtin (HTT) gene. The 
      mutant HTT (mHTT) protein causes neuronal dysfunction, causing progressive motor, 
      cognitive and behavioral abnormalities. Current treatments for HD only alleviate 
      symptoms, but cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) or central nervous system (CNS) 
      delivery of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) or virus vectors expressing 
      RNA-induced silencing (RNAi) moieties designed to induce mHTT mRNA lowering have 
      progressed to clinical trials. Here, we present an alternative disease modifying 
      therapy the orally available, brain penetrant small molecule branaplam. By 
      promoting inclusion of a pseudoexon in the primary transcript, branaplam lowers 
      mHTT protein levels in HD patient cells, in an HD mouse model and in blood 
      samples from Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type I patients dosed orally for SMA 
      (NCT02268552). Our work paves the way for evaluating branaplam's utility as an  
      HD therapy, leveraging small molecule splicing modulators to reduce expression of 
      dominant disease genes by driving pseudoexon inclusion.

TI  - Ultrasonographic evaluation reveals thinning of cervical nerve roots and 
      peripheral nerves in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.
PG  - 4267-4274

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ultrasonography (US) is a noninvasive and patient-friendly tool for 
      the evaluation of peripheral nerves. In motor neuron diseases, amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis (ALS) has been reported to show the atrophy of peripheral 
      nerves on US. However, the US findings are still unclear in spinal and bulbar 
      muscular atrophy (SBMA), an adult-onset lower motor neuron disease caused by an 
      abnormal CAG repeat expansion in the androgen receptor gene. METHODS: We 
      prospectively recruited and evaluated 11 patients with genetically confirmed SBMA 
      and 9 patients with ALS diagnosed according to the revised El Escorial ALS 
      criteria or the Awaji electrodiagnostic criteria. The C5-C7 cervical nerve roots 
      and the median and ulnar nerves were evaluated ultrasonographically. RESULTS: The 
      cross-sectional areas (CSAs) of the C6 and C7 nerve roots, the median nerve in 
      the upper arm and forearm, and the ulnar nerve in the upper arm were smaller in 
      patients with SBMA than those in patients with ALS (p < 0.05), whereas the CSAs 
      of the C5 nerve root and the ulnar nerve in the forearm were not smaller. 
      CONCLUSIONS: US showed that the peripheral nerves in patients with SBMA were 
      thinner than those in patients with ALS despite similar degrees of weakness and 
      motor neuron loss. Possible causes include additional sensory nerve involvement 
      and longer disease duration in patients with SBMA than those in patients with 
      ALS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Repeat expansion disorders affect about 1 in 3000 individuals and are 
      clinically heterogeneous diseases caused by expansions of short tandem DNA 
      repeats. Genetic testing is often locus-specific, resulting in underdiagnosis of 
      people who have atypical clinical presentations, especially in paediatric 
      patients without a previous positive family history. Whole genome sequencing is 
      increasingly used as a first-line test for other rare genetic disorders, and we 
      aimed to assess its performance in the diagnosis of patients with neurological 
      repeat expansion disorders. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed the diagnostic 
      accuracy of whole genome sequencing to detect the most common repeat expansion 
      loci associated with neurological outcomes (AR, ATN1, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, 
      C9orf72, CACNA1A, DMPK, FMR1, FXN, HTT, and TBP) using samples obtained within 
      the National Health Service in England from patients who were suspected of having 
      neurological disorders; previous PCR test results were used as the reference 
      standard. The clinical accuracy of whole genome sequencing to detect repeat 
      expansions was prospectively examined in previously genetically tested and 
      undiagnosed patients recruited in 2013-17 to the 100 000 Genomes Project in the 
      UK, who were suspected of having a genetic neurological disorder (familial or 
      early-onset forms of ataxia, neuropathy, spastic paraplegia, dementia, motor 
      neuron disease, parkinsonian movement disorders, intellectual disability, or 
      neuromuscular disorders). If a repeat expansion call was made using whole genome 
      sequencing, PCR was used to confirm the result. FINDINGS: The diagnostic accuracy 
      of whole genome sequencing to detect repeat expansions was evaluated against 793 
      PCR tests previously performed within the NHS from 404 patients. Whole genome 
      sequencing correctly classified 215 of 221 expanded alleles and 1316 of 1321 
      non-expanded alleles, showing 97.3% sensitivity (95% CI 94.2-99.0) and 99.6% 
      specificity (99.1-99.9) across the 13 disease-associated loci when compared with 
      PCR test results. In samples from 11 631 patients in the 100 000 Genomes Project, 
      whole genome sequencing identified 81 repeat expansions, which were also tested 
      by PCR: 68 were confirmed as repeat expansions in the full pathogenic range, 11 
      were non-pathogenic intermediate expansions or premutations, and two were 
      non-expanded repeats (16% false discovery rate). INTERPRETATION: In our study, 
      whole genome sequencing for the detection of repeat expansions showed high 
      sensitivity and specificity, and it led to identification of neurological repeat 
      expansion disorders in previously undiagnosed patients. These findings support 
      implementation of whole genome sequencing in clinical laboratories for diagnosis 
      of patients who have a neurological presentation consistent with a repeat 
      expansion disorder. FUNDING: Medical Research Council, Department of Health and

AB  - Mutations in the DNAJB6 gene cause limb girdle muscular dystrophy D1 (LGMD D1) 
      and distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles. With the discovery of new mutations, 
      the phenotypic spectrum of DNAJB6-related myopathy has been extended, making the 
      diagnosis more complicated. In this study, we describe a female carrier of spinal 
      and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) diagnosed with DNAJB6-related distal myopathy. 
      The c.292_294delGAT (p. Asp98del) mutation in the DNAJB6 gene and a 49 CAG repeat 
      expansion in the androgen receptor (AR) gene were identified. According to the 
      clinical manifestations of distal-dominant lower limb involvement, a myogenic 
      pattern in the electrophysiological study, and rimmed vacuoles on muscle 
      pathology, the patient was ultimately diagnosed with DNAJB6-related distal 
      myopathy. A functional study in a zebrafish model indicated that the 
      c.292_294delGAT (p. Asp98del) mutation contributed to muscle structure defects. 
      This study offers useful insights for the differential diagnosis of a condition 
      in which patients carry pathogenic variants in different genes.

TI  - ATXN10 Is Required for Embryonic Heart Development and Maintenance of Epithelial 
      Cell Phenotypes in the Adult Kidney and Pancreas.
PG  - 705182
LID - 10.3389/fcell.2021.705182 [doi]
LID - 705182
AB  - Atxn10 is a gene known for its role in cytokinesis and is associated with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA10), a slowly progressing cerebellar syndrome caused 
      by an intragenic pentanucleotide repeat expansion. Atxn10 is also implicated in 
      the ciliopathy syndromes nephronophthisis (NPHP) and Joubert syndrome (JBTS), 
      which are caused by the disruption of cilia function leading to nephron loss, 
      impaired renal function, and cerebellar hypoplasia. How Atxn10 disruption 
      contributes to these disorders remains unknown. Here, we generated Atxn10 
      congenital and conditional mutant mouse models. Our data indicate that while 
      ATXN10 protein can be detected around the base of the cilium as well as in the 
      cytosol, its loss does not cause overt changes in cilia formation or morphology. 
      Congenital loss of Atxn10 results in embryonic lethality around E10.5 associated 
      with pericardial effusion and loss of trabeculation. Similarly, tissue-specific 
      loss of ATXN10 in the developing endothelium (Tie2-Cre) and myocardium (cTnT-Cre) 
      also results in embryonic lethality with severe cardiac malformations occurring 
      in the latter. Using an inducible Cagg-CreER to disrupt ATXN10 systemically at 
      postnatal stages, we show that ATXN10 is also required for survival in adult 
      mice. Loss of ATXN10 results in severe pancreatic and renal abnormalities leading 
      to lethality within a few weeks post ATXN10 deletion in adult mice. Evaluation of 
      these phenotypes further identified rapid epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition 
      (EMT) in these tissues. In the pancreas, the phenotype includes signs of both 
      acinar to ductal metaplasia and EMT with aberrant cilia formation and severe 
      defects in glucose homeostasis related to pancreatic insufficiency or defects in 
      feeding or nutrient intake. Collectively, this study identifies ATXN10 as an 
      essential protein for survival.

TI  - Monitoring of Donor-Derived Cell-Free DNA by Short Tandem Repeats: Concentration 
      of Total Cell-Free DNA and Fragment Size for Acute Rejection Risk Assessment in 
      Liver Transplantation.
PG  - 257-268
LID - 10.1002/lt.26272 [doi]
AB  - Monitoring of graft function is essential during the first months after liver 
      transplantation (LT), but current liver function tests (LFTs) lack the 
      specificity and sensitivity to ensure an efficient diagnosis of acute rejection 
      (AR). Recently, donor-derived cell-free DNA (ddcfDNA) has emerged as a 
      noninvasive biomarker to assess graft integrity. This study evaluated the 
      feasibility of measuring the ddcfDNA through short tandem repeat (STR) analysis 
      by quantitative fluorescent-polymerase chain reaction (QF-PCR) and to assess the 
      role of the concentration and fragment size of total cfDNA as AR biomarkers. The 
      total concentration and fragment size of cfDNA and the ddcfDNA percentage were 
      monitored in plasma of 20 patients without rejection and 7 patients with 
      T-cell-mediated AR during the first 3 months after LT. The median ddcfDNA 
      percentage was 3-fold higher before AR diagnosis (34.8%; P < 0.001) and 
      moderately higher at AR confirmatory diagnosis (23.8%; P = 0.049) compared with 
      that of nonrejector patients (10.6%), showing a better performance (area under 
      the curve = 84.6%) than conventional LFTs to predict the risk of rejection within 
      the first 2 weeks following LT. The fraction of 100-250-bp cfDNA fragments was 
      higher at AR diagnosis compared with that of nonrejector patients (68.0% versus 
      57.9%, P = 0.02). STR amplification by QF-PCR may be an alternative strategy for 
      rapid ddcfDNA quantification, which is easily implementable in clinical 
      laboratories. The results of this pilot study indicate that ddcfDNA increases 
      very early, even 1-2 weeks before the diagnosis of AR, and so it could be useful 
      as a prognostic biomarker in improving patient risk stratification.

TI  - Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Genetic Access Program: Paving the Way for Genetic 
      Characterization of ALS in the Clinic.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report the frequency of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) genetic 
      variants in a nationwide cohort of clinic-based patients with ALS with a family 
      history of ALS (fALS), dementia (dALS), or both ALS and dementia (fALS/dALS). 
      METHODS: A multicenter, prospective cohort of 573 patients with fALS, dALS, or 
      fALS/dALS, underwent genetic testing in the ALS Genetic Access Program (ALS GAP), 
      a clinical program for clinics of the Northeast ALS Consortium. Patients with 
      dALS underwent C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) testing; those with 
      fALS or fALS/dALS underwent C9orf72 HRE testing, followed by sequencing of SOD1, 
      FUS, TARDBP, TBK1, and VCP. RESULTS: A pathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP) 
      variant was identified in 171/573 (30%) of program participants. About half of 
      patients with fALS or fALS/dALS (138/301, 45.8%) had either a C9orf72 HRE or a P 
      or LP variant identified in SOD1, FUS, TARDBP, TBK1, or VCP. The use of a 
      targeted, 5-gene sequencing panel resulted in far fewer uncertain test outcomes 
      in familial cases compared with larger panels used in other in clinic-based 
      cohorts. Among dALS cases 11.8% (32/270) were found to have the C9orf72 HRE. 
      Patients of non-Caucasian geoancestry were less likely to test positive for the 
      C9orf72 HRE, but were more likely to test positive on panel testing, compared 
      with those of Caucasian ancestry. CONCLUSIONS: The ALS GAP program provided a 
      genetic diagnosis to  approximately 1 in 3 participants and may serve as a model for clinical 
      genetic testing in ALS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Screening for short tandem repeat (STR) expansions in next-generation 
      sequencing data can enable diagnosis, optimal clinical management/treatment, and 
      accurate genetic counseling of patients with repeat expansion disorders. We aimed 
      to develop an efficient computational workflow for reliable detection of STR 
      expansions in next-generation sequencing data and demonstrate its clinical 
      utility. METHODS: We characterized the performance of eight STR analysis methods 
      (lobSTR, HipSTR, RepeatSeq, ExpansionHunter, TREDPARSE, GangSTR, STRetch, and 
      exSTRa) on next-generation sequencing datasets of samples with known 
      disease-causing full-mutation STR expansions and genomes simulated to harbor 
      repeat expansions at selected loci and optimized their sensitivity. We then used 
      a machine learning decision tree classifier to identify an optimal combination of 
      methods for full-mutation detection. In Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA)-aligned 
      genomes, the ensemble approach of using ExpansionHunter, STRetch, and exSTRa 
      performed the best (precision = 82%, recall = 100%, F1-score = 90%). We applied 
      this pipeline to screen 301 families of children with suspected genetic 
      disorders. RESULTS: We identified 10 individuals with full-mutations in the AR, 
      ATXN1, ATXN8, DMPK, FXN, or HTT disease STR locus in the analyzed families. 
      Additional candidates identified in our analysis include two probands with 
      borderline ATXN2 expansions between the established repeat size range for 
      reduced-penetrance and full-penetrance full-mutation and seven individuals with 
      FMR1 CGG repeats in the intermediate/premutation repeat size range. In 67 
      probands with a prior negative clinical PCR test for the FMR1, FXN, or DMPK 
      disease STR locus, or the spinocerebellar ataxia disease STR panel, our pipeline 
      did not falsely identify aberrant expansion. We performed clinical PCR tests on 
      seven (out of 10) full-mutation samples identified by our pipeline and confirmed 
      the expansion status in all, showing absolute concordance between our 
      bioinformatics and molecular findings. CONCLUSIONS: We have successfully 
      demonstrated the application of a well-optimized bioinformatics pipeline that 
      promotes the utility of genome-wide sequencing as a first-tier screening test to 
      detect expansions of known disease STRs. Interrogating clinical next-generation 
      sequencing data for pathogenic STR expansions using our ensemble pipeline can 
      improve diagnostic yield and enhance clinical outcomes for patients with repeat 
      expansion disorders.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of the long-acting 
      oxytetracycline (OTC) treatment on A. marginale genotypes of the isolate S1P, by 
      analyzing the msp1alpha genotype based on a microsatellite (ms) and tandem repeat 
      sequences (TRS) located at the 5  end of the gene. DNA samples were obtained from 
      a longitudinal study of chemosterilization; 10 2-year-old steers were 
      experimentally infected with blood from a splenectomized calf inoculated with 
      the A. marginale isolate S1P. All the steers had received a first dose of 20 mg 
      kg(-1) OTC to treat acute disease, and once recovered all steers received a 
      sterilizing treatment based on three doses of 20 mg kg(-1) OTC 7 days apart. 
      Blood from two steers not sterilized by the treatment was inoculated into two 
      splenectomized calves (receptors) 104 days after treatment. DNA samples (S) used 
      for msp1alpha amplification were obtained from i) the donor calf (S0), ii) 10 steers 
      during acute disease (S1), after the first antibiotic treatment (S2), and after 
      the chemosterilization procedure (S3 and S4), and iii) two receptor calves (S5). 
      Thirty clones from the donor calf and at least 5 clones from the other DNA 
      samples were analyzed. The genotype E/alphabetabetabetabetacapital GHE, Cyrillic msp1alpha identified in the donor calf 
      and steers, before OTC treatment, was not detected either in steers that 
      continued infected after the sterilizing treatment or in the receptor calves, in 
      which only genotype C/EvarphiFF msp1alpha was observed. These results highlight the 
      existence of A. marginale genotypes with different sensitivity to OTC and the 
      importance of other variables to successfully sterilize the carriers.

TI  - A Novel Minor Groove Binder as a Potential Therapeutic Agent for Myotonic 
      Dystrophy Type 1.
PG  - 2638-2644
LID - 10.1002/cmdc.202100243 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a multisystemic neuromuscular disorder that is 
      inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. DM1 originates in a (CTG...CAG) repeat 
      expansion in the 3'-UTR of the dystrophia myotonic protein kinase (DMPK) gene on 
      chromosome 19. One of the transcripts, r(CUG)(exp) , is toxic in various ways. 
      Herein we report a rationally designed small molecule with a thiazole 
      peptidomimetic unit that can serve as a minor groove binder for the nucleic acid 
      targets. This peptide unit linked to two triaminotriazine recognition units 
      selectively binds to d(CTG)(exp) to inhibit the transcription process, and also 
      targets r(CUG)(exp) selectively to improve representative DM1 pathological 
      molecular features, including foci formation and pre-mRNA splicing defects in DM1 
      model cells. As such, it represents a new structure type that might serve as a 
      lead compound for future structure-activity optimization.

TI  - The structure, function and evolution of a complete human chromosome 8.
PG  - 101-107
LID - 10.1038/s41586-021-03420-7 [doi]
AB  - The complete assembly of each human chromosome is essential for understanding 
      human biology and evolution(1,2). Here we use complementary long-read sequencing 
      technologies to complete the linear assembly of human chromosome 8. Our assembly 
      resolves the sequence of five previously long-standing gaps, including a 2.08-Mb 
      centromeric alpha-satellite array, a 644-kb copy number polymorphism in the 
      beta-defensin gene cluster that is important for disease risk, and an 863-kb 
      variable number tandem repeat at chromosome 8q21.2 that can function as a 
      neocentromere. We show that the centromeric alpha-satellite array is generally 
      methylated except for a 73-kb hypomethylated region of diverse higher-order 
      alpha-satellites enriched with CENP-A nucleosomes, consistent with the location of 
      the kinetochore. In addition, we confirm the overall organization and methylation 
      pattern of the centromere in a diploid human genome. Using a dual long-read 
      sequencing approach, we complete high-quality draft assemblies of the orthologous 
      centromere from chromosome 8 in chimpanzee, orangutan and macaque to reconstruct 
      its evolutionary history. Comparative and phylogenetic analyses show that the 
      higher-order alpha-satellite structure evolved in the great ape ancestor with a 
      layered symmetry, in which more ancient higher-order repeats locate peripherally 
      to monomeric alpha-satellites. We estimate that the mutation rate of centromeric 
      satellite DNA is accelerated by more than 2.2-fold compared to the unique 
      portions of the genome, and this acceleration extends into the flanking sequence.

LID - e143465
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is caused by a CTG repeat expansion in the DMPK 
      gene. Expression of pathogenic expanded CUG repeat (CUGexp) RNA causes 
      multisystemic disease by perturbing the functions of RNA-binding proteins, 
      resulting in expression of fetal protein isoforms in adult tissues. Cardiac 
      involvement affects 50% of individuals with DM1 and causes 25% of disease-related 
      deaths. We developed a transgenic mouse model for tetracycline-inducible and 
      heart-specific expression of human DMPK mRNA containing 960 CUG repeats. CUGexp 
      RNA is expressed in atria and ventricles and induced mice exhibit 
      electrophysiological and molecular features of DM1 disease, including cardiac 
      conduction delays, supraventricular arrhythmias, nuclear RNA foci with 
      Muscleblind protein colocalization, and alternative splicing defects. 
      Importantly, these phenotypes were rescued upon loss of CUGexp RNA expression. 
      Transcriptome analysis revealed gene expression and alternative splicing changes 
      in ion transport genes that are associated with inherited cardiac conduction 
      diseases, including a subset of genes involved in calcium handling. Consistent 
      with RNA-Seq results, calcium-handling defects were identified in atrial 
      cardiomyocytes isolated from mice expressing CUGexp RNA. These results identify 
      potential tissue-specific mechanisms contributing to cardiac pathogenesis in DM1 
      and demonstrate the utility of reversible phenotypes in our model to facilitate 
      development of targeted therapeutic approaches.

TI  - mixIndependR: a R package for statistical independence testing of loci in 
      database of multi-locus genotypes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multi-locus genotype data are widely used in population genetics and 
      disease studies. In evaluating the utility of multi-locus data, the independence 
      of markers is commonly considered in many genomic assessments. Generally, 
      pairwise non-random associations are tested by linkage disequilibrium; however, 
      the dependence of one panel might be triplet, quartet, or other. Therefore, a 
      compatible and user-friendly software is necessary for testing and assessing the 
      global linkage disequilibrium among mixed genetic data. RESULTS: This study 
      describes a software package for testing the mutual independence of mixed genetic 
      datasets. Mutual independence is defined as no non-random associations among all 
      subsets of the tested panel. The new R package "mixIndependR" calculates basic 
      genetic parameters like allele frequency, genotype frequency, heterozygosity, 
      Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and linkage disequilibrium (LD) by mutual 
      independence from population data, regardless of the type of markers, such as 
      simple nucleotide polymorphisms, short tandem repeats, insertions and deletions, 
      and any other genetic markers. A novel method of assessing the dependence of 
      mixed genetic panels is developed in this study and functionally analyzed in the 
      software package. By comparing the observed distribution of two common summary 
      statistics (the number of heterozygous loci [K] and the number of share alleles 
      [X]) with their expected distributions under the assumption of mutual 
      independence, the overall independence is tested. CONCLUSION: The package 
      "mixIndependR" is compatible to all categories of genetic markers and detects the 
      overall non-random associations. Compared to pairwise disequilibrium, the 
      approach described herein tends to have higher power, especially when number of 
      markers is large. With this package, more multi-functional or stronger genetic 
      panels can be developed, like mixed panels with different kinds of markers. In 
      population genetics, the package "mixIndependR" makes it possible to discover 
      more about admixture of populations, natural selection, genetic drift, and 
      population demographics, as a more powerful method of detecting LD. Moreover, 
      this new approach can optimize variants selection in disease studies and 
      contribute to panel combination for treatments in multimorbidity. Application of 
      this approach in real data is expected in the future, and this might bring a leap 
      in the field of genetic technology. AVAILABILITY: The R package mixIndependR, is 
      available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at: 
      https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mixIndependR/index.html .

TI  - Identification and characterization of a Babesia bigemina thrombospondin-related

      involved in merozoite invasion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (TRAP) has been described as 
      a potential vaccine candidate for several diseases caused by apicomplexan 
      parasites. However, this protein and members of this family have not yet been 
      characterized in Babesia bigemina, one of the most prevalent species causing 
      bovine babesiosis. METHODS: The 3186-bp Babesia bigemina TRAP-1 (BbiTRAP-1) gene 
      was identified by a bioinformatics search using the B. bovis TRAP-1 sequence. 
      Members of the TRAP and TRAP-related protein families (TRP) were identified in 
      Babesia and Theileria through a search of the TSP-1 adhesive domain, which is the 
      hallmark motif in both proteins. Structural modeling and phylogenetic analysis 
      were performed with the identified TRAP proteins. A truncated recombinant 
      BbiTRAP-1 that migrates at approximately 107 kDa and specific antisera were 
      produced and used in Western blot analysis and indirect fluorescent antibody 
      tests (IFAT). B-cell epitopes with neutralizing activity in BbiTRAP-1 were 
      defined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and invasion assays. 
      RESULTS: Three members of the TRAP family of proteins were identified in B. 
      bigemina (BbiTRAP-1 to -3). All are type 1 transmembrane proteins containing the 
      von Willebrand factor A (vWFA), thrombospondin type 1 (TSP-1), and cytoplasmic 
      C-terminus domains, as well as transmembrane regions. The BbiTRAP-1 predicted 
      structure also contains a metal ion-dependent adhesion site for interaction with 
      the host cell. The TRP family in Babesia and Theileria species contains the 
      canonical TSP-1 domain but lacks the vWFA domain and together with TRAP define a 
      novel gene superfamily. A variable number of tandem repeat units are present in 
      BbiTRAP-1 and could be used for strain genotyping. Western blot and IFAT analysis 
      confirmed the expression of BbiTRAP-1 by blood-stage parasites. Partial 
      recognition by a panel of sera from B. bigemina-infected cattle in ELISAs using 
      truncated BbiTRAP-1 suggests that this protein is not an immunodominant antigen. 
      Additionally, bovine anti-recombinant BbiTRAP-1 antibodies were found to be 
      capable of neutralizing merozoite invasion in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: We have 
      identified the TRAP and TRP gene families in several Babesia and Theileria 
      species and characterized BbiTRAP-1 as a novel antigen of B. bigemina. The 
      functional relevance and presence of neutralization-sensitive B-cell epitopes 
      suggest that BbiTRAP-1 could be included in tests for future vaccine candidates 
      against B. bigemina.

TI  - Genetic analysis for carrier diagnosis in hemophilia A and B in the Mexican 
      population: 25 years of experience.
PG  - 939-954
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.c.31854 [doi]
AB  - Our 25 years of experience in carrier diagnosis of hemophilia A (HA) and B (HB) 
      in Mexican population comprises linkage analysis of intragenic F8/F9 neutral 
      variants along with, in severe HA (SHA), detection of F8 int22h and int1h 
      inversions. In symptomatic carriers (SCs) we explored Lyonization to explain 
      their symtomatology. From a DNA-Bank of 3,000 samples, intragenic restriction 
      fragment length (RFLPs) and short tandem repeats (STRs) of F8/F9 genes were 
      assessed by PCR-PAGE and GeneScan. In SHA patients, F8 inversions were detected 
      by inverse shifting-PCR/diagnostic and complementary tests. In SCs, we evaluated 
      hemorrhagic symptoms, clotting FVIII/FIX and X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) 
      patterns were assessed by HUMARA assay and the search of XIST promoter pathogenic 
      variants. Informativeness of linkage analysis for HA carrier diagnosis with 
      RFLP's/STR's increased to 74% and reached 80% with five RFLPs for HB. Combined 
      Inv22/Inv1 diagnosed 113 possible carriers, three de novo Inv22-1, and confirmed 
      45 mothers as obligate or sporadic carriers. Among 21 SCs, four showed extreme 
      skewed XCI pattern (~80:20) but had normal karyotype and no C43G pathogenic 
      variant in XIST promoter. Clotting FVIII/FIX correlated with the active X in 
      leukocytes. Our data integrate the largest comprehensive research worldwide on 
      the molecular diagnosis of HA and HB carriers in terms of the number of studied 
      and diagnosed cases, in addition to the genetic analysis in SCs. Intragenic RFLPs 
      and STRs of F8/F9 genes along with F8 int22h/int1h inversions in SHA emerge as 
      optimal variants for molecular diagnosis in Mexican population. In counseling 
      SCs, inheritance of skewed X-inactivation should be considered.

TI  - Identification of GGC repeat expansion in the NOTCH2NLC gene in amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis.
PG  - e3394-e3405
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000010945 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the GGC repeats in the NOTCH2NLC gene contribute 
      to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). METHODS: In this study, 545 patients with 
      ALS and 1,305 healthy controls from mainland China were recruited. Several 
      pathogenic mutations in known ALS-causative genes (including C9ORF72 and ATXN2) 
      and polynucleotide repeat expansions in NOP56 and AR genes were excluded. 
      Repeat-primed PCR and GC-rich PCR were performed to determine the GGC repeat size 
      in NOTCH2NLC. Systematic and targeted clinical evaluations and investigations, 
      including skin biopsy and dynamic electrophysiologic studies, were conducted in 
      the genetically affected patients. RESULTS: GGC repeat expansion was observed in 
      4 patients (numbers of repeats 44, 54, 96, and 143), accounting for  approximately 0.73% (4 of 
      545) of all patients with ALS. A comparison with 1,305 healthy controls revealed 
      that GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC was associated with ALS (Fisher exact 
      test, 4 of 545 vs 0 of 1,305, p = 0.007). Compared to patients with the neuronal 
      intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) muscle weakness-dominant subtype, patients 
      with ALS phenotype carrying the abnormal repeat expansion tended to have a severe 
      phenotype and rapid deterioration. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that ALS is a 
      specific phenotype of NIID or that GGC expansion in NOTCH2NLC is a factor that 
      modifies ALS. These findings may help clarify the pathogenic mechanism of ALS and 
      may expand the known clinical spectrum of NIID.

AB  - Maintaining the fidelity of nascent peptide chain (NP) synthesis is essential for 
      proteome integrity and cellular health. Ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) 
      serves to resolve stalled translation, during which untemplated Ala/Thr residues 
      are added C terminally to stalled peptide, as shown during C-terminal Ala and Thr 
      addition (CAT-tailing) in yeast. The mechanism and biological effects of 
      CAT-tailing-like activity in metazoans remain unclear. Here we show that 
      CAT-tailing-like modification of poly(GR), a dipeptide repeat derived from 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD)-associated 
      GGGGCC (G4C2) repeat expansion in C9ORF72, contributes to disease. We find that 
      poly(GR) can act as a mitochondria-targeting signal, causing some poly(GR) to be 
      cotranslationally imported into mitochondria. However, poly(GR) translation on 
      mitochondrial surface is frequently stalled, triggering RQC and CAT-tailing-like 
      C-terminal extension (CTE). CTE promotes poly(GR) stabilization, aggregation, and 
      toxicity. Our genetic studies in Drosophila uncovered an important role of the 
      mitochondrial protease YME1L in clearing poly(GR), revealing mitochondria as 
      major sites of poly(GR) metabolism. Moreover, the mitochondria-associated 
      noncanonical Notch signaling pathway impinges on the RQC machinery to restrain 
      poly(GR) accumulation, at least in part through the AKT/VCP axis. The conserved 
      actions of YME1L and noncanonical Notch signaling in animal models and patient 
      cells support their fundamental involvement in ALS/FTD.

TI  - Identification of Potential Genes for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and Prostate 
      Cancer Susceptibility in Four X-chromosome Regions with High Frequency of 
      Microvariant Alleles.
PG  - 2271-2280
LID - 89217 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: The X-chromosome has been suggested to play a role in prostate cancer 
      (PrCa) since epidemiological studies have provided evidence for an X-linked mode 
      of inheritance for PrCa based on the higher relative risk among men who report an 
      affected brother(s) as compared to those reporting an affected father. The aim of 
      this study was to examine the potential association between the forensic STR 
      markers located at four regions Xp22.31, Xq11.2-12, Xq26.2, and Xq28 and the risk 
      of BPH and PrCa to confirm the impact of ChrX in the PrCa incidence. This may be 
      helpful in the incorporation of STRs genetic variation in the early detection of 
      men population at risk of developing PrCa. METHODS: DNA samples from 92 patients 
      and 156 healthy controls collected from two medical centers in Riyadh, Saudi 
      Arabia were analyzed for four regions located at X-chromosome using the 
      Investigator(R) Argus X-12 QS Kit. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that 
      microvariant alleles of (DXS7132, DXS10146, HPRTB, DXS10134, and DXS10135) are 
      overrepresented in the BPH group (p < 0.00001). Allele 28 of DXS10135 and allele 
      15 of DXS7423 could have a protective effect, OR 0.229 (95%CI, 0.066-0.79); and 
      OR 0.439 (95%CI, 0.208-0.925). On the other hand, patients carrying allele 23 of 
      DXS10079 and allele 26 of DXS10148 presented an increased risk to PrCa OR 4.714 
      (95%CI, 3.604-6.166). CONCLUSION: The results are in concordance with the 
      involvement of the X chromosome in PrCa and BPH development. STR allele studies 
      may add further information from the definition of a genetic profile of PrCa 
      resistance or susceptibility. As TBL1, AR, LDOC1, and RPL10 genes are located at 
      regions Xp22.31, Xq11.2-12, Xq26.2, and Xq28, respectively, these genes could 
      play an essential role in PrCa or BPH.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) manifests pathological changes in motor 
      neurons and various other cell types. Compared to motor neurons, the contribution 
      of the other cell types to the ALS phenotypes is understudied. G4C2 repeat 
      expansion in C9ORF72 is the most common genetic cause of ALS along with 
      frontotemporal dementia (C9-ALS/FTD), with increasing evidence supporting 
      repeat-encoded poly(GR) in disease pathogenesis. Here, we show in Drosophila 
      muscle that poly(GR) enters mitochondria and interacts with components of the 
      Mitochondrial Contact Site and Cristae Organizing System (MICOS), altering MICOS 
      dynamics and intra-subunit interactions. This impairs mitochondrial inner 
      membrane structure, ion homeostasis, mitochondrial metabolism, and muscle 
      integrity. Similar mitochondrial defects are observed in patient fibroblasts. 
      Genetic manipulation of MICOS components or pharmacological restoration of ion 
      homeostasis with nigericin effectively rescue the mitochondrial pathology and 
      disease phenotypes in both systems. These results implicate MICOS-regulated ion 
      homeostasis in C9-ALS pathogenesis and suggest potential new therapeutic 
      strategies.

AB  - X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), also known as Kennedy 
      syndrome, is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized by slowly 
      progressive muscle atrophy and other severe symptoms gradually leading to reduced 
      mobility and ultimately to death due to respiratory failure. Two decades ago we 
      reported the first prenatal diagnosis of SBMA worldwide. Here we present a Greek 
      family in which we have performed seven prenatal DNA tests for SBMA mutation 
      after extensive genetic counseling. Since there is not yet a cure for SBMA, 
      prenatal testing may be a good choice for couples at risk for prevention of this 
      neurodegenerative disorder in their offspring. The issues addressed during 
      genetic counseling for such a disabling disorder of adult onset are discussed as 
      a paradigm for other conditions with similar characteristics.

AB  - Brucellosis in rams is caused by Brucella ovis or Brucella melitensis and it is 
      considered one of the most important infectious diseases of males in 
      sheep-raising countries. Molecular characterization of Brucella spp. achieved by 
      multi-locus variable number of tandem repeats analysis (MLVA) is a powerful tool 
      to genotype Brucella spp. However, data regarding B. ovis genotyping is scarce. 
      Thus, the aim of this study was to characterize the molecular diversity of B. 
      ovis field-strains in Argentina. A total of 115 isolates of B. ovis from 
      Argentina and Uruguay were genotyped using MLVA-16 and analyzed altogether with 
      14 publicly available B. ovis genotypes from Brazil. The Discriminatory Power (D) 
      was 0.996 for MLVA-16 and 0.0998 for MLVA-8 and MLVA-11. Analysis of MLVA-16 
      revealed 100 different genotypes, all of them novel, including 90 unique ones. 
      There was no correlation between geographical distribution and genotype and 
      results showed a higher diversity within provinces than between provinces. 
      Clustering analysis of the strains from Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil revealed 
      that the 129 isolates were grouped into two clades. Whole Genome Sequencing 
      analysis of the 19 B. ovis genomes available in public databases, and including 
      some of the Argentinian strains used in this study, revealed clustering of the 
      Argentinian isolates and closer relationship with B. ovis from New Zealand and 
      Australia. This work adds new data to the poorly understood distribution map of 
      genotypes regionally and worldwide for B. ovis and it constitutes the largest 
      study of B. ovis molecular genotyping until now.

      AR gene.
PG  - e1207

LID - e1207
AB  - BACKGROUND: The androgen receptor (AR) is a nuclear receptor, encoded by the AR 
      gene on the X chromosome. Within the first exon of the AR gene, two short tandem 
      repeats (STR), CAG and GGC, are a source of polymorphism in the population. 
      Therefore, high-throughput methods for screening AR, such as next-generation 
      sequencing (NGS), are sought after; however, data generated by NGS are limited by 
      the availability of bioinformatics tools. Here, we evaluated the accuracy of the 
      bioinformatics tool HipSTR in detecting and quantify CAG repeats within the AR 
      gene. METHOD: The AR gene of 228 infertile men was sequenced using NGSgene panel. 
      Data generated were analyzed with HipSTR to detect CAG repeats. The accuracy was 
      compared with the results obtained with Sanger. RESULTS: We found that HipSTR was 
      more accurate than Sanger in genotyping normal karyotype men (46,XY), however, it 
      was more likely to misidentify homozygote genotypes in men with Klinefelter 
      syndrome (47,XXY). CONCLUSION: Our findings show that the bioinformatics tool 
      HipSTR is 100% accurate in detecting and assessing AR CAG repeats in infertile 
      men (46,XY) as well as in men with low-level mosaicism.

TI  - Precise Targeted Cleavage of a r(CUG) Repeat Expansion in Cells by Using a 
      Small-Molecule-Deglycobleomycin Conjugate.
PG  - 849-855
LID - 10.1021/acschembio.0c00036 [doi]
AB  - RNA repeat expansions cause more than 30 neurological and neuromuscular diseases 
      with no known cures. Since repeat expansions operate via diverse pathomechanisms, 
      one potential therapeutic strategy is to rid them from disease-affected cells, 
      using bifunctional small molecules that cleave the aberrant RNA. Such an approach 
      has been previously implemented for the RNA repeat that causes myotonic dystrophy 
      type 1 [DM1, r(CUG)(exp)] with Cugamycin, which is a small molecule that 
      selectively binds r(CUG)(exp) conjugated to a bleomycin A5 cleaving module. 
      Herein, we demonstrate that, by replacing bleomycin A5 with deglycobleomycin, an 
      analogue in which the carbohydrate domain of bleomycin A5 is removed, the 
      selectivity of the resulting small-molecule conjugate (DeglycoCugamycin) was 
      enhanced, while maintaining potent and allele-selective cleavage of r(CUG)(exp) 
      and rescue of DM1-associated defects. In particular, DeglycoCugamycin did not 
      induce the DNA damage that is observed with high concentrations (25 muM) of 
      Cugamycin, while selectively cleaving the disease-causing allele and improving 
      DM1 defects at 1 muM.

TI  - Deterioration of muscle force and contractile characteristics are early 
      pathological events in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy mice.

AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), also known as Kennedy's Disease, is a 
      late-onset X-linked progressive neuromuscular disease, which predominantly 
      affects males. The pathological hallmarks of the disease are selective loss of 
      spinal and bulbar motor neurons, accompanied by weakness, atrophy and 
      fasciculations of bulbar and limb muscles. SBMA is caused by a CAG repeat 
      expansion in the gene that encodes the androgen receptor (AR) protein. Disease 
      manifestation is androgen dependent and results principally from a toxic gain of 
      AR function. There are currently no effective treatments for this debilitating 
      disease. It is important to understand the course of the disease in order to 
      target therapeutics to key pathological stages. This is especially relevant in 
      disorders such as SBMA, for which disease can be identified before symptom onset, 
      through family history and genetic testing. To fully characterise the role of 
      muscle in SBMA, we undertook a longitudinal physiological and histological 
      characterisation of disease progression in the AR100 mouse model of SBMA. Our 
      results show that the disease first manifests in skeletal muscle, before any 
      motor neuron degeneration, which only occurs in late-stage disease. These 
      findings reveal that alterations in muscle function, including reduced muscle 
      force and changes in contractile characteristics, are early pathological events 
      in SBMA mice and suggest that muscle-targeted therapeutics may be effective in 
      SBMA.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author 
      of the paper.

      Mutational analysis of putative regulatory binding motifs.

AB  - The human hs1.2 enhancer within the Ig heavy chain gene (IGH) is polymorphic and 
      associated with a number of autoimmune diseases. The polymorphic region is 
      characterized by tandem repeats of an  approximately 53-bp invariant sequence containing 
      possible binding sites for several transcription factors. Our previous studies 
      suggest the human hs1.2 enhancer is sensitive to 
      2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), an environmental toxicant and high 
      affinity ligand of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). TCDD induced hs1.2 
      enhancer activity in an AhR-dependent manner and the number of invariant 
      sequences influenced the magnitude of activity. To better understand the 
      regulation of human hs1.2 enhancer activity, the objective of the current study 
      was to utilize mutational analysis and luciferase reporter constructs to evaluate 
      the contribution of putative transcription factor binding sites to overall hs1.2 
      enhancer activity and modulation by TCDD. Basal and LPS-induced activity of the 
      hs1.2 enhancer appeared to be most affected by mutation of sites outside of the 
      invariant sequence or deletion of the entire invariant sequence; whereas sites 
      influencing the effect of TCDD were dependent on the cellular activation state 
      (i.e. unstimulated vs. LPS stimulation) and relatively independent of the 
      putative AhR binding site within the invariant sequence. These results suggest 
      that AhR activation affects human hs1.2 activity through an as yet undetermined 
      non-canonical pathway. A better understanding regarding the role of the hs1.2 
      enhancer in human Ig expression and how AhR ligands modulate its activity may 
      lead to insights into overall Ig regulation and mechanisms of dysfunction.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a multisystemic genetic disorder caused by the 
      CTG repeat expansion in the 3'-untranslated region of DMPK gene. Heart 
      dysfunctions occur in  approximately 80% of DM1 patients and are the second leading cause of 
      DM1-related deaths. Herein, we report that upregulation of a non-muscle splice 
      isoform of RNA-binding protein RBFOX2 in DM1 heart tissue-due to altered splicing 
      factor and microRNA activities-induces cardiac conduction defects in DM1 
      individuals. Mice engineered to express the non-muscle RBFOX2(40) isoform in 
      heart via tetracycline-inducible transgenesis, or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome 
      editing, reproduced DM1-related cardiac conduction delay and spontaneous episodes 
      of arrhythmia. Further, by integrating RNA binding with cardiac transcriptome 
      datasets from DM1 patients and mice expressing the non-muscle RBFOX2 isoform, we 
      identified RBFOX2(40)-driven splicing defects in voltage-gated sodium and 
      potassium channels, which alter their electrophysiological properties. Thus, our 
      results uncover a trans-dominant role for an aberrantly expressed RBFOX2(40) 
      isoform in DM1 cardiac pathogenesis.

      transcriptome analysis of purified motor neurons derived from disease specific

AB  - Spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an adult-onset, slowly progressive motor 
      neuron disease caused by abnormal CAG repeat expansion in the androgen receptor 
      (AR) gene. Although ligand (testosterone)-dependent mutant AR aggregation has 
      been shown to play important roles in motor neuronal degeneration by the analyses 
      of transgenic mice models and in vitro cell culture models, the underlying 
      disease mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated because of the discrepancy 
      between model mice and SBMA patients. Thus, novel human disease models that 
      recapitulate SBMA patients' pathology more accurately are required for more 
      precise pathophysiological analysis and the development of novel therapeutics. 
      Here, we established disease specific iPSCs from four SBMA patients, and 
      differentiated them into spinal motor neurons. To investigate motor neuron 
      specific pathology, we purified iPSC-derived motor neurons using flow cytometry 
      and cell sorting based on the motor neuron specific reporter, HB9(e438)::Venus, 
      and proceeded to the genome-wide transcriptome analysis by RNA sequences. The 
      results revealed the involvement of the pathology associated with synapses, 
      epigenetics, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in SBMA. Notably, we demonstrated the 
      involvement of the neuromuscular synapse via significant upregulation of 
      Synaptotagmin, R-Spondin2 (RSPO2), and WNT ligands in motor neurons derived from 
      SBMA patients, which are known to be associated with neuromuscular junction (NMJ) 
      formation and acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering. These aberrant gene 
      expression in neuromuscular synapses might represent a novel therapeutic target 
      for SBMA.

AB  - Alterations in protein folding may lead to aggregation of misfolded proteins, 
      which is strongly correlated with neurotoxicity and cell death. Protein 
      aggregation has been shown as a normal consequence of aging, but it is largely 
      associated with age-related disease, particularly neurodegenerative diseases like 
      Huntington disease (HD). HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin 
      gene and serves as a useful model for neurodegeneration due to its strictly 
      genetic origin. Research in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans suggests 
      that glucose protects against cell stress, including proteotoxicity related to 
      aggregation, despite the well-known, lifespan-shortening effects of glucose. We 
      hypothesized that glucose could be beneficial by alleviating energy deficiency, a 
      well-characterized phenomenon in HD. We used C. elegans expressing polyglutamine 
      repeats to quantify lifespan, motility, reproduction, learning, and activity of 
      succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), with and without glucose, to identify the role of 
      glucose in proteotoxicity and neuroprotection. Our data show poly-Q worms on 
      glucose plates exhibited shorter lifespans, no change in motility, learning, or 
      SDH product formation, but had altered reproductive phenotypes. Notably, worms 
      expressing toxic polyglutamine repeats were unable to learn association of food 
      with a neutral odorant, even early in life.

AB  - Although the heritability of cognitive function in old age is substantial, 
      genome-wide association studies have had limited success in elucidating its 
      genetic basis, leaving a considerable amount of "missing heritability." Aside 
      from single nucleotide polymorphisms, genome-wide association studies are unable 
      to assess other large sources of genetic variation, such as tandem repeat 
      polymorphisms. Therefore, here, we studied the association of 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat variations in polyglutamine 
      disease-associated genes (PDAGs) with cognitive function in older adults. In a 
      large cohort consisting of 5786 participants, we found that the CAG repeat number 
      in 3 PDAGs (TBP, HTT, and AR) were significantly associated with the decline in 
      cognitive function, which together accounted for 0.49% of the variation. 
      Furthermore, in an magnetic resonance imaging substudy, we found that CAG repeat 
      polymorphisms in 4 PDAGs (ATXN2, CACNA1A, ATXN7, and AR) were associated with 
      different imaging characteristics, including brain stem, putamen, globus 
      pallidus, thalamus, and amygdala volumes. Our findings indicate that tandem 
      repeat polymorphisms are associated with cognitive function in older adults and 
      highlight the importance of PDAGs in elucidating its missing heritability.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Gastrointestinal cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death 
      worldwide. The aim of this study was to verify whether the genotype of six short 
      tandem repeat (STR) loci including AR, Bat-25, D5S346, ER1, ER2, and FGA is 
      associated with the risk of gastric cancer (GC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) and 
      to develop a model that allows early diagnosis and prediction of inherited 
      genomic susceptibility to GC and CRC. METHODS: Alleles of six STR loci were 
      determined using the peripheral blood of six colon cancer patients, five rectal 
      cancer patients, eight GC patients, and 30 healthy controls. Fisher linear 
      discriminant analysis (FDA) was used to establish the discriminant formula to 
      distinguish GC and CRC patients from healthy controls. Leave-one-out cross 
      validation and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to 
      validate the accuracy of the formula. The relationship between the STR status and 
      immunohistochemical (IHC) and tumor markers was analyzed using multiple 
      correspondence analysis. RESULTS: D5S346 was confirmed as a GC- and CRC-related 
      STR locus. For the first time, we established a discriminant formula on the basis 
      of the six STR loci, which was used to estimate the risk coefficient of suffering 
      from GC and CRC. The model was statistically significant (Wilks' lambda = 0.471, 
      chi2 = 30.488, df = 13, and p = 0.004). The results of leave-one-out cross 
      validation showed that the sensitivity of the formula was 73.7% and the 
      specificity was 76.7%. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.926, with a 
      sensitivity of 73.7% and a specificity of 93.3%. The STR status was shown to have 
      a certain relationship with the expression of some IHC markers and the level of 
      some tumor markers. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study complement clinical 
      diagnostic criteria and present markers for early prediction of GC and CRC. This 
      approach will aid in improving risk awareness of susceptible individuals and 
      contribute to reducing the incidence of GC and CRC by prevention and early 
      detection.

TI  - Targeting Huntingtin Expression in Patients with Huntington's Disease.
PG  - 2307-2316
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa1900907 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative 
      disease caused by CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in HTT, resulting in a 
      mutant huntingtin protein. IONIS-HTT(Rx) (hereafter, HTT(Rx)) is an antisense 
      oligonucleotide designed to inhibit HTT messenger RNA and thereby reduce 
      concentrations of mutant huntingtin. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, 
      double-blind, multiple-ascending-dose, phase 1-2a trial involving adults with 
      early Huntington's disease. Patients were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to 
      receive HTT(Rx) or placebo as a bolus intrathecal administration every 4 weeks 
      for four doses. Dose selection was guided by a preclinical model in mice and 
      nonhuman primates that related dose level to reduction in the concentration of 
      huntingtin. The primary end point was safety. The secondary end point was HTT(Rx) 
      pharmacokinetics in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Prespecified exploratory end 
      points included the concentration of mutant huntingtin in CSF. RESULTS: Of the 46 
      patients who were enrolled in the trial, 34 were randomly assigned to receive 
      HTT(Rx) (at ascending dose levels of 10 to 120 mg) and 12 were randomly assigned 
      to receive placebo. Each patient received all four doses and completed the trial. 
      Adverse events, all of grade 1 or 2, were reported in 98% of the patients. No 
      serious adverse events were seen in HTT(Rx)-treated patients. There were no 
      clinically relevant adverse changes in laboratory variables. Predose (trough) 
      concentrations of HTT(Rx) in CSF showed dose dependence up to doses of 60 mg. 
      HTT(Rx) treatment resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the concentration of 
      mutant huntingtin in CSF (mean percentage change from baseline, 10% in the 
      placebo group and -20%, -25%, -28%, -42%, and -38% in the HTT(Rx) 10-mg, 30-mg, 
      60-mg, 90-mg, and 120-mg dose groups, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Intrathecal 
      administration of HTT(Rx) to patients with early Huntington's disease was not 
      accompanied by serious adverse events. We observed dose-dependent reductions in 
      concentrations of mutant huntingtin. (Funded by Ionis Pharmaceuticals and F.

TI  - Somatic expansion of the C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat does not occur in ALS 
      spinal cord tissues.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test for somatic C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) and 
      hexanucleotide repeat length instability in the spinal cord of amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis (ALS) cases. METHODS: Whole and partial spinal cords of 19 ALS 
      cases were dissected into transversal sections (5 mm thick). The presence of 
      C9orf72 HRE was tested in each independent section using RepeatPrimed PCR and 
      amplicon-size genotyping. Index measures for the testing of mosaicism were 
      obtained through serial dilutions of genomic DNA from an individual carrying a 
      germline C9orf72 HRE in the genomic DNA of an individual without a C9orf72 HRE. 
      RESULTS: None of the sections examined supported the presence of a subpopulation 
      of cells with a C9orf72 HRE. Moreover, the C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat lengths 
      measured were identical across all the spinal cord sections of each individual 
      patient. CONCLUSIONS: We did not observe somatic instability of the C9orf72 HRE 
      in disease relevant tissues of ALS cases.

TI  - Possible role of androgen receptor gene in therapeutic response of infertile men 
      with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.
PG  - 326-332
LID - 10.1080/19396368.2019.1590478 [doi]
AB  - Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) is defined as a dysfunction of 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, which causes impairments in gametogenesis, 
      pubertal maturation, and/or secretion of the gonadal sex hormones. Human chronic 
      gonadotropin (hCG) stimulates the Leydig cells of the testis to secrete 
      testosterone, which is essential for spermatogenesis. Testosterone replacement 
      therapy is one of the possible options to manage HH treatment. Given the fact 
      that testosterone functions are mediated via androgen receptor (AR), the aim of 
      the present study was to evaluate whether the CAG/GGN triple repeat expansion in 
      AR gene can modulate the response to hCG and testosterone treatment in HH men. 
      Sixty-two men who diagnosed with HH and treated with testosterone and hCG were 
      assessed after treatment. They were classified into two groups, 31 subjects with 
      a positive and 31 subjects with a negative response to replacement therapy within 
      12-18 months. Androgen receptor CAG and GGN repeat numbers were measured in both 
      groups by hot start polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-sequencing technique. 
      Subjects who reached complete spermatogenesis showed the 20 and 23 as the median 
      numbers of AR CAG/GGN repeats, respectively. In individuals who did not respond 
      to treatment the median length for both CAG/GGN repeats were 23. The average of 
      CAG repeats was statistically lower in patients who had the positive response in 
      comparison to patients who did not respond to hormone therapy (p < 0.05), but the 
      length of GGN repeats were not statistically different between these groups of 
      patients (p > 0.05). The number of CAG repeats are negatively and signi fi cantly 
      associated with better hormone therapy response. Our results suggest that the 
      length of CAG repeat polymorphism in AR gene might affect the response to 
      treatment in men suffering from HH, whereas no relationship was found between AR 
      gene GGN repeat polymorphism and testosterone and hCG replacement therapy 
      response. Abbreviations: AR: androgen receptor; FSH: follicle stimulating 
      hormone; Gn: gonadotropins; GnRH: gonadotropin-releasing hormone; hCG: human

AB  - Developing highly active, multivalent ligands as therapeutic agents is 
      challenging because of delivery issues, limited cell permeability, and toxicity. 
      Here, we report intrinsically cell-penetrating multivalent ligands that target 
      the trinucleotide repeat DNA and RNA in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), 
      interrupting the disease progression in two ways. The oligomeric ligands are 
      designed based on the repetitive structure of the target with recognition 
      moieties alternating with bisamidinium groove binders to provide an amphiphilic 
      and polycationic structure, mimicking cell-penetrating peptides. Multiple 
      biological studies suggested the success of our multivalency strategy. The 
      designed oligomers maintained cell permeability and exhibited no apparent 
      toxicity both in cells and in mice at working concentrations. Furthermore, the 
      oligomers showed important activities in DM1 cells and in a DM1 liver mouse 
      model, reducing or eliminating prominent DM1 features. Phenotypic recovery of the 
      climbing defect in adult DM1 Drosophila was also observed. This design strategy 
      should be applicable to other repeat expansion diseases and more generally to 
      DNA/RNA-targeted therapeutics.

TI  - Glutaminase Deficiency Caused by Short Tandem Repeat Expansion in GLS.
PG  - 1433-1441
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa1806627 [doi]
AB  - We report an inborn error of metabolism caused by an expansion of a GCA-repeat 
      tract in the 5' untranslated region of the gene encoding glutaminase (GLS) that 
      was identified through detailed clinical and biochemical phenotyping, combined 
      with whole-genome sequencing. The expansion was observed in three unrelated 
      patients who presented with an early-onset delay in overall development, 
      progressive ataxia, and elevated levels of glutamine. In addition to ataxia, one 
      patient also showed cerebellar atrophy. The expansion was associated with a 
      relative deficiency of GLS messenger RNA transcribed from the expanded allele, 
      which probably resulted from repeat-mediated chromatin changes upstream of the 
      GLS repeat. Our discovery underscores the importance of careful examination of 
      regions of the genome that are typically excluded from or poorly captured by 
      exome sequencing.

TI  - DNA methylation inhibitor attenuates polyglutamine-induced neurodegeneration by 
      regulating Hes5.

LID - e8547
AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a polyglutamine-mediated 
      neuromuscular disease caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the androgen receptor 
      (AR) gene. While transcriptional dysregulation is known to play a critical role 
      in the pathogenesis of SBMA, the underlying molecular pathomechanisms remain 
      unclear. DNA methylation is a fundamental epigenetic modification that silences 
      the transcription of various genes that have a CpG-rich promoter. Here, we showed 
      that DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) is highly expressed in the spinal motor 
      neurons of an SBMA mouse model and in patients with SBMA. Both genetic Dnmt1 
      depletion and treatment with RG108, a DNA methylation inhibitor, ameliorated the 
      viability of SBMA model cells. Furthermore, a continuous intracerebroventricular 
      injection of RG108 mitigated the phenotype of SBMA mice. DNA methylation array 
      analysis identified hairy and enhancer of split 5 (Hes5) as having a CpG island 
      with hyper-methylation in the promoter region, and the Hes5 expression was 
      strongly silenced in SBMA. Moreover, Hes5 over-expression rescued the SBMA cells 
      possibly by inducing Smad2 phosphorylation. Our findings suggest DNA 
      hyper-methylation underlies the neurodegeneration in SBMA.

TI  - Abnormal nuclear aggregation and myotube degeneration in myotonic dystrophy type 
      1.
PG  - 1255-1265
LID - 10.1007/s10072-019-03783-w [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is caused by CTG nucleotide repeat expansions in 
      the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the dystrophia myotonica protein kinase 
      (DMPK) gene. The expanded CTG repeats encode toxic CUG RNAs that cause disease, 
      largely through RNA gain-of-function. DM1 is a fatal disease characterized by 
      progressive muscle wasting, which has no cure. Regenerative medicine has emerged 
      as a promising therapeutic modality for DM1, especially with the advancement of 
      induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell technology and therapeutic genome editing. 
      However, there is an unmet need to identify in vitro outcome measures to 
      demonstrate the therapeutic effects prior to in vivo clinical trials. In this 
      study, we examined the muscle regeneration (myotube formation) in normal and DM1 
      myoblasts in vitro to establish outcome measures for therapeutic monitoring. We 
      found normal proliferation of DM1 myoblasts, but abnormal nuclear aggregation 
      during the early stage myotube formation, as well as myotube degeneration during 
      the late stage of myotube formation. We concluded that early abnormal nuclear 
      aggregation and late myotube degeneration offer easy and sensitive outcome 
      measures to monitor therapeutic effects in vitro.

AB  - Spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion 
      in the androgen receptor gene on the X chromosome. There is a toxic effect of the 
      mutant receptor on muscle and neurons resulting in muscle weakness and atrophy. 
      The weakness can be explained by wasting due to loss of muscle cells, but it is 
      unknown whether weakness also relates to poor muscle contractility of the 
      remaining musculature. In this study, we investigated the muscle contractility in 
      SBMA. We used stationary dynamometry and quantitative MRI to assess muscle 
      strength and absolute and fat-free, cross-sectional areas. Specific muscle force 
      (strength per cross-sectional area) and contractility (strength per fat-free 
      cross-sectional area) were compared with healthy controls and their relation to 
      walking distance and disease severity was investigated. Specific force was 
      reduced by 14-49% in SBMA patients compared to healthy controls. Contractility 
      was reduced by 22-39% in elbow flexion, knee extension, ankle dorsi- and 
      plantarflexion in SBMA patients. The contractility decreased with increasing 
      muscle fat content in muscles with affected contractility in SBMA. The decreased 
      muscle contractility in SBMA may relate to motor neuron degeneration and changed 
      fibre type distribution and muscle architecture.

TI  - Clinical manifestations of homozygote allele carriers in Huntington disease.
PG  - e2101-e2108
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000007147 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Because patients homozygous for Huntington disease (HD) receive the 
      gain-of-function mutation in a double dose, one would expect a more toxic effect 
      in homozygotes than in heterozygotes. Our aim was to investigate the phenotypic 
      differences between homozygotes with both alleles >/=36 CAG repeats and 
      heterozygotes with 1 allele >/=36 CAG repeats. METHODS: This was an international, 
      longitudinal, case-control study (European Huntington's Disease Network Registry 
      database). Baseline and longitudinal total functional capacity, motor, cognitive, 
      and behavioral scores of the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) 
      were compared between homozygotes and heterozygotes. Four-year follow-up data 
      were analyzed using longitudinal mixed-effects models. To estimate the 
      association of age at onset with the length of the shorter and larger allele in 
      homozygotes and heterozygotes, regression analysis was applied. RESULTS: Of 
      10,921 participants with HD (5,777 female [52.9%] and 5,138 male [47.0%]) with a 
      mean age of 55.1 +/- 14.1 years, 28 homozygotes (0.3%) and 10,893 (99.7%) 
      heterozygotes were identified. After correcting for multiple comparisons, 
      homozygotes and heterozygotes had similar age at onset and UHDRS scores and 
      disease progression. In the multivariate linear regression analysis, the longer 
      allele was the most contributing factor to decreased age at HD onset in the 
      homozygotes (p < 0.0001) and heterozygotes (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: CAG repeat 
      expansion on both alleles of the HTT gene is infrequent. Age at onset, HD 
      phenotype, and disease progression do not significantly differ between 
      homozygotes and heterozygotes, indicating similar effect on the mutant protein. 
      CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that age at 
      onset, the motor phenotype and rate of motor decline, and symptoms and signs 
      progression is similar in homozygotes compared to heterozygotes.

TI  - Prevalence of metabolic syndrome and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in a 
      cohort of italian patients with spinal-bulbar muscular atrophy.
PG  - 204-209
AB  - Spinal-bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), is an X-linked motor neuron disease caused 
      by a CAG-repeat expansion in the first exon of the androgen receptor gene (AR) on 
      chromosome X. In SBMA, non-neural clinical phenotype includes disorders of 
      glucose and lipid metabolism. We investigated the prevalence of metabolic 
      syndrome (MS), insulin resistance (IR) and non alcoholic fatty liver disease 
      (NAFLD) in a group of SBMA patients. Forty-seven consecutive patients genetically 
      diagnosed with SBMA underwent biochemical analyses. In 24 patients abdominal 
      sonography examination was performed. Twenty-three (49%) patients had fasting 
      glucose above reference values and 31 (66%) patients had a homeostatic model 
      assessment (HOMA-IR) >/= 2.6. High levels of total cholesterol were found in 24 
      (51%) patients, of LDL-cholesterol in 18 (38%) and of triglycerides in 18 (38%). 
      HDL-cholesterol was decreased in 36 (77%) patients. Twenty-four (55%) subjects 
      had 3 or more criteria of MS. A positive correlation (r = 0.52; p < 0.01) was 
      observed between HOMA-IR and AR-CAG repeat length. AST and ALT were above the 
      reference values respectively in 29 (62%) and 18 (38%) patients. At ultrasound 
      examination increased liver echogenicity was found in 22 patients (92 %). In one 
      patient liver cirrhosis was diagnosed. Liver/kidney ratio of grey-scale 
      intensity, a semi-quantitative parameter of severity of steatosis, strongly 
      correlated with BMI (r = 0.68; p < 0.005). Our study shows a high prevalence of 
      IR, MS and NAFLD in SBMA patients, conditions that increase the cardiovascular 
      risk and can lead to serious liver damage, warranting pharmacological and 
      non-pharmacological treatment.

AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) results from a CAG repeat expansion 
      within the androgen receptor gene (AR). It is unclear why motor neurons 
      selectively degenerate and there are currently no treatments for this 
      debilitating disease. To uncover the causative genes and pathways involved in 
      motor neuron dysfunction, we undertook transcriptomic profiling of primary 
      embryonic motor neurons from SBMA mice. We show that transcriptional 
      dysregulation occurs early during development in SBMA motor neurons. One gene 
      found to be dysregulated, Chmp7, was also altered in vivo in spinal cord before 
      symptom onset in SBMA mice, and crucially in motor neuron precursor cells derived 
      from SBMA patient stem cells, suggesting that Chmp7 may play a causal role in 
      disease pathogenesis by disrupting the endosome-lysosome system. Furthermore, 
      genes were enriched in SBMA motor neurons in several key pathways including p53, 
      DNA repair, WNT and mitochondrial function. SBMA embryonic motor neurons also 
      displayed dysfunctional mitochondria along with DNA damage, possibly resulting 
      from DNA repair gene dysregulation and/or mitochondrial dysfunction. This 
      indicates that a coordinated dysregulation of multiple pathways leads to 
      development of SBMA. Importantly, our findings suggest that the identified 
      pathways and genes, in particular Chmp7, may serve as potential therapeutic 
      targets in SBMA.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is the most common autosomal dominant muscular dystrophy 
      and encompasses both skeletal muscle and cardiac complications. DM is nucleotide 
      repeat expansion disorder in which type 1 (DM1) is due to a trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion on chromosome 19 and type 2 (DM2) arises from a tetranucleotide repeat 
      expansion on chromosome 3. Developing representative models of DM in animals has 
      been challenging due to instability of nucleotide repeat expansions, especially 
      for DM2, which is characterized by nucleotide repeat expansions often greater 
      than 5,000 copies. To investigate mechanisms of human DM, we generated cellular 
      models of DM1 and DM2. We used regulated MyoD expression to reprogram 
      urine-derived cells into myotubes. In this myogenic cell model, we found impaired 
      dystrophin expression, in the presence of muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1) foci, and 
      aberrant splicing in DM1 but not in DM2 cells. We generated induced pluripotent 
      stem cells (iPSC) from healthy controls and DM1 and DM2 subjects, and we 
      differentiated these into cardiomyocytes. DM1 and DM2 cells displayed an increase 
      in RNA foci concomitant with cellular differentiation. iPSC-derived 
      cardiomyocytes from DM1 but not DM2 had aberrant splicing of known target genes 
      and MBNL sequestration. High-resolution imaging revealed tight association 
      between MBNL clusters and RNA foci in DM1. Ca2+ transients differed between DM1- 
      and DM2 iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, and each differed from healthy control 
      cells. RNA-sequencing from DM1- and DM2 iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes revealed 
      distinct misregulation of gene expression, as well as differential aberrant 
      splicing patterns. Together, these data support that DM1 and DM2, despite some 
      shared clinical and molecular features, have distinct pathological signatures.

TI  - Inverse PCR to perform long-distance haplotyping: main applications to improve 
      preimplantation genetic diagnosis in hemophilia.
PG  - 603-611
LID - 10.1038/s41431-018-0334-9 [doi]
AB  - Among other applications of long-distance haplotype phasing in clinical genetics, 
      determination of linked DNA markers as surrogate for problematic structural 
      variants (e.g., repeat-mediated rearrangements) is essential to perform diagnosis 
      from low-quality DNA samples. We describe a next-of-kin-independent (physical) 
      phasing approach based on inverse-PCR (iPCR) paired-end amplification (PI). This 
      method enables typing the multialleles of the short tandem repeat (STR) 
      F8Int21[CA]n at the F8-intron 21, as a surrogate DNA marker for the F8-intron 22 
      inversion (Inv22), the hemophilia A-causative hotspot, within the transmitted 
      haplotype in informative carriers. We provide proof-of-concept by blindly 
      validating the PI approach in 15 carrier mother/affected-son duos. Every 
      F8Int21[CA]n STR allele determined in phase with the Inv22 allele in the female 
      carriers from the informative duos was confirmed in the hemizygous proband 
      (P = 0.00003). A second surrogate STR locus at the F8-IVS22 was obtained by the 
      PI approach improving severe-HA preimplantation genetic diagnosis by augmenting 
      heterozygosity in Inv22 carriers bypassing the requirement for family linkage 
      analysis. The ability of the PI-assay to combine other marker pairs was 
      demonstrated by haplotyping a SNV (F8:c.6118T > C) with a >28kb-distant F8-IVS22 
      STR. The PI approach has proven flexibility to target different marker pairs and 
      has potential for multiplex characterization of iPCR products by massively 
      parallel sequencing.

TI  - Insights into the genetic epidemiology of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy: 
      prevalence estimation and multiple founder haplotypes in the Veneto Italian 
      region.
PG  - 519-524
LID - 10.1111/ene.13850 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Literature data on spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy 
      (SBMA) epidemiology are limited and restricted to specific populations. The aim 
      of our study was to accurately collect information about SBMA patients living in 
      the Veneto region in Italy to compute reliable epidemiological data. Androgen 
      receptor (AR) lineages were genotyped to evaluate the presence of a founder 
      effect. METHODS: A prevalence survey considering all SBMA patients diagnosed in 
      the Italian Veneto region on 31 January 2018 was carried out. The presence of 
      different haplotypes obtained genotyping 15 polymorphic markers (single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms and short tandem repeats) around the AR gene was 
      evaluated. RESULTS: Based on 68 patients, the punctual prevalence of the disease 
      on 31 January 2018 was 2.58/100 000 (95% confidence interval 1.65-3.35) in the 
      male population. Five different haplotypes were identified, confirming the 
      existence of multiple founder effects. It was also observed that, within the same 
      haplotype, patients had a similar CAG repeat number (P-value < 0.001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: A reliable estimation of SBMA prevalence in the Italian Veneto 
      region was calculated which does not seem to be affected by a strong founder 
      effect. Moreover, our data suggest that the length of the CAG expansion could be 
      preserved in patients harbouring the same haplotype.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy is an X-linked neuromuscular 
      disease caused by CAG repeat expansion in the androgen receptor gene. Patients 
      with this disease have low concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-1 
      (IGF-1), and studies of overexpression and administration of IGF-1 showed benefit 
      in a transgenic model; thus the IGF-1 pathway presents as a potential treatment 
      target. We assessed safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of BVS857, an 
      IGF-1 mimetic, in patients with spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy. METHODS: In 
      this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited patients 
      from neuromuscular centres in Denmark (Copenhagen), Germany (Ulm), Italy 
      (Padova), and three sites within the USA (Bethesda, MD; Irvine, CA; and Columbus, 
      OH). Eligible patients were 18 years or older with a confirmed genetic diagnosis 
      of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, were ambulatory, had symptomatic weakness, 
      and had serum IGF-1 concentrations of 170 ng/mL or lower. Patients were randomly 
      assigned (2:1) to study drug or placebo by a number scheme. Patients, 
      investigators, and study personnel were masked to treatment assignment. After a 
      safety and tolerability assessment with eight patients, BVS857 was administered 
      once a week (0.06 mg/kg intravenously) for 12 weeks. Primary outcome measures 
      were safety, tolerability, and the effects of BVS857 on thigh muscle volume (TMV) 
      measured by MRI. The ratio of TMV at day 85 to baseline was analysed with ANCOVA 
      per protocol. Secondary outcomes of muscle strength and function were measured 
      with the Adult Myopathy Assessment Tool, lean body mass through dual energy x-ray 
      absorptiometry, and BVS857 pharmacokinetics. This trial was registered with 
      ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02024932. FINDINGS: 31 patients were assessed for 
      eligibility, 27 of whom were randomly assigned to either BVS857 treatment (n=18) 
      or placebo (n=9), and 24 were included in the preliminary efficacy analysis 
      (BVS857 group, n=15; placebo group, n=9). BVS857 was generally safe with no 
      serious adverse events. No significant differences were found in adverse events 
      between the BVS857 and placebo groups. Immunogenicity was detected in 13 (72%) of 
      18 patients in the BVS857 group, including crossreacting antibodies with 
      neutralising capacity to endogenous IGF-1 in five patients. TMV decreased from 
      baseline to day 85 in the placebo group (-3.4% [-110 cm(3)]) but not in the 
      BVS857 group (0% [2 cm(3)]). A significant difference in change in TMV was 
      observed in the BVS857 group versus the placebo group (geometric-mean ratio 1.04 
      [90% CI 1.01-1.07]; p=0.02). There were no differences between groups in measures 
      of muscle strength and function. INTERPRETATION: TMV remained stable in patients 
      with spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy after being given BVS857 for 12 weeks. 
      The intervention was associated with high incidence of immunogenicity and did not 
      improve muscle strength or function. Additional studies might be needed to assess 
      the efficacy of activating the IGF-1 pathway in this disease. FUNDING: Novartis

AB  - Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O91 has ranked in the top five of 
      the non-O157 serogroups most frequently associated with human cases. In order to 
      gain insight into the genetic diversity of O91 Latin American STEC strains, we 
      analyzed their virulence properties and carried out a subtyping assay. A panel of 
      21 virulence genetic markers associated with human and animal infections was 
      evaluated and the relatedness among strains was determined by a multiple-locus 
      variable-number tandem repeats analysis (MLVA) comprising 9 VNTR loci. Twenty-two 
      STEC O91 isolated from cattle and meat food and belonging to 5 serotypes 
      (O91:H21, O91:H8, O91:H14, O91:H28, O91:H40) were studied. Eight virulence 
      profiles were obtained for the O91 STEC strains: 4 for O91:H21 plus one for 
      O91:H8, O91:H14, O91:H28 and O91:H40. All strains contained ehxA and lpfA(0113) 
      genes and only both stx(1)-positive strains lacked saa, which encodes the STEC 
      autoagglutinating adhesin. Other genes involved in adhesion were detected: ehaA 
      (91%), elfA and espP (86%), ecpA (82%) and, hcpA (77%). The gene encoding the 
      cytolethal distending toxin type-V (CDT-V) was found only in O91:H8 and O91:H21, 
      being present in the majority (89%) of strains of this last serotype. MLVA typing 
      divided the total number of strains into 12 genotypes, and 9 of them were unique 
      to a single strain. No association was observed between the virulence profiles 
      and the source of the strains. Although they lack the eae gene, most of the 
      strains have the genetic potential to adhere to host cells through other 
      structures and possess cdt-V, which has been found in STEC strains involved in 
      serious diseases. The MLVA showed clonal relatedness among strains isolated from 
      cattle belonged to a same dairy farm and suggested that the same clone remains 
      circulating throughout the year and, on the other hand, the need to increase the 
      number of VNTR loci which could allow a higher discrimination among O91:H21 
      isolates.

AB  - Peculiar cognitive profile of patients with SBMA has been described by fragmented 
      literature. Our retrospective study reports the neuropsychological evaluations of 
      a large cohort of patients in order to contribute towards the understanding of 
      this field. We consider 64 neuropsychological evaluations assessing mnesic, 
      linguistic and executive functions collected from 2013 to 2015 in patients 
      attending at Motor Neuron Disease Centre of University of Padova. The battery 
      consisted in: Digit Span forwards and backwards, Prose Memory test, Phonemic 
      Verbal fluency and Trail making tests. ANCOVA statistics were employed to compare 
      tests scores results with those obtained from a sample of healthy control 
      subjects. Multiple linear regressions were used to study the effect on cognitive 
      performance of CAG-repeat expansion, the degree of androgen insensitivity and 
      their interaction to cognitive performance. Statistical analyses did not reveal 
      altered scores in any neuropsychological tests among those adopted. 
      Interestingly, patients performed significantly better in the Prose Memory test's 
      score. No relevant associations were found with genetic, hormonal or clinical 
      patients' profile. Results inconsistent with previous studies have been 
      interpreted according to the phenomenon of somatic mosaicism. We suggest a 
      testosterone-related and the mood state-dependant perspectives as two possible 
      interpretations of the enhanced performances in the Prose Memory test. Further 
      studies employing more datailed tests batteries are encouraged.

      infertile men with abnormal spermogram referred to Royan institute.

AB  - Androgen receptor (AR) mediates androgen activities such as the growth of 
      accessory sex organs, and initiation and promotion of spermatogenesis. There are 
      two trinucleotide polymorphisms (CAG and GGN repeats) in the first exon of AR 
      gene that their association with infertility is still controversial. The variants 
      of both polymorphic repeats were investigated by PCR-Sequencing in 220 infertile 
      men (80 azoospermic, 60 oligospermic and 80 asthenospermic) and 80 healthy 
      fertile controls. AR Expression level was quantified by RT-qPCR on 30 patients 
      (20 patients with nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA) and 10 obstructive azoospermia 
      patients as controls). Our results demonstrated that the medians of CAG and GGN 
      repeats length in infertile group were significantly higher than fertile men 
      (p < 0.05). AR expression results showed a significant increase in SCOS group 
      compared to control (p < 0.05). Long stretches of tandem repeats of AR gene may 
      negatively affect the function of the gene and consequently lead to male 
      infertility. In patients with SCOS, AR expression increases because of the lack 
      of germ cells. Therefore, with increasing AR expression, the probability of SCOS 
      occurrence is also increased. It can be concluded that increasing AR expression 
      in testes tissue decreases the probability of sperm presence.

TI  - Instability of TCF4 Triplet Repeat Expansion With Parent-Child Transmission in 
      Fuchs' Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy.
PG  - 4065-4070
LID - 10.1167/iovs.18-24119 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) caused by the CTG triplet 
      repeat expansion in the TCF4 gene (CTG18.1 locus) is the most common repeat 
      expansion disorder. Intergenerational instability of expanded repeats and 
      clinical anticipation are hallmarks of other repeat expansion disorders. In this 
      study, we examine stability of triplet repeat allele length and FECD disease 
      severity in parent-child transmission of the expanded CTG18.1 allele. METHODS: We 
      studied 44 parent-child transmissions of the mutant expanded CTG18.1 allele from 
      26 FECD families. The CTG18.1 polymorphism was genotyped using short tandem 
      repeat analysis, triplet repeat primed PCR assay, and Southern blot analysis. 
      FECD severity was assessed using modified Krachmer grading (KG) system. Triplet 
      repeat length of mutant allele and KG severity were compared between generations. 
      RESULTS: Instability of the expanded allele was seen in 14 of 44 (31.8%) 
      parent-child transmissions, and the likelihood of an unstable event increased 
      with the size of the parental allele (P = 5.9 x 10;-3). A tendency for 
      contraction was seen in transmission of large alleles (repeat length > 120), 
      whereas intermediate alleles (repeat length between 77 and 120) had predilection 
      for further expansion (P = 1.3 x 10; - 3). Although we noted increased KG 
      severity in the offspring in three pairs, none of these transmissions were 
      associated with allele instability. CONCLUSIONS: We observed instability of the 
      TCF4 triplet repeat expansion in nearly a third of parent-child transmissions. 
      Large mutant CTG18.1 alleles are prone to contraction, whereas intermediate 
      mutant alleles tend to expand when unstably transmitted. Intergenerational 
      instability of TCF4 repeat expansion has implications on FECD disease 
      inheritance.

TI  - Genotyping of Toxoplasma gondii: The advantages of variable number tandem repeats 
      within coding regions.

AB  - Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular protozoan which is widely distributed. 
      Infection occurs as a result of ingestion of uncooked meat and exposure to cat 
      feces. Immunocompetent individuals are generally asymptomatic, while severe 
      disease may occur in immunocompromised subjects and in congenital toxoplasmosis, 
      which is caused by transplacental acquisition of T. gondii. Genetic diversity of 
      T. gondii has often been studied using a PCR-RFLP scheme based on nine molecular 
      markers. These studies led to the description of a clonal population structure 
      with three main lineages (I, II and III) in North America and Europe and higher 
      genetic diversity in South America. The aim of this study was to develop 
      molecular markers that could allow the discrimination of genetic variants within 
      each clonal lineage. We analyzed the genome of T. gondii to identify genes 
      containing variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs). The coding sequences of T. 
      gondii ME49 genome were processed with Tandem Repeat Finder software. A panel of 
      candidate markers was selected based on the following parameters: the repeat unit 
      size (>9...bp) and composition (to avoid single and dinucleotide runs), the number 
      of copies (<20), and the absence of introns within the repeat region. The 
      selected panel of eight molecular markers was analyzed in PRU and RH strains. As 
      a first step, the variability of the sequence size allowed us to differentiate 
      PRU from ME49 (two type II strains) and RH from GT1 (two type I strains). 
      Additionally, amplification products from PRU and RH strains were sequenced to 
      study intra-lineage variability. Aside from size polymorphisms in the 
      amplification products we were able to identify sequence variability in 
      polymorphic markers.

AB  - We investigated the presence of infection by Leptospira spp. in an assembly of 
      Sigmodontinae rodents from the Parana Delta, Argentina. Rodents were captured in 
      places with natural grassland, implanted forest, with and without raising cattle 
      and in sites prone and not prone to flooding. The DNA was amplified from cultured 
      isolates by PCR and Leptospira spp. strains were genotyped using Multiple - Locus 
      Variable Number Tandem Repeat Analysis (MLVA). We isolated Leptospira interrogans 
      serovar Copenhageni from Oligoryzomys nigripes, Leptospira borgpetersenii from 
      Scapteromys aquaticus and Leptospira interrogans serovar Icterohaemorrhagiae from 
      Akodon azarae. The zoonotic Leptospira isolated and genotyped from O. nigripes 
      and S. aquaticus are the first reports from these species. The geographic range 
      of these rodent species include, in addition to Argentina, the countries of 
      Paraguay, Uruguay and Brazil, suggesting that these rodents might be involved in 
      the transmission of spirochetes in other regions. Human and animal health care 
      professionals should be alert to the potential occurrence of leptospirosis in 
      areas where these rodent species are present.

AB  - Cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat expansions in the coding regions of nine 
      polyglutamine (polyQ) genes (HTT, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, ATN1, AR, 
      and TBP) are the cause of several neurodegenerative diseases including 
      Huntington's disease (HD), six different spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, and spinobulbar muscular atrophy. The 
      expanded CAG repeat length in the causative gene is negatively related to the 
      age-at-onset (AAO) of clinical symptoms. In addition to the expanded CAG repeat 
      length in the causative gene, the normal CAG repeats in the other polyQ genes can 
      affect the AAO, suggesting functional interactions between the polyQ genes. 
      However, there is no detailed assessment of the relationships among polyQ genes 
      in pathologically relevant brain regions. We used gene co-expression analysis to 
      study the functional relationships among polyQ genes in different brain regions 
      using the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA), a spatial map of gene expression in the 
      healthy brain. We constructed co-expression networks for seven anatomical brain 
      structures, as well as a region showing a specific pattern of atrophy in HD 
      patients detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. In this 
      HD-associated region, we found that ATN1 and ATXN2 were co-expressed and shared 
      co-expression partners which were enriched for DNA repair genes. We observed a 
      similar co-expression pattern in the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, and striatum in 
      which this relation was most pronounced. Given that the co-expression patterns 
      for these anatomical structures were similar to those for the HD-associated 
      region, our results suggest that their disruption is likely involved in HD 
      pathology. Moreover, ATN1 and ATXN2 also shared many co-expressed genes with HTT, 
      the causative gene of HD, across the brain. Although this triangular relationship 
      among these three polyQ genes may also be dysregulated in other polyQ diseases, 
      stronger co-expression patterns between ATN1 and ATXN2 observed in the 
      HD-associated region, especially in the striatum, may be more specific to HD.

TI  - Fuchs' Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy and RNA Foci in Patients With Myotonic 
      Dystrophy.
PG  - 4579-4585
LID - 10.1167/iovs.17-22350 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The most common cause of Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is 
      an intronic CTG repeat expansion in TCF4. Expanded CUG repeat RNA colocalize with 
      splicing factor, muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1), in nuclear foci in endothelium as a 
      molecular hallmark. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a neuromuscular disorder 
      caused by a CTG repeat expansion in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of DMPK. In 
      this study, we examine for RNA-MBNL1 foci in endothelial cells of FECD subjects 
      with DM1, test the hypothesis that DM1 patients are at risk for FECD, and 
      determine prevalence of TCF4 and DMPK expansions in a FECD cohort. METHODS: Using 
      FISH, we examined for nuclear RNA-MBNL1 foci in endothelial cells from FECD 
      subjects with DM1. We examined 13 consecutive unrelated DM1 patients for FECD 
      using slit-lamp and specular microscopy. We genotyped TCF4 and DMPK repeat 
      polymorphisms in a FECD cohort of 317 probands using short-tandem repeat and 
      triplet repeat-primed PCR assays. RESULTS: We detected abundant nuclear RNA foci 
      colocalizing with MBNL1 in endothelial cells of FECD subjects with DM1. Six of 
      thirteen DM1 patients (46%) had slit-lamp and specular microscopic findings of 
      FECD, compared to 4% disease prevalence (P = 5.5 x 10-6). As expected, 222 out of 
      317 (70%) FECD probands harbored TCF4 expansion, while one subject harbored DMPK 
      expansion without prior diagnosis of DM1. CONCLUSIONS: Our work suggests that DM1 
      patients are at risk for FECD. DMPK mutations contribute to the genetic burden of 
      FECD but are uncommon. We establish a connection between two repeat expansion 
      disorders converging upon RNA-MBNL1 foci and FECD.

TI  - Long-term treatment with leuprorelin for spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy: 
      natural history-controlled study.
PG  - 1026-1032
LID - 10.1136/jnnp-2017-316015 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prognosis and progression of spinal and bulbar 
      muscular atrophy (SBMA), a rare X-linked motor neuron disorder caused by 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion in the AR (androgen receptor) gene, after 
      long-term androgen suppression with leuprorelin acetate treatment. METHODS: In 
      the present natural history-controlled study, 36 patients with SBMA treated with 
      leuprorelin acetate for up to 84 months (leuprorelin acetate-treated group; LT 
      group) and 29 patients with SBMA with no specific treatment (non-treated group; 
      NT group) were analysed. Disease progression was evaluated by longitudinal 
      quantitative assessment of motor functioning using the revised Amyotrophic 
      Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R), and the modified Norris 
      score. In addition, we selected two major clinical endpoint events, namely the 
      occurrence of pneumonia requiring hospitalisation and death, to evaluate disease 
      prognosis following long-term leuprorelin acetate treatment. RESULTS: In our 
      analysis of the longitudinal disease progression using the random slope model, we 
      observed a significant difference in the ALSFRS-R total score, the Limb Norris 
      Score, and the Norris Bulbar Score (p=0.005, 0.026 and 0.020, respectively), with 
      the LT group exhibiting a slower per-12-months decline compared with the NT 
      group. As for the event analysis, the prognosis of the LT group was better in 
      comparison to the NT group as for the event-free survival period (p=0.021). 
      CONCLUSION: Long-term treatment with leuprorelin acetate appears to delay the 
      functional decline and suppress the incidence of pneumonia and death in subjects 
      with SBMA.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence and clinical features of individuals affected 
      by spinocerebellar ataxia 36 (SCA36) at a large tertiary referral center in the 
      United States. METHODS: A total of 577 patients with undiagnosed sporadic or 
      familial cerebellar ataxia comprehensively evaluated at a tertiary referral 
      ataxia center were molecularly evaluated for SCA36. Repeat primed PCR and 
      fragment analysis were used to screen for the presence of a repeat expansion in 
      the NOP56 gene. RESULTS: Fragment analysis of triplet repeat primed PCR products 
      identified a GGCCTG hexanucleotide repeat expansion in intron 1 of NOP56 in 4 
      index cases. These 4 SCA36-positive families comprised 2 distinct ethnic groups: 
      white (European) (2) and Asian (Japanese [1] and Vietnamese [1]). Individuals 
      affected by SCA36 exhibited typical clinical features with gait ataxia and age at 
      onset ranging between 35 and 50 years. Patients also suffered from ataxic or 
      spastic limbs, altered reflexes, abnormal ocular movement, and cognitive 
      impairment. CONCLUSIONS: In a US population, SCA36 was observed to be a rare 
      disorder, accounting for 0.7% (4/577 index cases) of disease in a large 
      undiagnosed ataxia cohort.

TI  - (CCUG)(n) RNA toxicity in a Drosophila model of myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) 
      activates apoptosis.
PG  - 993-1003
LID - 10.1242/dmm.026179 [doi]
AB  - The myotonic dystrophies are prototypic toxic RNA gain-of-function diseases. 
      Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) and type 2 (DM2) are caused by different 
      unstable, noncoding microsatellite repeat expansions - (CTG)(DM1) in DMPK and 
      (CCTG)(DM2) in CNBP Although transcription of mutant repeats into (CUG)(DM1) or 
      (CCUG)(DM2) appears to be necessary and sufficient to cause disease, their 
      pathomechanisms remain incompletely understood. To study the mechanisms of 
      (CCUG)(DM2) toxicity and develop a convenient model for drug screening, we 
      generated a transgenic DM2 model in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster with 
      (CCUG)(n) repeats of variable length (n=16 and 106). Expression of noncoding 
      (CCUG)(106), but not (CCUG)(16), in muscle and retinal cells led to the formation 
      of ribonuclear foci and mis-splicing of genes implicated in DM pathology. 
      Mis-splicing could be rescued by co-expression of human MBNL1, but not by CUGBP1 
      (CELF1) complementation. Flies with (CCUG)(106) displayed strong disruption of 
      external eye morphology and of the underlying retina. Furthermore, expression of 
      (CCUG)(106) in developing retinae caused a strong apoptotic response. Inhibition 
      of apoptosis rescued the retinal disruption in (CCUG)(106) flies. Finally, we 
      tested two chemical compounds that have shown therapeutic potential in DM1 
      models. Whereas treatment of (CCUG)(106) flies with pentamidine had no effect, 
      treatment with a PKR inhibitor blocked both the formation of RNA foci and 
      apoptosis in retinae of (CCUG)(106) flies. Our data indicate that expression of 
      expanded (CCUG)(DM2) repeats is toxic, causing inappropriate cell death in 
      affected fly eyes. Our Drosophila DM2 model might provide a convenient tool for 
      in vivo drug screening.

TI  - Structure and Dynamics of RNA Repeat Expansions That Cause Huntington's Disease 
      and Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1.
PG  - 3463-3474
LID - 10.1021/acs.biochem.7b00252 [doi]
AB  - RNA repeat expansions cause a host of incurable, genetically defined diseases. 
      The most common class of RNA repeats consists of trinucleotide repeats. These 
      long, repeating transcripts fold into hairpins containing 1 x 1 internal loops 
      that can mediate disease via a variety of mechanism(s) in which RNA is the 
      central player. Two of these disorders are Huntington's disease and myotonic 
      dystrophy type 1, which are caused by r(CAG) and r(CUG) repeats, respectively. We 
      report the structures of two RNA constructs containing three copies of a r(CAG) 
      [r(3xCAG)] or r(CUG) [r(3xCUG)] motif that were modeled with nuclear magnetic 
      resonance spectroscopy and simulated annealing with restrained molecular 
      dynamics. The 1 x 1 internal loops of r(3xCAG) are stabilized by one-hydrogen 
      bond (cis Watson-Crick/Watson-Crick) AA pairs, while those of r(3xCUG) prefer 
      one- or two-hydrogen bond (cis Watson-Crick/Watson-Crick) UU pairs. Assigned 
      chemical shifts for the residues depended on the identity of neighbors or next 
      nearest neighbors. Additional insights into the dynamics of these RNA constructs 
      were gained by molecular dynamics simulations and a discrete path sampling 
      method. Results indicate that the global structures of the RNA are A-form and 
      that the loop regions are dynamic. The results will be useful for understanding 
      the dynamic trajectory of these RNA repeats but also may aid in the development 
      of therapeutics.

AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), also known as Kennedy's disease, is a 
      motor neuron disease caused by the expansion of a polymorphic CAG tandem repeat 
      encoding a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the androgen receptor (AR) gene. SBMA 
      is triggered by the binding of mutant AR to its natural ligands, testosterone and 
      dihydrotestosterone (DHT). To investigate the neuronal alterations of motor 
      neuron cell models of SBMA, we applied patch-clamp methods to verify how polyQ 
      expansions in the AR alter cell ionic currents. We used mouse motoneuron-derived 
      MN-1 cells expressing normal AR (MN24Q) and mutant AR (MN100Q treated cells with 
      vehicle EtOH and DHT). We observed a reduction of the current flux mainly at 
      depolarizing potentials in the DHT-treated cells, while the dissection of 
      macroscopic currents showed single different cationic currents belonging to 
      voltage-gated channels. Also, we treated the cells with IGF-1 and PACAP, which 
      have previously been shown to protect MN-1 cells from the toxicity of mutant AR, 
      and we found an amelioration of the altered currents. Our results suggest that 
      the electrophysiological correlate of SBMA is a suitable reference point for the 
      identification of disease symptoms and for future therapeutic targets.

TI  - Combined effect of polymorphisms in type III 5-alpha reductase and androgen receptor 
      gene with the risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia in Korea.
PG  - 504-508
AB  - We evaluated whether type III 5-alpha reductase (SRD5A3; steroid reductase 
      5-alpha 3) polymorphism was associated with susceptibility of benign prostate 
      hyperplasia (BPH) and the combined effects in BPH risk between the type of short 
      tandem repeat (STR) in SRD5A3 and the length of trinucleotide (CAG) repeats in 
      androgen receptor (AR) gene. We compared the length of AC repeats in STR region 
      of SRD5A3 gene and a CAG repeat in AR in 188 BPH patients who underwent 
      transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) and 98 controls by polymerase chain 
      reaction-based methods. We defined short type was less than 21 copies of AC 
      repeats. The odds ratio for BPH between the men with at least one of short type 
      and with both large types of STR in SRD5A3 gene was 3.10 (95% confidence interval 
      [CI], 1.87-5.16; P=0.000). And BPH was 2.35 times more likely to occur in with 
      less than 23 copies of CAG repeats than men equal or greater than 23 copies in AR 
      gene (95% CI, 1.18-2.36; P=0.016). The men with the large type of STR and >/=23 
      copies of CAG repeats have 5.3 times BPH risk compared to the reference group 
      with the at least one of the short type of STR and <23 copies (P<0.000). In 
      conclusion, these results suggest that shorter AC repeats of SRD5A3 gene and 
      shorter CAG repeats of AR gene were associated with an increased risk for BPH. 
      However, the interaction between above two factors was not affected in risk of 
      BPH.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy types 1 (DM1) and 2 (DM2) are autosomal dominant, 
      microsatellite repeat expansion disorders that affect muscle function. Myotonic 
      dystrophy type 1 is caused by CTG repeat expansion in the 3' UTR region of the 
      DMPK gene. Patients with DM2 have expansion of CCTG repeats in intron 1 of the 
      CNBP gene. In this unit, we review and discuss the clinical phenotypes, genetic 
      mutations causing the diseases, and the molecular diagnostic approaches and tools 
      that are used to determine repeat sizes in DM1/2. In summary, the goal of this 
      chapter is to provide the reader with a basic understanding of the clinical, 
      genetic and diagnostic aspects of these disorders. (c) 2016 by John Wiley & Sons,

TI  - Non-Cell-Autonomous Regulation of Retrograde Motoneuronal Axonal Transport in an 
      SBMA Mouse Model.
LID - 10.1523/ENEURO.0062-16.2016 [doi]
LID - ENEURO.0062-16.2016
AB  - Defects in axonal transport are seen in motoneuronal diseases, but how that 
      impairment comes about is not well understood. In spinal bulbar muscular atrophy 
      (SBMA), a disorder linked to a CAG/polyglutamine repeat expansion in the androgen 
      receptor (AR) gene, the disease-causing AR disrupts axonal transport by acting in 
      both a cell-autonomous fashion in the motoneurons themselves, and in a 
      non-cell-autonomous fashion in muscle. The non-cell-autonomous mechanism is 
      suggested by data from a unique "myogenic" transgenic (TG) mouse model in which 
      an AR transgene expressed exclusively in skeletal muscle fibers triggers an 
      androgen-dependent SBMA phenotype, including defects in retrograde transport. 
      However, motoneurons in this TG model retain the endogenous AR gene, leaving open 
      the possibility that impairments in transport in this model also depend on ARs in 
      the motoneurons themselves. To test whether non-cell-autonomous mechanisms alone 
      can perturb retrograde transport, we generated male TG mice in which the 
      endogenous AR allele has the testicular feminization mutation (Tfm) and, 
      consequently, is nonfunctional. Males carrying the Tfm allele alone show no 
      deficits in motor function or axonal transport, with or without testosterone 
      treatment. However, when Tfm males carrying the myogenic transgene (Tfm/TG) are 
      treated with testosterone, they develop impaired motor function and defects in 
      retrograde transport, having fewer retrogradely labeled motoneurons and deficits 
      in endosomal flux based on time-lapse video microscopy of living axons. These 
      findings demonstrate that non-cell-autonomous disease mechanisms originating in 
      muscle are sufficient to induce defects in retrograde transport in motoneurons.

TI  - Characterisation of Clostridium difficile strains isolated from Groote Schuur 
      Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa.
PG  - 1709-18

AB  - The C. difficile infection rate in South Africa is concerning. Many strains 
      previously isolated from diarrhetic patients at Groote Schuur Hospital were 
      ribotype 017. This study further characterised these strains with respect to 
      their clonal relationships, antibiotic susceptibility, toxin production and 
      various attributes impacting on pathogen colonisation. Multilocus variable-number 
      tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) was used to characterise all C. difficile isolates. 
      Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by E-test and PCR-based analysis of the 
      ermB, gyrA and gyrB genes. Auto-aggregation of cells was measured in broth, and 
      biofilm formation observed in 24-well plates. Toxins were measured using the 
      Wampole C DIFF TOX A/B II kit. Most isolates belonged to the ribotype 017 group. 
      Identical MLVA types occurred in different wards over time, and several patients 
      were infected with identical strains. All isolates were susceptible to vancomycin 
      and metronidazole, but some ribotype 017 isolates showed reduced metronidazole 
      susceptibility (>/=2 mg l(-1)). Sixty-nine percent of ribotype 017 isolates were 
      resistant to moxifloxacin, and 94 % to erythromycin, compared to 0 % and 17 % 
      resistance, respectively, in non-ribotype 017 isolates. The ermB gene and 
      mutations in the gyrA and/or gyrB genes were linked to erythromycin and 
      moxifloxacin resistance, respectively. Ribotype 017 isolates auto-aggregated more 
      strongly than other isolates and produced lower levels of the TcdB toxin than a 
      reference strain. Certain strains produced strong biofilms. Patient-to-patient 
      transfer and unique infection events could cause the predominance of ribotype 017 
      strains in the cohort. Multi-drug resistant strains are a potential reservoir for 
      future infections.

TI  - A Potent Inhibitor of Protein Sequestration by Expanded Triplet (CUG) Repeats 
      that Shows Phenotypic Improvements in a Drosophila Model of Myotonic Dystrophy.
PG  - 1428-35
LID - 10.1002/cmdc.201600081 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy is the most common form of adult-onset muscular dystrophy, 
      originating in a CTG repeat expansion in the DMPK gene. The expanded CUG 
      transcript sequesters MBNL1, a key regulator of alternative splicing, leading to 
      the misregulation of numerous pre-mRNAs. We report an RNA-targeted agent as a 
      possible lead compound for the treatment of myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) that 
      reveals both the promise and challenges for this type of small-molecule approach. 
      The agent is a potent inhibitor of the MBNL1-rCUG complex with an inhibition 
      constant (Ki ) of 25+/-8 nm, and is also relatively nontoxic to HeLa cells, able to 
      dissolve nuclear foci, and correct the insulin receptor splicing defect in DM1 
      model cells. Moreover, treatment with this compound improves two separate disease 
      phenotypes in a Drosophila model of DM1: adult external eye degeneration and 
      larval crawling defect. However, the compound has a relatively low maximum 
      tolerated dose in mice, and its cell uptake may be limited, providing insight 
      into directions for future development.

TI  - Hypospadias as a novel feature in spinal bulbar muscle atrophy.
PG  - 703-6
LID - 10.1007/s00415-016-8038-y [doi]
AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscle atrophy (SBMA) is an X-linked neuromuscular disorder 
      caused by CAG repeat expansions in the androgen receptor (AR) gene. The SBMA 
      phenotype consists of slowly progressive neuromuscular symptoms and 
      undermasculinization features as the result of malfunction of the AR. The latter 
      mainly includes gynecomastia and infertility. Hypospadias is also a feature of 
      undermasculinization with an underdeveloped urethra and penis; it has not been 
      described as part of the SBMA phenotype but has been suggested to be associated 
      with a prolonged CAG repeat in the AR gene. This study includes the first 
      epidemiologic description of the co-occurrence of hypospadias and SBMA in 
      subjects and their male relatives in Swedish population-based health registers, 
      as well as an additional clinical case. One boy with severe hypospadias was 
      screened for mutations in the AR gene and was found to have 42 CAG repeats in it, 
      which is in the full range of mutations causing SBMA later in life. We also 
      detected a maximum of four cases displaying the combination of SBMA and 
      hypospadias in our national register databases. This is the third case report 
      with hypospadias in association with CAG repeat expansions in the AR gene in the 
      full range known to cause SBMA later in life. Our findings suggest that 
      hypospadias may be an under diagnosed feature of the SBMA phenotype and we 
      propose that neurologists working with SBMA further investigate and report the 
      true prevalence of hypospadias among patients with SBMA.

TI  - Clonality assessment of adenomatoid tumor supports its neoplastic nature.
PG  - 88-94

LID - 10.1016/j.humpath.2015.09.032 [doi]
AB  - Adenomatoid tumor is a relatively rare disease that predominantly involves male 
      and female internal genital tracts. Although its clinical and pathologic features 
      are well characterized, there is still controversy regarding its nature as a true 
      neoplasm or a variant of mesothelial hyperplasia of a reactive nature. We sought 
      to resolve this debate by investigating the clonality of uterine adenomatoid 
      tumor from 13 female cases. The mesothelial cells and surrounding normal 
      myometrium were precisely harvested using laser capture microdissection, and 
      genomic DNA was extracted for clonal analysis by assessing the patterns of 
      X-chromosome inactivation. Fluorescent polymerase chain reaction amplification of 
      a highly polymorphic short tandem repeat of the human androgen receptor (HUMARA) 
      gene with and without methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease HpaII 
      digestion was performed on DNA extracted from mesothelial cells, using normal 
      myometrium and male blood sample as controls. Of the 13 cases successfully 
      amplified, all 10 informative cases showed concordant nonrandom X-chromosome 
      inactivation pattern consistent with monoclonality. In comparison, surrounding 
      normal myometrium showed a polyclonal pattern of X-chromosome inactivation, and 
      male blood sample failed to be amplified after HpaII treatment. Our results 
      demonstrate that adenomatoid tumor is a monoclonal disease favoring a neoplastic 
      process. This neoplastic rather than reactive nature probably accounts for its 
      frequently observed infiltrative growth pattern and the occurrence of diffuse 
      adenomatoid tumor, especially when host immunity is compromised. Additional 
      studies with larger sample sizes will be needed to conclusively prove our 
      conclusion.

AB  - We have recently described a severe haemophilia A and moyamoya (SHAM) syndrome 
      caused by Xq28 deletions encompassing F8 and the BRCC3 familial moyamoya gene. 
      The phenotype includes haemophilia A, moyamoya angiopathy, dysmorphia and 
      hypertension. The genetic analysis of the family of our SHAM patient demonstrated 
      carrier state in proband's mother and sister. The patient's mother is apparently 
      well, whereas his currently 18-years-old sister presents with mild haemophilia A, 
      coarctation of the aorta, hypertension, and ventricular arrhythmia. We performed 
      X chromosome inactivation assay based on HpaII methylation analysis of a 
      polymorphic short tandem repeat (STR) in the X linked AR (androgen receptor) gene 
      and used quantitative real-time RT PCR to measure the expression of genes from 
      the deleted region in proband's family members. We found an extremely skewed X 
      chromosome inactivation pattern in the female members of the family leading to 
      preferential inactivation of the X chromosome without Xq28 deletion in patient's 
      sister. We demonstrated differential expression of the genes from the deleted 
      region in four members of the family, that tightly correlates with the clinical 
      features. In conclusion, we show that the haematologic and cardiovascular 
      morbidity and the discrepancy between patient's sister and mother despite the 
      same genetic lesion are due to skewed X chromosome inactivation leading to 
      clinically relevant differential expression of SHAM syndrome genes. This report 
      highlights the role for BRCC3 in cardiovascular physiology and disease, and 
      demonstrates that in some complex hereditary syndromes full diagnostics may 
      require the examination of both genetic and epigenetic events.

TI  - Characterization of a novel metastatic prostate cancer cell line of LNCaP origin.
PG  - 215-25
LID - 10.1002/pros.23115 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The LNCaP cell line was originally isolated from the lymph node of a 
      patient with metastatic prostate cancer. Many cell lines have been derived from 
      LNCaP by selective pressures to study different aspects of prostate cancer 
      progression. When injected subcutaneously into male athymic nude mice, LNCaP and 
      its derivatives rarely metastasize. METHODS: Here, we describe the 
      characteristics of a new LNCaP derivative, JHU-LNCaP-SM, which was generated by 
      long term passage in normal cell culture conditions. RESULTS: Short tandem repeat 
      (STR) analysis and genomic sequencing verified JHU-LNCaP-SM derivation from 
      parental LNCaP cells. JHU-LNCaP-SM cells express the same mutated androgen 
      receptor (AR) but unlike LNCaP, are no longer androgen dependent for growth. The 
      cells demonstrate an attenuated androgen responsiveness in transcriptional assays 
      and retain androgen sensitive expression of PSA, AR, and PSMA. Unlike parental 
      LNCaP, JHU-LNCaP-SM cells quickly form subcutaneous tumors in male athymic nude 
      mice, reliably metastasize to the lymph nodes and display a striking 
      intra-tumoral and spreading hemorrhagic phenotype as tumor xenografts. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The JHU-LNCaP-SM cell line is a new isolate of LNCaP, which 
      facilitates practical, preclinical studies of spontaneous metastasis of prostate 
      cancer through lymphatic tissues.

TI  - Molecular analysis of ovarian mucinous carcinoma reveals different cell of 
      origins.
PG  - 22949-58
AB  - It is believed that a subset of primary ovarian mucinous tumors is derived from 
      mature teratomas [1-5]. To confirm this, we performed microsatellite genotyping 
      using a variety of short tandem repeat makers and analyzed allelotypes of 8 
      mucinous tumors (4 mucinous carcinomas, 3 atypical proliferative mucinous tumors 
      and 1 mucinous cystadenoma) associated with a teratoma to determine whether they 
      were clonally related. 7 of the 8 mucinous tumors showed complete or a high 
      degree of homozygosity. Among the 6 pairs of tumors with teratoma tissue 
      available for comparison, 5 of 6 showed a high or complete degree of allelotypes 
      matching, which differed from the somatic allelotypes of the normal control 
      tissue. A discrepancy was detected between carcinoma and teratoma in one pair at 
      several loci, with different X-chromosome inactivation patterns revealed by the 
      HUMARA clonality assay. We also investigated the allelotypes of 16 ovarian 
      mucinous carcinomas without a teratoma in young patients (range 13-30) and in 6 
      older patients (range 40-67) using the same method. None of these tumors showed 
      pure homozygosity. The number of homozygous loci in this cohort was significantly 
      lower than that in the first. Our results suggest first, that most mucinous 
      tumors associated with a teratoma are derived from the teratoma but occasionally 
      they could be collision tumors and second that the majority of pure mucinous 
      tumors in young women in whom a teratoma is not present are not derived from a 
      teratoma.

TI  - Androgen receptor (CAG)n polymorphisms and breast cancer risk in a Han Chinese 
      population.
PG  - 10258-66
LID - 10.4238/2015.August.28.10 [doi]
AB  - The androgen receptor (AR) is involved in the differentiation and growth of 
      breast cancer. Genetic markers in the AR gene have a plausible role in modulating 
      the risk of breast cancer. In this study, we studied the association of breast 
      cancer and the trinucleotide repeat polymorphism (CAG)n in exon 1 of the AR gene 
      in 202 patients with breast cancer and 183 healthy controls from our hospital 
      (Yinchuan, China). Repeat lengths were determined by fluorescent DNA fragment 
      analysis using the ABI GeneScan software and DNA sequencing. We detected 17 short 
      tandem repeat alleles in exon 1 in the Han population of Ningxia Province, China. 
      The CAG repeat number ranged from 14 to 31 and the frequency ranged from 0.339 to 
      24.460%. Generally, (CAG)n repeat lengths <22 were classified as short (S), and 
      those >22 were classified as long (L). No association was found between breast 
      cancer and the S/L (CAG) variants. However, the frequency of the (CAG)25 repeats 
      in the breast cancer group was significantly higher than that in the control 
      group (P = 0.033, odds ratio = 1.790, 95% confidence interval = 1.044-3.069). 
      These findings indicate a role for AR gene (CAG)n variations in breast cancer and 
      might be informative for future genetic or biological studies on breast cancer, 
      although these findings need replication in other populations.

TI  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A: Co-existence 
      of two rare neuromuscular genetic diseases in the same patient.
PG  - 800-1

LID - 10.1016/j.nmd.2015.07.015 [doi]
AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy is an X-linked neuromuscular disease caused by 
      a trinucleotide CAG repeat expansion in the androgen receptor gene; it is 
      clinically characterized by adult-onset, slowly progressive weakness and atrophy 
      mainly affecting proximal limb and bulbar muscles. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 
      type 1A is an autosomal dominant polyneuropathy due to peripheral myelin protein 
      22 gene duplication and characterized by slowly progressive distal limb muscle 
      weakness, atrophy and sensory loss with foot deformities. Here we report the 
      co-occurrence of both neuromuscular genetic diseases in the same male patient. 
      Difficulties in climbing stairs and jaw weakness were presenting symptoms 
      consistent with SBMA. However, predominant distal weakness and bilateral pes

      two diseases, even if extremely rare, should be considered in the presence of 
      atypical symptoms; in the case of genetic diseases this event may have important 
      implications on family members' counseling.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), also called Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), 
      is one of the most common SCAs worldwide and caused by a CAG repeat expansion 
      located in ATXN3 gene. Based on the CAG repeat numbers, alleles of ATXN3 can be 
      divided into normal alleles (ANs), intermediate alleles (AIs) and expanded 
      alleles (AEs). It was controversial whether the frequency of large normal alleles 
      (large ANs) is related to the prevalence of SCA3 or not. And there were huge 
      chaos in the comprehension of the specific numbers of the range of CAG repeats 
      which is fundamental for genetic analysis of SCA3. To illustrate these issues, we 
      made a novel CAG repeat ladder to detect CAG repeats of ATXN3 in 1003 unrelated 
      Chinese normal individuals and studied haplotypes defined by three single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) closed to ATXN3. We found that the number of CAG 
      repeats ranged from 13 to 49, among them, 14 was the most common number. Positive 
      skew, the highest frequency of large ANs and 4 AIs which had never been reported 
      before were found. Also, AEs and large ANs shared the same haplotypes defined by 
      the SNPs. Based on these data and other related studies, we presumed that de novo 
      mutations of ATXN3 emerging from large ANs are at least one survival mechanisms 
      of mutational ATXN3 and we can redefine the range of CAG repeats as: ANs</=44, 45 
      </=AIs </=49 and AEs>/=50.

AB  - For some neurological disorders, disease is primarily RNA mediated due to 
      expression of non-coding microsatellite expansion RNAs (RNA(exp)). Toxicity is 
      thought to result from enhanced binding of proteins to these expansions and 
      depletion from their normal cellular targets. However, experimental evidence for 
      this sequestration model is lacking. Here, we use HITS-CLIP and pre-mRNA 
      processing analysis of human control versus myotonic dystrophy (DM) brains to 
      provide compelling evidence for this RNA toxicity model. MBNL2 binds directly to 
      DM repeat expansions in the brain, resulting in depletion from its normal RNA 
      targets with downstream effects on alternative splicing and polyadenylation. 
      Similar RNA processing defects were detected in Mbnl compound-knockout mice, 
      highlighted by dysregulation of Mapt splicing and fetal tau isoform expression in 
      adults. These results demonstrate that MBNL proteins are directly sequestered by 
      RNA(exp) in the DM brain and introduce a powerful experimental tool to evaluate 
      RNA-mediated toxicity in other expansion diseases.

AB  - Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) form calcium release channels located in the membranes 
      of the sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum. RyRs play a major role in 
      excitation-contraction coupling and other Ca(2+)-dependent signalling events, and 
      consist of several globular domains that together form a large assembly. Here we 
      describe the crystal structures of the SPRY1 and tandem-repeat domains at 
      1.2-1.5 A resolution, which reveal several structural elements not detected in 
      recent cryo-EM reconstructions of RyRs. The cryo-EM studies disagree on the 
      position of SPRY domains, which had been proposed based on homology modelling. 
      Computational docking of the crystal structures, combined with FRET studies, show 
      that the SPRY1 domain is located next to FK506-binding protein (FKBP). Molecular 
      dynamics flexible fitting and mutagenesis experiments suggest a hydrophobic 
      cluster within SPRY1 that is crucial for FKBP binding. A RyR1 disease mutation, 
      N760D, appears to directly impact FKBP binding through interfering with SPRY1 
      folding.

AB  - In humans, neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington's disease (HD) and many 
      spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) have been found to be associated with CAG 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion. An important RNA-mediated mechanism that causes 
      these diseases involves the binding of the splicing regulator protein MBNL1 
      (Muscleblind-like 1 protein) to expanded r(CAG) repeats. Moreover, mutant 
      huntingtin protein translated from expanded r(CAG) also yields toxic effects. To 
      discern the role of mutant RNA in these diseases, it is essential to gather 
      information about its structure. Detailed insight into the different structures 
      and conformations adopted by these mutant transcripts is vital for developing 
      therapeutics targeting them. Here, we report the crystal structure of an RNA 
      model with a r(CAG) motif, which is complemented by an NMR-based solution 
      structure obtained from restrained Molecular Dynamics (rMD) simulation studies. 
      Crystal structure data of the RNA model resolved at 2.3 A reveals non-canonical 
      pairing of adenine in 5 -CAG/3 -GAC motif samples in different syn and anti 
      conformations. The overall RNA structure has helical parameters intermediate to 
      the A- and B-forms of nucleic acids due to the global widening of major grooves 
      and base-pair preferences near internal AA loops. The comprehension of structural 
      behaviour by studying the spectral features and the dynamics also supports the 
      flexible nature of the r(CAG) motif.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a disease characterized by errors in 
      alternative splicing, or "mis-splicing". The causative agent of mis-splicing in 
      DM1 is an inherited CTG repeat expansion located in the 3' untranslated region of 
      the DM protein kinase gene. When transcribed, CUG repeat expansion RNA sequesters 
      muscleblind-like (MBNL) proteins, which constitute an important family of 
      alternative splicing regulators. Sequestration of MBNL proteins results in the 
      mis-splicing of its regulated transcripts. Previous work has demonstrated that 
      pentamidine, a diamidine which is currently FDA-approved as an antiparasitic 
      agent, was able to partially reverse mis-splicing in multiple DM1 models, albeit 
      at toxic concentrations. In this study, we characterized a series of pentamidine 
      analogues to determine their ability to reverse mis-splicing and their toxicity 
      in vivo. Experiments in cell and mouse models demonstrated that compound 13, also 
      known as furamidine, effectively reversed mis-splicing with equal efficacy and 
      reduced toxicity compared to pentamidine.

AB  - Disorders of sex development (DSD) affect the development of chromosomal, gonadal 
      and/or anatomical sex. We analyzed a patient with ambiguous genitalia aiming to 
      correlate the genetic findings with the phenotype. Blood and tissue samples from 
      a male patient with penoscrotal hypospadias were analyzed by 
      immunohistochemistry, karyotyping and FISH. DNA was sequenced for the AR, SRY and 
      DHH genes, and further 26 loci in different sex chromosomes were analyzed by 
      MLPA. The gonosomal origin was evaluated by simple tandem repeat (STR) analysis 
      and SNP array. Histopathology revealed a streak gonad, a fallopian tube and a 
      rudimentary uterus, positive for placental alkaline phosphatase, cytokeratin-7 
      and c-kit, and negative for estrogen, androgen and progesterone receptors, 
      alpha-inhibin, alpha-1-fetoprotein, beta-hCG, and oct-4. Karyotyping showed a 
      45,X/46,XY mosaicism, yet FISH showed both 46,XX/46,XY mosaicism (gonad and 
      urethral plate), 46,XX (uterus and tube) and 46,XY karyotypes (rudimentary 
      testicular tissue). DNA sequencing revealed intact sequences in SOX9, WNT4, 
      NR0B1, NR5A1, CYP21A2, SRY, AR, and DHH. STR analysis showed only one maternal 
      allele for all X chromosome markers (uniparental isodisomy, UPD), with a weaker 
      SRY signal and a 4:1 ratio in the X:Y signal. Our findings suggest that the 
      observed complex DSD phenotype is the result of somatic gonosomal mosaicism and 
      UPD despite a normal blood karyotype. The presence of UPD warrants adequate 
      genetic counseling for the family and frequent, lifelong, preventive follow-up 
      controls in the patient.

AB  - The estrogen receptors (ESRalpha and beta) and the androgen receptor (AR) mediate 
      genomic and non-genomic effects on breast tumor growth and proliferation. We 
      analyzed 101 breast cancer patients for allelic loss in microsatellites located 
      in regulatory regions of the ESRs and AR genes in breast cancer tumors. The loss 
      of heterozygosity (LOH) at these loci was found in 36.2% of tumor tissues (ductal 
      carcinoma cases), for 19% of cases at the ESRalpha locus, for 16% at the ESRbeta locus, 
      and for 10% at the AR locus. The LOH in at least one of the two ESR loci was 
      correlated to poor prognosis criteria: ESR-negative status (P = 0.007), 
      PR-negative status (P = 0.003), high Scarff-Bloom-Richardson (SBR) grade 
      (P = 0.0007), high MIB-1 proliferation index (P = 0.02), and diminished apoptosis 
      potential (TP53-positive status, P = 0.018). When AR was also considered, the LOH 
      in at least one of the three loci was associated with ESR-negative status 
      (P = 0.036), PR-negative status (P = 0.027), high SBR grade (P = 0.005), high 
      mitotic index (P = 0.0002), TP53-positive status (P = 0.029), and proliferating 
      index (high MIB-1, P = 0.03). Allelic loss was observed in 26% of normal tissue 
      adjacent to tumor with LOH at the ESRalpha locus and in 7.1% of tumors with LOH at 
      the ESRbeta locus. The LOH in tumor tissue in the regulatory regions of ESRalpha, ESRbeta, 
      and AR genes has potentially synergistic effects on tumor proliferation, 
      histological aggressiveness, down-regulation of ESRalpha and progesterone receptor 
      (PR) genes, and is an early genetic alteration in cancer that is possibly 
      involved in passage to estrogen independence.

AB  - Meat of bovine origin is one of the major vehicles in the transmission of 
      verotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC) to human consumers. This pathogen can 
      produce serious human illness, including bloody diarrhea and hemolytic uremic 
      syndrome. The aim of the current study was to characterize E. coli isolates 
      (mainly VTEC strains) belonging to several serotypes in samples from cattle 
      carcasses and feces of three municipal slaughter plants from Mexico State. The 
      genetic diversity and molecular relatedness among the isolates was evaluated with 
      multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). To our knowledge, 
      and with the exception of E. coli O157:H7, this is the first time that serotypes 
      analyzed here have been subtyped by MLVA in Mexico. MLVA typing grouped the 37 
      strains from this study into 30 distinct genotypes, 26 of which were unique. 
      These findings indicate that cattle carcasses and feces from slaughter plants in 
      Mexico are a source of VTEC that are genetically diverse in terms of serotypes 
      and virulence profiles. The presence of these pathogens in carcasses indicates 
      the high probability of the spread of VTEC strains during slaughter and 
      processing.

TI  - Morphological changes of skeletal muscle in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy 
      (SBMA), Kennedy's disease: a case report.
PG  - 199-206
LID - 10.5414/NP300829 [doi]
AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA, Kennedy's disease) is an X-linked 
      recessive disease affecting lower motor neurons. In the present case report, we 
      describe morphological changes in a muscle biopsy obtained from a 62-year-old 
      patient with gynecomastia and with the following neurological symptoms: 
      dysphagia, dysarthria, wasting and fasciculation of the tongue, proximal 
      weakness, fasciculations in the limb muscles, and an absence of all tendon 
      reflexes. Neurogenic alternations were predominantly observed using light and 
      electron microscopy. The angulated atrophic muscle fibers formed bundles. The 
      numerous nuclei were pyknotic or pale, some of them were also ubiquitin positive; 
      they were grouped inside so-called "nuclear sacks". At the ultrastructural level, 
      atrophic muscle fibers revealed disruption and loss of sarcomeres, duplication of 
      Z-line, and rod-like structures. The nuclei, often with irregular shapes, 
      revealed varying degrees of chromatin condensation, from dispersed to highly 
      condensed, like pyknotic nuclei. Occasionally electron-dense inclusions in the 
      nuclei were found. Some myogenic features like hypertrophic muscle fibers and 
      proliferation of connective tissue were also visible. The neurogenic and myogenic 
      pathological changes suggested SBMA, which was confirmed with genetic analysis 
      (trinucleotide CAG (glutamie)-repeat expansion in the androgen-receptor gene).

AB  - The molecular background of disorders of sex development (DSD) in cats is poorly 
      recognized. In this study we present cytogenetic, molecular and histological 
      analyses of four cats subjected for the analysis due to ambiguous external 
      genitalia. Three cases, with rudimentary penises and an abnormal position of the 
      urethral orifice, represented different types of hypospadias. The fourth case had 
      a normal penis, a blind vulva and spermatogenetically active testes. Histological 
      studies showed structures typical of testes, but spermatogenic activity was 
      observed in two cats only. All the cats had a normal male chromosome complement 
      (38,XY) and the Y-chromosome linked genes (SRY and ZFY) were also detected. 
      Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), with the use of the feline BAC probe 
      harboring the SRY gene, excluded the possibility of chromosome translocation of 
      the Y chromosome fragment carrying the SRY gene onto another chromosome. 
      Sequencing of four candidate genes (SRY--sex determining region Y; AR--androgen 
      receptor; SRD5A2--steroid-5-alfa reductase 2 and MAMLD1--mastermind-like domain 
      containing (1) revealed one SNP in the SRY gene, one common polymorphism in exon 
      1 of the AR gene (tandem repeat of a tri-nucleotide motif--CAG), six 
      polymorphisms (5 SNPs and 1 indel) in the SRD5A2 gene and one SNP in the MAMLD1 
      gene. Molecular studies of the candidate genes showed no association with the 
      identified polymorphisms, thus molecular background of the studied DSD phenotypes 
      remains unknown.

AB  - Leptospirosis is an infectious disease of wide global distribution, which is 
      endemic in Argentina. The objective of this study was to obtain the genetic 
      profiles of Leptospira spp. strains isolated from clinical cases of dogs in the 
      province of Buenos Aires by the multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat 
      analysis (MLVA). Eight isolated canine strains were genotyped by MLVA, obtaining 
      the identical profile of Leptospira interrogans serovar Canicola Hond Utrecht IV 
      in the strains named Dogy and Mayo. The strains named Bel, Sarmiento, La Plata 
      4581 and La Plata 5478 were identical to the profile of the genotype of L. 
      interrogans serovar Portlandvere MY 1039.The strain named Avellaneda was 
      identical to the genotype profile of L. interrogans serovar Icterohaemorrhagiae 
      RGA and the strain named SB had the same profile as the L. interrogans serovar 
      Pomona Baires genotype and was similar to the profile of serovar Pomona Pomona 
      genotype. It would be useful to include a larger number of isolates from 
      different dog populations in various provinces of Argentina and to characterize 
      the genetic profiles of the strains circulating in the country. The information 
      obtained will be useful for the control of leptospirosis in the dog population.

TI  - Modifications to toxic CUG RNAs induce structural stability, rescue mis-splicing 
      in a myotonic dystrophy cell model and reduce toxicity in a myotonic dystrophy 
      zebrafish model.
PG  - 12768-78

AB  - CUG repeat expansions in the 3' UTR of dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) 
      cause myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). As RNA, these repeats elicit toxicity by 
      sequestering splicing proteins, such as MBNL1, into protein-RNA aggregates. 
      Structural studies demonstrate that CUG repeats can form A-form helices, 
      suggesting that repeat secondary structure could be important in pathogenicity. 
      To evaluate this hypothesis, we utilized structure-stabilizing RNA modifications 
      pseudouridine (Psi) and 2'-O-methylation to determine if stabilization of CUG 
      helical conformations affected toxicity. CUG repeats modified with Psi or 
      2'-O-methyl groups exhibited enhanced structural stability and reduced affinity 
      for MBNL1. Molecular dynamics and X-ray crystallography suggest a potential 
      water-bridging mechanism for Psi-mediated CUG repeat stabilization. Psi modification 
      of CUG repeats rescued mis-splicing in a DM1 cell model and prevented CUG repeat 
      toxicity in zebrafish embryos. This study indicates that the structure of toxic 
      RNAs has a significant role in controlling the onset of neuromuscular diseases.

TI  - Synergic prodegradative activity of Bicalutamide and trehalose on the mutant 
      androgen receptor responsible for spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.
PG  - 64-75
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddu419 [doi]
AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an X-linked motoneuron disease due 
      to a CAG triplet-repeat expansion in the androgen receptor (AR) gene, which is 
      translated into an elongated polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in AR protein (ARpolyQ). 
      ARpolyQ toxicity is activated by the AR ligand testosterone (or 
      dihydrotestosterone), and the polyQ triggers ARpolyQ misfolding and aggregation 
      in spinal cord motoneurons and muscle cells. In motoneurons, testosterone 
      triggers nuclear toxicity by inducing AR nuclear translocation. Thus, (i) 
      prevention of ARpolyQ nuclear localization, combined with (ii) an increased 
      ARpolyQ cytoplasmic clearance, should reduce its detrimental activity. Using the 
      antiandrogen Bicalutamide (Casodex((R))), which slows down AR activation and 
      nuclear translocation, and the disaccharide trehalose, an autophagy activator, we 
      found that, in motoneurons, the two compounds together reduced ARpolyQ insoluble 
      forms with higher efficiency than that obtained with single treatments. The 
      ARpolyQ clearance was mediated by trehalose-induced autophagy combined with the 
      longer cytoplasmic retention of ARpolyQ bound to Bicalutamide. This allows an 
      increased recognition of misfolded species by the autophagic system prior to 
      their migration into the nucleus. Interestingly, the combinatory use of trehalose 
      and Bicalutamide was also efficient in the removal of insoluble species of AR 
      with a very long polyQ (Q112) tract, which typically aggregates into the cell 
      nuclei. Collectively, these data suggest that the combinatory use of Bicalutamide 
      and trehalose is a novel approach to facilitate ARpolyQ clearance that has to be 
      tested in other cell types target of SBMA (i.e. muscle cells) and in vivo in 
      animal models of SBMA.

AB  - X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) is the epigenetic transcriptional silencing of an 
      X-chromosome during the early stages of embryonic development in female eutherian 
      mammals. XCI assures monoallelic expression in each cell and compensation for 
      dosage-sensitive X-linked genes between females (XX) and males (XY). DNA 
      methylation at the carbon-5 position of the cytosine pyrimidine ring in the 
      context of a CpG dinucleotide sequence (5meCpG) in promoter regions is a key 
      epigenetic marker for transcriptional gene silencing. Using computational 
      analysis, we revealed an extragenic tandem GAAA repeat 230-bp from the landmark 
      CpG island of the human X-linked retinitis pigmentosa 2 RP2 promoter whose 5meCpG 
      status correlates with XCI. We used this RP2 onshore tandem GAAA repeat to 
      develop an allele-specific 5meCpG-based PCR assay that is highly concordant with 
      the human androgen receptor (AR) exonic tandem CAG repeat-based standard HUMARA 
      assay in discriminating active (Xa) from inactive (Xi) X-chromosomes. The RP2 
      onshore tandem GAAA repeat contains neutral features that are lacking in the AR 
      disease-linked tandem CAG repeat, is highly polymorphic (heterozygosity rates 
      approximately 0.8) and shows minimal variation in the Xa/Xi ratio. The combined 
      informativeness of RP2/AR is approximately 0.97, and this assay excels at 
      determining the 5meCpG status of alleles at the Xp (RP2) and Xq (AR) chromosome 
      arms in a single reaction. These findings are relevant and directly translatable 
      to nonhuman primate models of XCI in which the AR CAG-repeat is monomorphic. We 
      conducted the RP2 onshore tandem GAAA repeat assay in the naturally occurring 
      chimeric New World monkey marmoset (Callitrichidae) and found it to be 
      informative. The RP2 onshore tandem GAAA repeat will facilitate studies on the 
      variable phenotypic expression of dominant and recessive X-linked diseases, 
      epigenetic changes in twins, the physiology of aging hematopoiesis, the 
      pathogenesis of age-related hematopoietic malignancies and the clonality of 
      cancers in human and nonhuman primates.

AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an X-linked neuromuscular disease 
      caused by a trinucleotide (CAG) repeat expansion in the androgen receptor gene. 
      Patients with SBMA have weakness, atrophy, and fasciculations in the bulbar and 
      extremity muscles. Individuals with CAG repeat lengths greater than 62 have not 
      previously been reported. We evaluated a 29year old SBMA patient with 68 CAGs who 
      had unusually early onset and findings not seen in others with the disease. 
      Analysis of the androgen receptor gene confirmed the repeat length of 68 CAGs in 
      both peripheral blood and fibroblasts. Evaluation of muscle and sensory function 
      showed deficits typical of SBMA, and in addition the patient had manifestations 
      of autonomic dysfunction and abnormal sexual development. These findings extend 
      the known phenotype associated with SBMA and shed new insight into the effects of 
      the mutated androgen receptor.

AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA, Kennedy's disease) is a motor neuron 
      disease caused by polyglutamine repeat expansion in the androgen receptor. 
      Although degeneration occurs in the spinal cord and muscle, the exact mechanism 
      is not clear. Induced pluripotent stem cells from spinal and bulbar muscular 
      atrophy patients provide a useful model for understanding the disease mechanism 
      and designing effective therapy. Stem cells were generated from six patients and 
      compared to control lines from three healthy individuals. Motor neurons from four 
      patients were differentiated from stem cells and characterized to understand 
      disease-relevant phenotypes. Stem cells created from patient fibroblasts express 
      less androgen receptor than control cells, but show androgen-dependent 
      stabilization and nuclear translocation. The expanded repeat in several stem cell 
      clones was unstable, with either expansion or contraction. Patient stem cell 
      clones produced a similar number of motor neurons compared to controls, with or 
      without androgen treatment. The stem cell-derived motor neurons had 
      immunoreactivity for HB9, Isl1, ChAT, and SMI-32, and those with the largest 
      repeat expansions were found to have increased acetylated alpha-tubulin and reduced 
      HDAC6. Reduced HDAC6 was also found in motor neuron cultures from two other 
      patients with shorter repeats. Evaluation of stably transfected mouse cells and 
      SBMA spinal cord showed similar changes in acetylated alpha-tubulin and HDAC6. 
      Perinuclear lysosomal enrichment, an HDAC6 dependent process, was disrupted in 
      motor neurons from two patients with the longest repeats. SBMA stem cells present 
      new insights into the disease, and the observations of reduced androgen receptor 
      levels, repeat instability, and reduced HDAC6 provide avenues for further 
      investigation of the disease mechanism and development of effective therapy.

      adverse reactions.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is a multisystemic disorder caused by a (CCTG)n 
      repeat expansion in intron 1 of CNBP. Transcription of the repeats causes a toxic 
      RNA gain of function involving their accumulation in ribonuclear foci. This leads 
      to sequestration of splicing factors and alters pre-mRNA splicing in a range of 
      downstream effector genes, which is thought to contribute to the diverse DM2 
      clinical features. Hyperlipidemia is frequent in DM2 patients, but the treatment 
      is problematic because of an increased risk of statin-induced adverse reactions. 
      Hypothesizing that shared pathways lead to the increased risk, we compared the 
      skeletal muscle expression profiles of DM2 patients and controls with patients 
      with hyperlipidemia on statin therapy. Neural precursor cell expressed, 
      developmentally downregulated-4 (NEDD4), an ubiquitin ligase, was one of the 
      dysregulated genes identified in DM2 patients and patients with statin-treated 
      hyperlipidemia. In DM2 muscle, NEDD4 mRNA was abnormally spliced, leading to 
      aberrant NEDD4 proteins. NEDD4 was down-regulated in persons taking statins, and 
      simvastatin treatment of C2C12 cells suppressed NEDD4 transcription. Phosphatase 
      and tensin homologue (PTEN), an established NEDD4 target, was increased and 
      accumulated in highly atrophic DM2 muscle fibers. PTEN ubiquitination was reduced 
      in DM2 myofibers, suggesting that the NEDD4-PTEN pathway is dysregulated in DM2 
      skeletal muscle. Thus, this pathway may contribute to the increased risk of 
      statin-adverse reactions in patients with DM2.

AB  - We report a case of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), also known as 
      Kennedy disease, with a 38 CAG-repeat expansion in exon-1 of the androgen 
      receptor gene, presenting with a 2-year history of mild speech difficulty, 
      dysphonia, and occasional choking. Initial clinical features and complementary 
      studies were consistent with SBMA. The disease progression, as assessed by the 
      Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised, remained stable 
      over the first 5 years from the onset but showed a rapid decline (from 42 to 24 
      points) over the next 18 months before his death. In the later stages of the 
      disease, deep tendon reflexes were preserved in limbs and a brisk jaw-jerk reflex 
      and bilateral Hoffmann sign were evident. Survival from disease onset was 78 
      months. The final cause of death was aspiration pneumonia. The atypical clinical 
      features, evolution, and accelerated disease course are not concordant with the 
      relatively short 38 CAG-repeat expansion in the androgen receptor gene. This may 
      represent either a variant SBMA phenotype, which has not been recorded to date, 
      or the development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in a known case of SBMA.

AB  - Decay accelerating factor (DAF), a complement-regulatory protein, protects cells 
      from bystander complement-mediated lysis and negatively regulates T cells. 
      Reduced expression of DAF occurs in several systemic autoimmune diseases 
      including systemic lupus erythematosus, and DAF deficiency exacerbates disease in 
      several autoimmune models, including murine mercury-induced autoimmunity (mHgIA). 
      Daf1, located within Hmr1, a chromosome 1 locus associated in DBA/2 mice with 
      resistance to mHgIA, could be a candidate. Here we show that reduced Daf1 
      transcription in lupus-prone mice was not associated with a reduction in the Daf1 
      transcription factor SP1. Studies of NZB mice congenic for the mHgIA-resistant 
      DBA/2 Hmr1 locus suggested that Daf1 expression was controlled by the host genome 
      and not the Hmr1 locus. A unique pentanucleotide repeat variant in the second 
      intron of Daf1 in DBA/2 mice was identified and shown in F2 intercrosses to be 
      associated with less severe disease; however, analysis of Hmr1 congenics 
      indicated that this most likely reflected the presence of 
      autoimmunity-predisposing genetic variants within the Hmr1 locus or that Daf1 
      expression is mediated by the tandem repeat in epistasis with other genetic 
      variants present in autoimmune-prone mice. These studies argue that the effect of 
      DAF on autoimmunity is complex and may require multiple genetic elements.

TI  - Demonstration of the cell clonality in canine hematopoietic tumors by 
      X-chromosome inactivation pattern analysis.
PG  - 61-9
LID - 10.1177/0300985814528217 [doi]
AB  - X-chromosome inactivation pattern (XCIP) analysis has been widely used to assess 
      cell clonality in various types of human neoplasms. In this study, a polymerase 
      chain reaction-based canine XCIP analysis of the androgen receptor (AR) gene was 
      applied for the assessment of cell clonality in canine hematopoietic tumors. This 
      XCIP analysis is based on the polymorphic CAG repeats in the AR gene and the 
      difference of methylation status between active and inactive X chromosomes. We 
      first examined the polymorphisms of 2 CAG tandem repeats in the AR gene in 52 
      male and 150 female dogs of various breeds. The 2 polymorphic CAG repeats 
      contained 9 to 12 and 10 to 14 CAGs in the first and second CAG repeats, 
      respectively. Of the 150 female dogs, 74 (49.3%) were heterozygous for the first 
      and/or second polymorphic CAG tandem repeats, indicating the utility of XCIP 
      analysis in these dogs. Canine XCIP analysis was then applied to clinical samples 
      from female dogs with canine high-grade lymphoma, chronic myelogenous leukemia, 
      acute myelogenous leukemia, and benign lymph node hyperplasia. Of 10 lymphoma 
      cell samples, 9 (90%) showed skewed XCIPs, indicating their clonal origins, 
      whereas all the nonneoplastic lymph node samples showed balanced XCIPs. Moreover, 
      bone marrow specimen from a dog with acute myelogenous leukemia and peripheral 
      leukocyte specimens from 2 dogs with chronic myelogenous leukemia showed skewed 
      XCIPs. XCIP analysis was successfully employed to demonstrate the cell clonality 
      of canine hematopoietic tumors in this study and will be applicable to evaluate 
      the clonality in various proliferative disorders in dogs.

AB  - Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) microscopy is a powerful tool used to 
      identify molecular interactions in live or fixed cells using a non-radiative 
      transfer of energy from a donor fluorophore in the excited state to an acceptor 
      fluorophore in close proximity. FRET can be a very sensitive tool to study 
      protein-protein and/or protein-nucleic acids interactions. RNA toxicity is 
      implicated in a number of disorders; especially those associated with expanded 
      repeat sequences, such as myotonic dystrophy. Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is caused 
      by a (CTG)n repeat expansion in the 3' UTR of the DMPK gene which results in 
      nuclear retention of mutant DMPK transcripts in RNA foci. This results in toxic 
      gain-of-function effects mediated through altered functions of RNA-binding 
      proteins (e.g. MBNL1, hnRNPH, CUGBP1). In this study we demonstrate the potential 
      of a new acceptor photobleaching assay to measure FRET (AP-FRET) between RNA and 
      protein. We chose to focus on the interaction between MBNL1 and mutant DMPK mRNA 
      in cells from DM1 patients due to the strong microscopic evidence of their 
      co-localization. Using this technique we have direct evidence of intracellular 
      interaction between MBNL1 and the DMPK RNA. Furthermore using the AP-FRET assay 
      and MBNL1 mutants, we show that all four zinc-finger motifs in MBNL1 are crucial 
      for MBNL1-RNA foci interactions. The data derived using this new assay provides 
      compelling evidence for the interaction between RNA binding proteins and RNA 
      foci, and mechanistic insights into MBNL1-RNA foci interaction demonstrating the 
      power of AP-FRET in examining RNA-Protein interactions in DM1.

AB  - X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is characterized by 
      adult-onset muscle weakness and lower motor neuron degeneration. SBMA is caused 
      by CAG-polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansions in the androgen receptor (AR) 
      gene. Pathological findings include motor neuron loss, with polyQ-AR accumulation 
      in intranuclear inclusions. SBMA patients exhibit myopathic features, suggesting 
      a role for muscle in disease pathogenesis. To determine the contribution of 
      muscle, we developed a BAC mouse model featuring a floxed first exon to permit 
      cell-type-specific excision of human AR121Q. BAC fxAR121 mice develop systemic 
      and neuromuscular phenotypes, including shortened survival. After validating 
      termination of AR121 expression and full rescue with ubiquitous Cre, we crossed 
      BAC fxAR121 mice with Human Skeletal Actin-Cre mice. Muscle-specific excision 
      prevented weight loss, motor phenotypes, muscle pathology, and motor neuronopathy 
      and dramatically extended survival. Our results reveal a crucial role for muscle 
      expression of polyQ-AR in SBMA and suggest muscle-directed therapies as effective 
      treatments.

AB  - Multiple locus variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) analysis (MLVA) has become 
      a reliable tool, able to establish genetic relationships for epidemiological 
      surveillance and molecular subtyping of pathogens such as verotoxigenic 
      Escherichia coli (VTEC). This emerging pathogen whose primary reservoir is the 
      cattle causes severe disease in humans, such as hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic 
      uremic syndrome. With the aim of comparing a recently proposed MLVA assay with 
      that used routinely in our laboratory, we analyzed a set of VTEC isolates (n = 
      72) obtained from meat using both assays. All samples could be typed by the new 
      MLVA assay, and an increase in the number of distinct profiles (31-43) was 
      observed. However, intraserotype resolution was not significantly enhanced; thus, 
      the incorporation of more VNTR loci is still needed to achieve a greater 
      discrimination among non-O157:H7 serotypes.

AB  - PURPOSE: To study cerebral adenosine receptors (AR) in premanifest and manifest 
      stages of Huntington's disease (HD). METHODS: We quantified the cerebral binding 
      potential (BP ND) of the A(1)AR in carriers of the HD CAG trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion using the radioligand [(18) F]CPFPX and PET. Four groups were 
      investigated: (i) premanifest individuals far (preHD-A; n = 7) or (ii) near 
      (preHD-B; n = 6) to the predicted symptom onset, (iii) manifest HD patients 
      (n = 8), and (iv) controls (n = 36). RESULTS: Cerebral A(1)AR values of preHD-A 
      subjects were generally higher than those of controls (by up to 31%, p < .01, in 
      the thalamus on average). Across stages a successive reduction of A(1)AR BPND was 
      observed to the levels of controls in preHD-B and undercutting controls in 
      manifest HD by down to 25%, p < .01, in the caudatus and amygdala. There was a 
      strong correlation between A(1)AR BP ND and years to onset. Before onset of HD, the 
      assumed annual rates of change of A(1)AR density were -1.2% in the caudatus, -1.7% 
      in the thalamus and -3.4% in the amygdala, while the corresponding volume losses 
      amounted to 0.6%, 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Adenosine receptors 
      switch from supra to subnormal levels during phenoconversion of HD. This 
      differential regulation may play a role in the pathophysiology of altered energy 
      metabolism.

AB  - Phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate [PI(3,5)P2] is a low-abundance 
      phosphoinositide presumed to be localized to endosomes and lysosomes, where it 
      recruits cytoplasmic peripheral proteins and regulates endolysosome-localized 
      membrane channel activity. Cells lacking PI(3,5)P2 exhibit lysosomal trafficking 
      defects, and human mutations in the PI(3,5)P2-metabolizing enzymes cause 
      lysosome-related diseases. The spatial and temporal dynamics of PI(3,5)P2, 
      however, remain unclear due to the lack of a reliable detection method. Of the 
      seven known phosphoinositides, only PI(3,5)P2 binds, in the low nanomolar range, 
      to a cytoplasmic phosphoinositide-interacting domain (ML1N) to activate late 
      endosome and lysosome (LEL)-localized transient receptor potential Mucolipin 1 
      (TRPML1) channels. Here, we report the generation and characterization of a 
      PI(3,5)P2-specific probe, generated by the fusion of fluorescence tags to the 
      tandem repeats of ML1N. The probe was mainly localized to the membranes of 
      Lamp1-positive compartments, and the localization pattern was dynamically altered 
      by either mutations in the probe, or by genetically or pharmacologically 
      manipulating the cellular levels of PI(3,5)P2. Through the use of time-lapse 
      live-cell imaging, we found that the localization of the PI(3,5)P2 probe was 
      regulated by serum withdrawal/addition, undergoing rapid changes immediately 
      before membrane fusion of two LELs. Our development of a PI(3,5)P2-specific probe 
      may facilitate studies of both intracellular signal transduction and membrane 
      trafficking in the endosomes and lysosomes.

AB  - X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an adult-onset 
      neuromuscular disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the androgen receptor 
      gene. Postural hand tremor is well known as a non-motor neuron sign, but to our 
      knowledge postural leg tremor has not been reported. We studied the occurrence 
      and physiological features of postural leg tremor in 12 male patients (38-64 
      years old) with genetically proven SBMA. Three patients had postural leg tremor 
      with a frequency of 4-7Hz. In these patients, sensory nerve action potential 
      (SNAP) was not detected in the lower limbs. There were significant differences 
      between the patients with postural leg tremor and those without postural leg 
      tremor in both the SNAP of the sural nerve and the length of the CAG repeat. 
      Phenotypical differences between shorter CAG repeats, which indicate a 
      sensory-dominant phenotype, and longer CAG repeats, which indicate a 
      motor-dominant phenotype, have been previously reported. In the present study, 
      60% of patients with shorter CAG repeats (<47) showed leg tremor and none of the 
      patients with longer CAG repeats (>/=47) did. Postural leg tremor could be a 
      clinical feature that predicts shorter CAG repeats of the androgen receptor gene.

TI  - Targeting RNA foci in iPSC-derived motor neurons from ALS patients with a C9ORF72 
      repeat expansion.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe neurodegenerative condition 
      characterized by loss of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. Expansions 
      of a hexanucleotide repeat (GGGGCC) in the noncoding region of the C9ORF72 gene 
      are the most common cause of the familial form of ALS (C9-ALS), as well as 
      frontotemporal lobar degeneration and other neurological diseases. How the repeat 
      expansion causes disease remains unclear, with both loss of function 
      (haploinsufficiency) and gain of function (either toxic RNA or protein products) 
      proposed. We report a cellular model of C9-ALS with motor neurons differentiated 
      from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from ALS patients carrying 
      the C9ORF72 repeat expansion. No significant loss of C9ORF72 expression was 
      observed, and knockdown of the transcript was not toxic to cultured human motor 
      neurons. Transcription of the repeat was increased, leading to accumulation of 
      GGGGCC repeat-containing RNA foci selectively in C9-ALS iPSC-derived motor 
      neurons. Repeat-containing RNA foci colocalized with hnRNPA1 and Pur-alpha, 
      suggesting that they may be able to alter RNA metabolism. C9-ALS motor neurons 
      showed altered expression of genes involved in membrane excitability including 
      DPP6, and demonstrated a diminished capacity to fire continuous spikes upon 
      depolarization compared to control motor neurons. Antisense oligonucleotides 
      targeting the C9ORF72 transcript suppressed RNA foci formation and reversed gene 
      expression alterations in C9-ALS motor neurons. These data show that 
      patient-derived motor neurons can be used to delineate pathogenic events in ALS.

TI  - Is the Expression of Androgen Receptor Protein Associated With the Length of AC 
      Repeats in the Type III 5-alpha Reductase Gene in Prostate Cancer Patients?
PG  - 404-8
LID - 10.4111/kju.2013.54.6.404 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Type III 5-alpha reductase (SRD5A3; steroid 5-alpha reductase 3) may be 
      associated with the progression of prostate cancer (PCa). The aim of our study 
      was to determine whether the length of AC repeats in the SRD5A3 gene is 
      associated with the risk of PCa and the expression of androgen receptor (AR) 
      protein in Korean men. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared the length of AC 
      repeats in the short tandem repeat (STR) region of the SRD5A3 gene in 68 PCa 
      patients and 81 control subjects by genotyping. A total of 55 patients in the PCa 
      group underwent radical prostatectomy. We evaluated the expression of AR protein 
      by using Western blotting and tested the association between the type of AC 
      repeats in the SRD5A3 gene and AR protein expression and clinical and pathologic 
      parameters. RESULTS: The short type of STR had less than 21 copies of AC repeats 
      in the SRD5A3 gene. The SS type (short and short type) of STR of the SRD5A3 gene 
      was 2.2 times as likely to occur in PCa patients as in controls (odds ratio, 
      2.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.14 to 4.31; p=0.019). However, AC repeats of the 
      SRD5A3 gene were not associated with AR protein expression or clinical or 
      pathologic parameters in PCa samples. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the 
      short AC repeats of SRD5A3 polymorphism are associated with an increased risk of 
      PCa. SRD5A3 polymorphism may contribute to a genetic predisposition for PCa.

PG  - e30-2
LID - 10.1111/ane.12140 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a lower motor neuron 
      disease caused by a CAG repeat expansion within the androgen receptor (AR) gene. 
      Toxic nuclear accumulation of mutant AR has been observed in tissues other than 
      nervous system including cardiac muscle. Moreover, CAG polymorphism length within 
      AR has been associated with an increased risk of heart disease. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: To test the hypothesis of the presence of cardiomyopathy in SBMA, a full 
      cardiac protocol was applied to 25 SBMA patients. RESULTS: Patients' age ranged 
      between 32 and 75 years. Cardiologic examination, 12-lead ECG, and 
      echocardiography showed no abnormalities other than those consistent with 
      hypertensive heart disease. One patient showed frequent supraventricular 
      premature beats in absence of other significant arrhythmias at the 24-h ECG 
      Holter. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not support the hypothesis of a primary 
      cardiomyopathy in SBMA.

TI  - Androgen receptor polyglutamine repeat number: models of selection and disease 
      susceptibility.
PG  - 180-96
LID - 10.1111/j.1752-4571.2012.00275.x [doi]
AB  - Variation in polyglutamine repeat number in the androgen receptor (AR CAGn) is 
      negatively correlated with the transcription of androgen-responsive genes and is 
      associated with susceptibility to an extensive list of human disease. Only a 
      small portion of the heritability for many of these diseases is explained by 
      conventional SNP-based genome-wide association studies, and the forces shaping AR 
      CAGn among humans remains largely unexplored. Here, we propose evolutionary 
      models for understanding selection at the AR CAG locus, namely balancing 
      selection, sexual conflict, accumulation-selection, and antagonistic pleiotropy. 
      We evaluate these models by examining AR CAGn-linked susceptibility to eight 
      extensively studied diseases representing the diverse physiological roles of 
      androgens, and consider the costs of these diseases by their frequency and 
      fitness effects. Five diseases could contribute to the distribution of AR CAGn 
      observed among contemporary human populations. With support for disease 
      susceptibilities associated with long and short AR CAGn, balancing selection 
      provides a useful model for studying selection at this locus. Gender-specific 
      differences AR CAGn health effects also support this locus as a candidate for 
      sexual conflict over repeat number. Accompanied by the accumulation of AR CAGn in 
      humans, these models help explain the distribution of repeat number in 
      contemporary human populations.

AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an X-linked motor neuron disease 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the androgen receptor (AR) gene. 
      Ligand-dependent nuclear accumulation of mutant AR protein is a critical 
      characteristic of the pathogenesis of SBMA. SBMA has been modeled in 
      AR-overexpressing animals, but precisely how the polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion 
      leads to neurodegeneration is unclear. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are 
      a new technology that can be used to model human diseases, study pathogenic 
      mechanisms, and develop novel drugs. We established SBMA patient-derived iPSCs, 
      investigated their cellular biochemical characteristics, and found that 
      SBMA-iPSCs can differentiate into motor neurons. The CAG repeat numbers in the AR 
      gene of SBMA-iPSCs and also in the atrophin-1 gene of iPSCs derived from another 
      polyQ disease, dentato-rubro-pallido-luysian atrophy (DRPLA), remain unchanged 
      during reprogramming, long term passage, and differentiation, indicating that 
      polyQ disease-associated CAG repeats are stable during maintenance of iPSCs. The 
      level of AR expression is up-regulated by neuronal differentiation and treatment 
      with the AR ligand dihydrotestosterone. Filter retardation assays indicated that 
      aggregation of ARs following dihydrotestosterone treatment in neurons derived 
      from SBMA-iPSCs increases significantly compared with neurological control iPSCs, 
      easily recapitulating the pathological feature of mutant ARs in SBMA-iPSCs. This 
      phenomenon was not observed in iPSCs and fibroblasts, thereby showing the 
      neuron-dominant phenotype of this disease. Furthermore, the HSP90 inhibitor 
      17-allylaminogeldanamycin sharply decreased the level of aggregated AR in neurons 
      derived from SBMA-iPSCs, indicating a potential for discovery and validation of 
      candidate drugs. We found that SBMA-iPSCs possess disease-specific biochemical 
      features and could thus open new avenues of research into not only SBMA, but also 
      other polyglutamine diseases.

      loss of lower motor neurons and by a similar protective response to growth 
      factors in animal models, therefore raising the possibility of an overlap in the 
      final pathogenic cascade. Mutations in the FUS gene and fused in sarcoma (FUS) 
      protein pathology have now been identified in some amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
      cases, while a CAG expansion in the androgen receptor gene is known to cause 
      SBMA. Recently, multiple lines of evidence have identified FUS as a major target 
      of the androgen receptor, suggesting that FUS could be dysregulated in SBMA motor 
      neurons. We have investigated this possibility by using a well-established mouse 
      model of SBMA and our analysis of primary motor neuron cultures, spinal cords, 
      and microdissected motor neurons show no evidence for FUS dysregulation.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an adult-onset motor 
      neuron disease caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the androgen receptor gene. 
      The aim of this study was to verify whether urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine 
      (8-OHdG), an oxidative stress marker, is a biomarker for SBMA. METHODS: We 
      measured the levels of urinary 8-OHdG in 33 genetically confirmed SBMA patients 
      and 32 age-matched controls over a 24-month period at 6-month intervals. RESULTS: 
      Urinary 8-OHdG levels in SBMA patients were significantly elevated compared with 
      those of controls and correlated well with motor function scores. During the 
      follow-up period, urinary 8-OHdG levels increased and correlated with motor 
      function at each time-point. In addition, urinary 8-OHdG levels at baseline were 
      correlated with changes in the 6-minute walk test during 24 months. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Urinary 8-OHdG is a biomarker for SBMA, reflecting the severity and possibly 
      predicting the deterioration of motor function.

TI  - The androgen receptor facilitates inhibition of human dopamine transporter (DAT1) 
      reporter gene expression by HESR1 and HESR2 via the variable number of tandem 
      repeats.
PG  - 54-9
LID - 10.1016/j.neulet.2012.07.021 [doi]
AB  - A functional genetic polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) within exon 
      15 of the human DAT gene (DAT1) has been described. This 3'-UTR contains a 
      variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) 40 bp in length; many association 
      studies of psychiatric or developmental disorders with this VNTR have been 
      conducted. We previously demonstrated that HESR1 (the Hairy/enhancer of split 
      related transcriptional factor 1 with YRPW motif) and HESR2 reduced DAT reporter 
      gene expression via this 3'-UTR. VNTR allele-dependent altered reporter gene 
      expression was also observed. In the present study, we wanted to clarify the 
      molecular characterization of HESR1 and HESR2, focusing on its cis-element and 
      co-factor. Deletion of the VNTR domain increased reporter gene expression both 
      with and without transfection of HESRs, suggesting that the VNTR inhibits DAT 
      expression, and is responsive to HESRs. In the presence of transfected androgen 
      receptor (AR), activity of the luciferase reporter with the nine-repeat allele 
      (9r) decreased, while that with the ten-repeat allele (10r), the most frequent in 
      the population, increased significantly. Furthermore, co-expression of HESR1 or 
      HESR2 with AR increased the inhibitory effect of the HESRs. Our data indicate 
      that a functional modification occurs when the HESRs are coupled with AR. This 
      HESR-AR interaction could be the molecular basis of sexual dimorphisms in DAT 
      expression, or other dopamine-related behavioral traits.

TI  - Altered expression and splicing of Ca(2+) metabolism genes in myotonic 
      dystrophies DM1 and DM2.
PG  - 390-405

AB  - AIMS: Myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2 (DM1 and DM2) are multisystem disorders 
      caused by similar repeat expansion mutations, with similar yet distinct clinical 
      features. Aberrant splicing of multiple effector genes, as well as dysregulation 
      of transcription and translation, has been suggested to underlie different 
      aspects of the complex phenotypes in DM1 and DM2. Ca(2+) plays a central role in 
      both muscle contraction and control of gene expression, and recent expression 
      profiling studies have indicated major perturbations of the Ca(2+) signalling 
      pathways in DM. Here we have further investigated the expression of genes and 
      proteins involved in Ca(2+) metabolism in DM patients, including Ca(2+) channels 
      and Ca(2+) binding proteins. METHODS: We used patient muscle biopsies to analyse 
      mRNA expression and splicing of genes by microarray expression profiling and 
      RT-PCR. We studied protein expression by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. 
      RESULTS: Most of the genes studied showed mRNA up-regulation in expression 
      profiling. When analysed by immunohistochemistry the Ca(2+) release channel 
      ryanodine receptor was reduced in DM1 and DM2, as was calsequestrin 2, a 
      sarcoplasmic reticulum lumen Ca(2+) storage protein. Abnormal splicing of ATP2A1 
      was more pronounced in DM2 than DM1. CONCLUSIONS: We observed abnormal mRNA and 
      protein expression in DM affecting several proteins involved in Ca(2+) 
      metabolism, with some differences between DM1 and DM2. Our protein expression 
      studies are suggestive of a post-transcriptional defect(s) in the myotonic 
      dystrophies.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a multi-systemic disorder caused by a CTG 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion (CTG(exp)) in the DMPK gene. In skeletal muscle, 
      nuclear sequestration of the alternative splicing factor muscleblind-like 1 
      (MBNL1) explains the majority of the alternative splicing defects observed in the 
      HSA(LR) transgenic mouse model which expresses a pathogenic range CTG(exp). In 
      the present study, we addressed the possibility that MBNL1 sequestration by 
      CUG(exp) RNA also contributes to splicing defects in the mammalian brain. We 
      examined RNA from the brains of homozygous Mbnl1(DeltaE3/DeltaE3) knockout mice using 
      splicing-sensitive microarrays. We used RT-PCR to validate a subset of 
      alternative cassette exons identified by microarray analysis with brain tissues 
      from Mbnl1(DeltaE3/DeltaE3) knockout mice and post-mortem DM1 patients. Surprisingly, 
      splicing-sensitive microarray analysis of Mbnl1(DeltaE3/DeltaE3) brains yielded only 14 
      candidates for mis-spliced exons. While we confirmed that several of these 
      splicing events are perturbed in both Mbnl1 knockout and DM1 brains, the extent 
      of splicing mis-regulation in the mouse model was significantly less than 
      observed in DM1. Additionally, several alternative exons, including Grin1 exon 4, 
      App exon 7 and Mapt exons 3 and 9, which have previously been reported to be 
      aberrantly spliced in human DM1 brain, were spliced normally in the Mbnl1 
      knockout brain. The sequestration of MBNL1 by CUG(exp) RNA results in some of the 
      aberrant splicing events in the DM1 brain. However, we conclude that other 
      factors, possibly other MBNL proteins, likely contribute to splicing 
      mis-regulation in the DM1 brain.

LID - 10.1016/j.meegid.2012.01.026 [doi]
AB  - In the present study, new variable number tandem repeats (VNTR) loci in the 
      Neisseria gonorrhoeae genome were identified in silico. VNTR analysis scheme 
      using PCR and agarose or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was developed based 
      on nine VNTR loci with various degrees of polymorphism. The method was used to 
      genotype a collection of 48 isolates, obtained from patients with gonorrhea in 
      Almaty, Kazakhstan during the period from December 2008 to November 2009. This 
      collection of isolates was also characterized by the opa-typing and multiantigen 
      sequence typing (NG-MAST). The discriminatory power of the VNTR analysis 
      translated by Hunter-Gaston Discrimination Index (HGDI) was similar to that of 
      opa typing (HGDI=0.98 versus 0.97) and slightly higher than that of NG-MAST 
      (HDGI=0.95). The adjusted Rand (AR) coefficients and Wallace coefficients showed 
      that the overall concordance between the typing methods was not high. VNTR 
      analysis described here is simple, inexpensive, easy to interpret, and it would 
      be reliable for the comparison of data obtained in different laboratories. The 
      proposed VNTR loci might be used for epidemiological studies of gonococcal 
      infections.

TI  - Cancer risk among patients with myotonic muscular dystrophy.
PG  - 2480-6
LID - 10.1001/jama.2011.1796 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Myotonic muscular dystrophy (MMD) is an autosomal-dominant multisystem 
      neuromuscular disorder characterized by unstable nucleotide repeat expansions. 
      Case reports have suggested that MMD patients may be at increased risk of 
      malignancy, putative risks that have never been quantified. OBJECTIVE: To 
      quantitatively evaluate cancer risk in patients with MMD, overall and by sex and 
      age. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We identified 1658 patients with an MMD 
      discharge diagnosis in the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register or Danish National 
      Patient Registry between 1977 and 2008. We linked these patients to their 
      corresponding cancer registry. Patients were followed up from date of first 
      MMD-related inpatient or outpatient contact to first cancer diagnosis, death, 
      emigration, or completion of cancer registration. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risks of 
      all cancers combined and by anatomic site, stratified by sex and age. RESULTS: 
      One hundred four patients with an inpatient or outpatient discharge diagnosis of 
      MMD developed cancer during postdischarge follow-up. This corresponds to an 
      observed cancer rate of 73.4 per 10,000 person-years in MMD vs an expected rate 
      of 36.9 per 10,000 person-years in the general Swedish and Danish populations 
      combined (standardized incidence ratio [SIR], 2.0; 95% CI, 1.6-2.4). 
      Specifically, we observed significant excess risks of cancers of the endometrium 
      (n = 11; observed rate, 16.1/10,000 person-years; SIR, 7.6; 95% CI, 4.0-13.2), 
      brain (n = 7; observed rate, 4.9/10,000 person-years; SIR, 5.3; 95% CI, 
      2.3-10.4), ovary (n = 7; observed rate, 10.3/10,000 person-years; SIR, 5.2; 95% 
      CI, 2.3-10.2), and colon (n = 10; observed rate, 7.1/10,000 person-years; SIR, 
      2.9; 95% CI, 1.5-5.1). Cancer risks were similar in women and men after excluding 
      genital organ tumors (SIR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4-2.5, vs SIR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3-2.5, 
      respectively; P = .81 for heterogeneity; observed rates, 64.5 and 47.7 per 10,000 
      person-years in women and men, respectively). The same pattern of cancer excess 
      was observed first in the Swedish and then in the Danish cohorts, which were 
      studied sequentially and initially analyzed independently. CONCLUSION: Patients 
      with MMD identified from the Swedish and Danish patient registries were at 
      increased risk of cancer both overall and for selected anatomic sites.

TI  - Runx2 contributes to murine Col10a1 gene regulation through direct interaction 
      with its cis-enhancer.
PG  - 2899-910
LID - 10.1002/jbmr.504 [doi]
AB  - We have recently shown that a 150-bp Col10a1 distal promoter (-4296 to -4147 bp) 
      is sufficient to direct hypertrophic chondrocyte-specific reporter (LacZ) 
      expression in vivo. More recently, through detailed sequence analysis we 
      identified two putative tandem-repeat Runx2 binding sites within the 3'-end of 
      this 150-bp region (TGTGGG-TGTGGC, -4187 to -4176 bp). Candidate electrophoretic 
      mobility shift assay (EMSA), chromatin immunoprecipitation, and transfection 
      studies demonstrate that these putative Runx2 sites bind Runx2 and mediate 
      upregulated Col10a1/reporter activity in vitro. Transgenic studies using the 
      5'-sequence without Runx2 sites were not able to drive the cell-specific LacZ 
      reporter activity, suggesting the in vivo requirement of the Runx2 sites located 
      in the 3'-end in mediating Col10a1/reporter expression. Indeed, mutating the 
      Runx2 sites in the context of the 150-bp promoter abolishes its capacity to drive 
      hypertrophic chondrocyte-specific reporter expression in transgenic mice. We have 
      also generated multiple transgenic mouse lines using only the 3'-sequence 
      containing the Runx2 sites to drive the LacZ gene. Interestingly, no hypertrophic 
      chondrocyte-specific blue staining was observed in these transgenic mice. 
      Together, our data support that Runx2 directly interacts with murine Col10a1 
      cis-enhancer. This interaction is required but not sufficient for cell-specific 
      Col10a1 promoter activity in vivo. Additional cooperative/repressive elements 
      within the 5'- or 3'-sequences of this 150-bp promoter are needed to work with 
      Runx2 together to mediate cell-specific Col10a1 expression. Further delineation 
      of these elements/factors has the potential to identify novel therapeutic targets 
      for multiple skeletal disorders, including osteoarthritis, that show abnormal 
      Col10a1 expression and altered chondrocyte maturation.

TI  - CAG repeat length in androgen receptor gene and male infertility in Egyptian 
      patients.
PG  - 26-33

AB  - The CAG repeat and its association with infertility has been debatable. 
      Therefore, this study was planned to assess the distribution of CAG repeat 
      expansion in Egyptian patients and to investigate its association with male 
      infertility. Forty-five infertile men were eligible for the study in addition to 
      20 aged-matched fertile males as control. Semen analysis, scrotal sonography, 
      assay of serum testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising 
      hormone (LH), and determination of the CAG repeat number within exon 1 of the 
      androgen receptor (AR) gene were carried out. Statistically significant 
      difference was found between infertile and control groups regarding sperm count, 
      sperm motility, serum FSH level and CAG repeats (P < 0.05); statistically 
      insignificant difference for the CAG repeats (P = 1.0) was found between 
      oligozoospermic and asthenospermic groups; negative correlation was found between 
      CAG repeat length and sperm count, and a positive correlation was found between 
      CAG repeat length and serum FSH (P < 0.05). Our results validate the concept that 
      long stretches of CAG repeat may be associated with lower AR function with 
      derangement of sperm production, and this may contribute to male infertility in 
      Egyptian men.

TI  - Common variants in PARK loci and related genes and Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 280-8
LID - 10.1002/mds.23376 [doi]
AB  - Rare mutations in PARK loci genes cause Parkinson's disease (PD) in some families 
      and isolated populations. We investigated the association of common variants in 
      PARK loci and related genes with PD susceptibility and age at onset in an outbred 
      population. A total of 1,103 PD cases from the upper Midwest, USA, were 
      individually matched to unaffected siblings (n = 654) or unrelated controls (n = 
      449) from the same region. Using a sequencing approach in 25 cases and 25 
      controls, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in species-conserved regions of 
      PARK loci and related genes were detected. We selected additional tag SNPs from 
      the HapMap. We genotyped a total of 235 SNPs and two variable number tandem 
      repeats in the ATP13A2, DJ1, LRRK1, LRRK2, MAPT, Omi/HtrA2, PARK2, PINK1, SNCA, 
      SNCB, SNCG, SPR, and UCHL1 genes in all 2,206 subjects. Case-control analyses 
      were performed to study association with PD susceptibility, while cases-only 
      analyses were used to study association with age at onset. Only MAPT SNP 
      rs2435200 was associated with PD susceptibility after correction for multiple 
      testing (OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.64-0.86, uncorrected P < 0.0001, log additive 
      model); however, 16 additional MAPT variants, seven SNCA variants, and one LRRK2, 
      PARK2, and UCHL1 variants each had significant uncorrected P-values. There were 
      no significant associations for age at onset after correction for multiple 
      testing. Our results confirm the association of MAPT and SNCA genes with PD 
      susceptibility but show limited association of other PARK loci and related genes 
      with PD.

TI  - Mutant CAG repeats of Huntingtin transcript fold into hairpins, form nuclear foci

AB  - The CAG repeat expansions that occur in translated regions of specific genes can 
      cause human genetic disorders known as polyglutamine (poly-Q)-triggered diseases. 
      Huntington's disease and spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) are examples of 
      these diseases in which underlying mutations are localized near other 
      trinucleotide repeats in the huntingtin (HTT) and androgen receptor (AR) genes, 
      respectively. Mutant proteins that contain expanded polyglutamine tracts are 
      well-known triggers of pathogenesis in poly-Q diseases, but a toxic role for 
      mutant transcripts has also been proposed. To gain insight into the structural 
      features of complex triplet repeats of HTT and AR transcripts, we determined 
      their structures in vitro and showed the contribution of neighboring repeats to 
      CAG repeat hairpin formation. We also demonstrated that the expanded transcript 
      is retained in the nucleus of human HD fibroblasts and is colocalized with the 
      MBNL1 protein. This suggests that the CAG repeats in the HTT mRNA adopt ds-like 
      RNA conformations in vivo. The intracellular structure of the CAG repeat region 
      of mutant HTT transcripts was not sufficiently stable to be protected from 
      cleavage by an siRNA targeting the repeats and the silencing efficiency was 
      higher for the mutant transcript than for its normal counterpart.

      (CTG)*(CAG) repeats.
PG  - 580-8
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddq501 [doi]
AB  - More than 12 neurogenetic disorders are caused by unstable expansions of 
      (CTG)*(CAG) repeats. The expanded repeats are unstable in germline and somatic 
      cells, with potential consequences for disease severity. Previous studies have 
      shown that contractions of (CAG)(95) are more frequent when the repeat tract is 
      transcribed. Here we determined whether transcription can promote repeat 
      expansion, using (CTG)*(CAG) repeat tracts in the size range that is typical for 
      myotonic dystrophy type 1. We derived normal human fibroblasts having single-copy 
      genomic integrations of 800 CTG repeats. The repeat tract showed modest 
      instability when it was not transcribed, yielding an estimated mutation rate of 
      0.28% per generation. Instability was enhanced several-fold by transcription in 
      the forward or reverse transcription, and 30-fold by bidirectional transcription, 
      yielding many expansions and contractions of more than 200 repeats. These results 
      suggest that convergent bidirectional transcription, which has been reported at 
      several disease loci, could contribute to somatic instability of highly expanded 
      (CTG)*(CAG) repeats.

TI  - Prenatal flutamide enhances survival in a myogenic mouse model of spinal bulbar 
      muscular atrophy.
PG  - 25-34
LID - 10.1159/000313682 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is caused by a CAG repeat 
      expansion mutation in the androgen receptor (AR) gene, and mutant AR is presumed 
      to act in motoneurons to cause SBMA. However, we found that mice overexpressing 
      wild-type (wt) AR solely in skeletal muscle fibers display the same 
      androgen-dependent disease phenotype as when mutant AR is broadly expressed, 
      challenging the assumptions that only an expanded AR can induce disease and that 
      SBMA is strictly neurogenic. We have previously reported that AR toxicity was 
      ligand dependent in our model, and that very few transgenic (tg) males survived 
      beyond birth. METHODS: We tested whether the AR antagonist flutamide could block 
      perinatal toxicity. tg males were treated prenatally with flutamide and assessed 
      for survival and motor behavior in adulthood. RESULTS: Prenatal treatment with 
      flutamide rescued tg male pups from perinatal death, and, as adults, such 
      perinatally rescued tg males showed an SBMA phenotype that was comparable to that 
      of previously described untreated tg males. Moreover, tg males carrying a mutant 
      endogenous allele for AR--the testicular feminization mutation (tfm)--and thus 
      having functional AR only in muscle fibers nevertheless displayed the same 
      androgen-dependent disease phenotype as adults. CONCLUSIONS: These mice represent 
      an excellent model to study the myogenic contribution to SBMA as they display 
      many of the core features of disease as other mouse models. These data 
      demonstrate that AR acting exclusively in muscle fibers is sufficient to induce 
      SBMA symptoms and that flutamide is protective perinatally.

TI  - CUGBP1 overexpression in mouse skeletal muscle reproduces features of myotonic 
      dystrophy type 1.
PG  - 3614-22
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddq277 [doi]
AB  - The neuromuscular disease myotonic dystrophy type I (DM1) affects multiple organ 
      systems with the major symptoms being severe muscle weakness, progressive muscle 
      wasting and myotonia. The causative mutation in DM1 is a CTG repeat expansion in 
      the 3'-untranslated region of the DM protein kinase (DMPK) gene. RNA transcribed 
      from the expanded allele contains the expanded CUG repeats and leads to the 
      nuclear depletion of Muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1) and to the increased steady-state 
      levels of CUG-binding protein 1 (CUGBP1). The pathogenic effects of MBNL1 
      depletion have previously been tested by the generation of MBNL1 knockout mice, 
      but the consequence of CUGBP1 overexpression in adult muscle is not known. In a 
      DM1 mouse model expressing RNA containing 960 CUG repeats in skeletal muscle, 
      CUGBP1 up-regulation is temporally correlated with severe muscle wasting. In this 
      study, we generated transgenic mice with doxycycline-inducible and skeletal 
      muscle-specific expression of CUGBP1. Adult mouse skeletal muscle overexpressing 
      CUGBP1 reproduces molecular and physiological defects of DM1 tissue. The results 
      from this study strongly suggest that CUGBP1 has a major role in DM1 skeletal 
      muscle pathogenesis.

TI  - Interaction between estrogens and androgen receptor genes microsatellites, 
      prostate-specific antigen and androgen receptor expressions in breast cancer.
PG  - 198-206
AB  - The role of estrogen and androgen receptors signaling in breast cancer is widely 
      accepted, but the interrelations between them are not well understood. It was 
      suggested that PSA could be a marker of endogenous balance between androgens and 
      estrogens. In this context, we intended to investigate the potential of 
      relationship between polymorphic tandem repeats (CAG, TA and CA) in AR (androgen 
      receptor), ERalpha (estrogen receptor alpha) and ERbeta (estrogen receptor beta) 
      genes and the immunoexpression of PSA and AR proteins. We assessed also the 
      possible influences of CAG, TA, and CA variables and other available prognostic 
      factors (ER, PR, AR, HER2/neu, PSA expression, and nodal status) on disease-free 
      survival. We assessed the polymorphic tandem repeats lengths by genotyping, 
      followed by high-resolution denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 163 
      breast cancers. Immunohistochemistry was performed to assess the expressions of 
      AR, PSA, ER, PR and HER2/neu proteins. Our results showed that PSA was correlated 
      with the length of CA repeats in the 3'-untranslated region of ERbeta, shorter CA 
      repeats being correlated with PSA expression (p=0.03). AR immunoexpression was 
      correlated with CAG repeats on AR gene, higher number of repeats being linked to 
      a higher AR immunoexpression (p=0.04). Performing logistic regression to 
      investigate relationships with prognosis, we observed that PSA immunoexpression 
      (p=0.004), the nodal status (p-<0.001) and marginally, longer TA repeats (p=0.05) 
      were correlated with increased disease-free survival. AR expression presented a 
      low statistical value (p=0.054) in predicting evolution and was not entered into 
      the multivariate regression analysis. Altogether, our findings supports the 
      hypothesis that estrogens, through both alpha and beta-receptors variants are 
      mediating the AR signaling pathway.

AB  - We report the clinical and electrophysiological features of a large Turkish 
      family with genetically confirmed X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy 
      (SBMA). Family members were identified by field work. A detailed history was 
      obtained from each subject, and each subject received a detailed neurological 
      examination. To confirm the CAG repeat expansion in the AR gene, genomic DNA was 
      extracted from the peripheral blood of patients. The family consisted of 128 
      individuals over five generations, with two consanguineous parents, one slightly 
      affected female, and 12 affected males with SBMA. We studied the five surviving 
      male patients and one surviving female carrier. The age at disease onset, 
      phenotypic features, and disease severity varied among the family members. DNA 
      analysis was performed on five individuals, belonging to five generations of the 
      family. Four affected males and a slightly affected female carrier were shown to 
      carry an expanded CAG repeat in the androgen receptor gene. This family report is 
      consistent with previous studies suggesting that SBMA may be present with a wide 
      clinical spectrum in affected family members. Further descriptions of SBMA 
      affected families with different ethnic backgrounds may assist in identifying 
      possible phenotypic and genetic features of the disease.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2 (DM1 and DM2) are forms of muscular dystrophy 
      that share similar clinical and molecular manifestations, such as myotonia, 
      muscle weakness, cardiac anomalies, cataracts, and the presence of defined 
      RNA-containing foci in muscle nuclei. DM2 is caused by an expansion of the 
      tetranucleotide CCTG repeat within the first intron of ZNF9, although the 
      mechanism by which the expanded nucleotide repeat causes the debilitating 
      symptoms of DM2 is unclear. Conflicting studies have led to two models for the 
      mechanisms leading to the problems associated with DM2. First, a gain-of-function 
      disease model hypothesizes that the repeat expansions in the transcribed RNA do 
      not directly affect ZNF9 function. Instead repeat-containing RNAs are thought to 
      sequester proteins in the nucleus, causing misregulation of normal cellular 
      processes. In the alternative model, the repeat expansions impair ZNF9 function 
      and lead to a decrease in the level of translation. Here we examine the normal in 
      vivo function of ZNF9. We report that ZNF9 associates with actively translating 
      ribosomes and functions as an activator of cap-independent translation of the 
      human ODC mRNA. This activity is mediated by direct binding of ZNF9 to the 
      internal ribosome entry site sequence (IRES) within the 5'UTR of ODC mRNA. ZNF9 
      can activate IRES-mediated translation of ODC within primary human myoblasts, and 
      this activity is reduced in myoblasts derived from a DM2 patient. These data 
      identify ZNF9 as a regulator of cap-independent translation and indicate that 
      ZNF9 activity may contribute mechanistically to the myotonic dystrophy type 2 
      phenotype.

TI  - Genetic diversity of O157:H7 and non-O157 verocytotoxigenic Escherichia coli from 
      Argentina inferred from multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis 
      (MLVA).
PG  - 212-7

AB  - Although serotype O157:H7 has been implicated in most cases of haemolytic-uraemic 
      syndrome (HUS), there is growing concern about non-O157 serotypes of 
      verocytotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC). Multiple-locus variable-number tandem 
      repeat analysis (MLVA) has been focused on the specific typing of O157:H7 
      isolates, but recently, a generic MLVA assay for E. coli and Shigella has been 
      developed. We performed a study of the polymorphism in 7 generic VNTR loci both 
      in VTEC O157:H7 and non-O157 isolates from Argentina, in order to asses the 
      ability of the method to type this group of isolates and to get insight into 
      their genetic diversity. Sixty-four isolates from cattle, patients with 
      diarrhoea, and contaminated food belonging to 8 different serotypes were studied. 
      All of them could be typed by this method and revealed 41 different MLVA 
      genotypes. The MLVA dendrogram showed 2 main clusters which corresponded to 
      O157:H7 and non-O157, respectively. Our results confirm the suitability of this 
      MLVA method for analyzing VTEC isolates belonging to several serotypes, both 
      O157:H7 as well as non-O157, highlight the genetic variability of the O157:H7 
      serotype and the need of additional research in order to find more VNTR loci that 
      could allow a higher discrimination among non-O157 VTEC.

TI  - Altered RNA splicing contributes to skeletal muscle pathology in Kennedy disease 
      knock-in mice.
PG  - 500-7
LID - 10.1242/dmm.003301 [doi]
AB  - Here, we used a mouse model of Kennedy disease, a degenerative disorder caused by 
      an expanded CAG repeat in the androgen receptor (AR) gene, to explore pathways 
      leading to cellular dysfunction. We demonstrate that male mice containing a 
      targeted Ar allele with 113 CAG repeats (AR113Q mice) exhibit hormone- and 
      glutamine length-dependent missplicing of Clcn1 RNA in skeletal muscle. Changes 
      in RNA splicing are associated with increased expression of the RNA-binding 
      protein CUGBP1. Furthermore, we show that skeletal muscle denervation in the 
      absence of a repeat expansion leads to increased CUGBP1 expression. However, this 
      induction of CUGBP1 is not sufficient to alter Clcn1 RNA splicing, indicating 
      that changes mediated by both denervation and AR113Q toxicity contribute to 
      altered RNA processing. To test this notion directly, we exogenously expressed 
      the AR in vitro and observed hormone-dependent changes in the splicing of 
      pre-mRNAs from a human cardiac troponin T minigene. These effects were notably 
      similar to changes mediated by RNA with expanded CUG tracts, but not CAG tracts, 
      highlighting unanticipated similarities between CAG and CUG repeat diseases. The 
      expanded glutamine AR also altered hormone-dependent splicing of a 
      calcitonin/calcitonin gene-related peptide minigene, suggesting that toxicity of 
      the mutant protein additionally affects RNA processing pathways that are distinct 
      from those regulated by CUGBP1. Our studies demonstrate the occurrence of 
      hormone-dependent alterations in RNA splicing in Kennedy disease models, and they 
      indicate that these changes are mediated by both the cell-autonomous effects of 
      the expanded glutamine AR protein and by alterations in skeletal muscle that are 
      secondary to denervation.

TI  - Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) modification of the androgen receptor 
      attenuates polyglutamine-mediated aggregation.
PG  - 21296-306
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M109.011494 [doi]
AB  - The neurodegenerative disorder spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy or Kennedy 
      disease is caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion within the androgen 
      receptor (AR) gene. The resulting expanded polyglutamine tract in the N-terminal 
      region of the receptor renders AR prone to ligand-dependent misfolding and 
      formation of oligomers and aggregates that are linked to neuronal toxicity. How 
      AR misfolding is influenced by post-translational modifications, however, is 
      poorly understood. AR is a target of SUMOylation, and this modification inhibits 
      AR activity in a promoter context-dependent manner. SUMOylation is up-regulated 
      in response to multiple forms of cellular stress and may therefore play an 
      important cytoprotective role. Consistent with this view, we find that gratuitous 
      enhancement of overall SUMOylation significantly reduced the formation of 
      polyglutamine-expanded AR aggregates without affecting the levels of the 
      receptor. Remarkably, this effect requires SUMOylation of AR itself because it 
      depends on intact AR SUMOylation sites. Functional analyses, however, indicate 
      that the protective effects of enhanced AR SUMOylation are not due to alterations 
      in AR transcriptional activity because a branched protein structure in the 
      appropriate context of the N-terminal region of AR is necessary to antagonize 
      aggregation but not for inhibiting AR transactivation. Remarkably, small 
      ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) attenuates AR aggregation through a unique 
      mechanism that does not depend on critical features essential for its interaction 
      with canonical SUMO binding motifs. Our findings therefore reveal a novel 
      function of SUMOylation and suggest that approaches that enhance AR SUMOylation 
      may be of clinical use in polyglutamine expansion diseases.

AB  - Numerous mutations of the human androgen receptor (AR) gene cause an intersexual 
      phenotype, called the androgen insensitivity syndrome. The intersexual phenotype 
      is also quite often diagnosed in dogs. The aim of this study was to conduct a 
      comparative analysis of the entire coding sequence (eight exons) of the AR gene 
      in healthy and four intersex dogs, as well as in three other canids (the red fox, 
      arctic fox and Chinese raccoon dog). The coding sequence of the studied species 
      appeared to be conserved (similarity above 97%) and polymorphism was found in 
      exon 1 only. Altogether, 2 SNPs were identified in healthy dogs, 14 in red foxes, 
      16 in arctic foxes and 6 were found in Chinese raccoon dogs, respectively. 
      Moreover, a variable number of tandem repeats (CAG and CAA), encoding an array of 
      glutamines, was also observed in this exon. The CAA codon numbers were invariable 
      within species, but the CAG repeats were polymorphic. The highest number of the 
      CAG and CAA repeats was found in dogs (from 40 to 42) and the observed 
      variability was similar in intersex and healthy dogs. In the other canids the 
      variability fell within the following ranges: 29-37 (red fox), 37-39 (arctic fox) 
      and 29-32 (Chinese raccoon dog). In addition, a polymorphic microsatellite marker 
      in intron 2 was found in the dog, red fox and Chinese raccoon dog. It was 
      concluded that the polymorphism level of the AR gene in the dog was lower than in 
      the other canids and none of the detected polymorphisms, including variability of 
      the CAG tandem repeats, could be related with the intersexual phenotype of the 
      studied dogs.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a genetic disorder linked to a (CTG)(n) repeat 
      expansion in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. Upon transcription in 
      the nucleus, the CUG repeats form a stable RNA stem-loop that sequesters the 
      RNA-binding protein MBNL1 from its normal function in the cell. MBNL1 regulates 
      the alternative splicing of many pre-mRNAs, and upon MBNL1's sequestration, the 
      alternative splicing of many genes is mis-regulated, leading to disease symptoms. 
      MBNL1 is known to bind directly to at least 3 of the pre-mRNAs that it regulates, 
      but how MBNL1 binding mechanistically regulates alternative splicing is unclear. 
      Here, we demonstrate that MBNL1 controls the splicing of exon 5 in the cardiac 
      troponin T (cTNT) pre-mRNA by competing directly with the essential splicing 
      factor U2AF65 for binding at the 3' end of intron 4. When U2AF65 is prevented 
      from binding to the pre-mRNA, the U2 snRNP can no longer be recruited and the 
      following exon is skipped. Furthermore, MBNL1 and U2AF65 appear to compete by 
      binding to mutually exclusive RNA structures. When bound by splicing factors, the 
      3' end of intron 4 can form either a stem-loop or a single-stranded structure. 
      MBNL1 binds a portion of the intron as a stem-loop, whereas U2AF65 binds the same 
      region in a single-strand structure. Mutations that strengthen the stem-loop 
      decrease U2AF65 binding affinity and also repress exon 5 inclusion, independently 
      of MBNL1. Thus, U2AF65 binding can be blocked either by MBNL1 binding or by the 
      stabilization of RNA secondary structure.

AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an inherited neuromuscular disorder 
      caused by a polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansion in the androgen receptor (AR). 
      PolyQ-AR neurotoxicity may involve generation of an N-terminal truncation 
      fragment, as such peptides occur in SBMA patients and mouse models. To elucidate 
      the basis of SBMA, we expressed N-terminal truncated AR in motor neuron-derived 
      cells and primary cortical neurons. Accumulation of polyQ-AR truncation fragments 
      in the cytosol resulted in neurodegeneration and apoptotic, caspase-dependent 
      cell death. Using primary neurons from mice transgenic or deficient for 
      apoptosis-related genes, we determined that polyQ-AR apoptotic activation is 
      fully dependent on Bax. Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was required for apoptotic 
      pathway activation through phosphorylation of c-Jun. Expression of polyQ-AR in 
      DP5/Hrk null neurons yielded significant protection against apoptotic activation, 
      but absence of Bim did not provide protection, apparently due to compensatory 
      upregulation of DP5/Hrk or other BH3-only proteins. Misfolded AR protein in the 
      cytosol thus initiates a cascade of events beginning with JNK and culminating in 
      Bax-dependent, intrinsic pathway activation, mediated in part by DP5/Hrk. As 
      apoptotic mediators are candidates for toxic fragment generation and other 
      cellular processes linked to neuron dysfunction, delineation of the apoptotic 
      activation pathway induced by polyQ-expanded AR may shed light on the pathogenic 
      cascade in SBMA and other motor neuron diseases.

PG  - 113-20

AB  - With this paper, we deliberately challenge the prevailing neurocentric theory of 
      the etiology of spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). We offer data supporting 
      an alternative view that androgen receptor (AR) acts in skeletal muscles to cause 
      the symptoms of SBMA. While SBMA has been linked to a CAG repeat expansion in the 
      AR gene and mutant AR is presumed to act in motoneurons to cause SBMA, we find 
      that over-expression of wild type AR solely in skeletal muscle fibers results in 
      the same androgen-dependent disease phenotype as when mutant AR is broadly 
      expressed. Like other recent SBMA mouse models, transgenic (tg) females in our 
      model exhibit a motor phenotype only when exposed to androgens, and this motor 
      dysfunction is independent of motoneuronal or muscle fiber cell death. Muscles 
      from symptomatic females also show denervation-like changes in gene expression 
      comparable to a knock-in model of SBMA. Furthermore, once androgen treatment 
      ends, tg females rapidly recover motor function and muscle gene expression, 
      demonstrating the strict androgen-dependence of the disease phenotype in our 
      model. Our results argue that SBMA may be caused by AR acting in muscle.

TI  - Androgens inhibit androgen receptor promoter activation in motor neurons.
PG  - 395-404
LID - 10.1016/j.nbd.2008.11.007 [doi]
AB  - The androgen receptor (AR), a ligand-activated transcription factor, has been 
      found mutated in several human diseases. While some mutations reduce, others 
      potentiate AR functions generating different endocrine dysfunctions. A peculiar 
      AR mutation, the CAG-repeat expansion encoding the AR-polyglutamine (polyQ) 
      tract, generates a neurotoxic gain-of-function(s) in this mutant AR (ARpolyQ). 
      This leads to the motor neuronal disease Spinal and Bulbar Muscular Atrophy 
      (SBMA), in which the transcriptional AR down-regulation might have beneficial 
      impacts. We thus analysed the AR-promoter/5'-UTR activation and androgenic 
      regulation, demonstrating that its constitutive activity is considerably high in 
      motor neurons (NSC34). Testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), but not 
      estradiol, inhibited AR promoter activation. Thus AR establishes a negative 
      control on its own functions, in opposition to that described on classical 
      androgen-responsive elements (ARE) of the AR gene. The AR/DNA interaction is 
      required for this action, since DHT does not inhibit AR expression in presence of 
      an AR (AR_DeltaPhe581) lacking DNA binding activity. The minimal inhibitory 
      region spans from -740/+570 bp, where "in silico" analysis showed a putative AR 
      binding site; deletion studies excluded that this ARE may be involved in this 
      inhibition. A similar effect of DHT has also been observed in AR negative 
      prostate cancer DU145 cell line transfected with the AR. Moreover, androgens 
      down-regulate the expression of the endogenous AR gene in an AR positive prostate 
      cancer LNCaP cell line. Interestingly, in immortalized motor neurons, ARpolyQ was 
      much less effective than wtAR on the positive androgenic control on classical 
      AREs, while ARpolyQ and wtAR had similar inhibitory properties on the AR 
      promoter/5'-UTR activation. This strongly suggests that, in motor neurons, the 
      two types of AR gene androgenic regulation involve different mechanisms. Thus, by 
      acting on the AR promoter it would be possible to reduce AR levels in motor 
      neurons, providing novel approaches to treat SBMA.

TI  - CTCF cis-regulates trinucleotide repeat instability in an epigenetic manner: a

AB  - At least 25 inherited disorders in humans result from microsatellite repeat 
      expansion. Dramatic variation in repeat instability occurs at different disease 
      loci and between different tissues; however, cis-elements and trans-factors 
      regulating the instability process remain undefined. Genomic fragments from the 
      human spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) locus, containing a highly unstable 
      CAG tract, were previously introduced into mice to localize cis-acting 
      "instability elements," and revealed that genomic context is required for repeat 
      instability. The critical instability-inducing region contained binding sites for 
      CTCF -- a regulatory factor implicated in genomic imprinting, chromatin 
      remodeling, and DNA conformation change. To evaluate the role of CTCF in repeat 
      instability, we derived transgenic mice carrying SCA7 genomic fragments with CTCF 
      binding-site mutations. We found that CTCF binding-site mutation promotes triplet 
      repeat instability both in the germ line and in somatic tissues, and that CpG 
      methylation of CTCF binding sites can further destabilize triplet repeat 
      expansions. As CTCF binding sites are associated with a number of highly unstable 
      repeat loci, our findings suggest a novel basis for demarcation and regulation of 
      mutational hot spots and implicate CTCF in the modulation of genetic repeat 
      instability.

AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an adult-onset motor neuron disease 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the androgen receptor gene. Because the 
      progression of SBMA is slow, it is plausible to identify biomarkers that monitor 
      disease course for therapeutic development. To verify whether the 6-min walk test 
      (6MWT) is a biomarker of SBMA, we performed the 6MWT in 35 genetically confirmed 
      patients and in 29 age-matched healthy controls. The walk distance covered within 
      6 min (6MWD) was significantly less in SBMA than it was in controls (323.3 +/- 
      143.9 m and 637.6 +/- 94.2 m, respectively; P < 0.001). In test-retest analysis, 
      the intraclass correlation coefficient for the 6MWD was high in SBMA patients (r 
      = 0.982). In a 1-year follow-up the 6MWD significantly decreased at a rate of 
      11.3% per year. Our observations suggest that the 6MWT is a biomarker that can be 
      used to monitor progression of motor impairment in SBMA.

TI  - Rare association of antisynthetase syndrome and Kennedy's disease.
PG  - 1329-31
LID - 10.1007/s10067-008-0946-5 [doi]
AB  - Antisynthetase syndrome is a type of Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathy (IIM) 
      associated with anti-Jo1 antibody. Kennedy's disease or X-linked spinal and 
      bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a rare neuromuscular disease. We describe the 
      case report of a 53-year-old man who presented with proximal muscle weakness and 
      a history of bilateral hand tremor. Initial physical examination demonstrated 
      "mechanic's hands", Raynaud's phenomenon, having elevated creatine kinase and 
      lactate dehydrogenase levels and anti-Jo1 antibody positivity. His muscle biopsy 
      demonstrated inflammatory infiltrate characteristic of IIM. Considering these 
      findings, we reached the diagnosis of antisynthetase syndrome and commenced 
      immunosuppressive therapy. On follow-up examination, he had developed dysphagia, 
      and his tremor had worsened. His electroneurogram result was characteristic of 
      Kennedy's disease, and the genetic test result showed an allele with 44 CAG 
      repeat expansion in the androgen receptor gene of the X chromosome. This 
      confirmed that in addition to antisynthetase syndrome, he also had Kennedy's 
      disease. This patient now receives immunology and neurology follow-up. His 
      symptoms have improved with low dose corticosteroids, propranolol for tremor, 
      vitamin B supplementation, and physiotherapy. This article presents a rare case 
      report of a patient with concurrent antisynthetase syndrome and Kennedy's 
      disease, both of which lead to elevated creatine kinase levels and muscle 
      weakness, thus, underpinning the importance of careful follow-up of patients with 
      IIM and maintaining an open mind to other diagnoses when faced with refractory 
      and/or new symptoms.

TI  - Pathophysiologic insights into motor axonal function in Kennedy disease.
PG  - 1828-35
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Kennedy disease (KD), or spinobulbomuscular atrophy, is a slowly 
      progressive inherited neurodegenerative disorder, marked by prominent 
      fasciculations that typically precede the development of other symptoms. Although 
      the genetic basis of KD relates to triplet (CAG) repeat expansion in the androgen 
      receptor (AR) gene on the X chromosome, the mechanisms underlying the clinical 
      presentation in KD have yet to be established. Consequently, the present study 
      applied axonal excitability techniques to investigate the pathophysiologic 
      mechanisms associated with KD. METHODS: Peripheral nerve excitability studies 
      were undertaken in 7 patients with KD with compound muscle action potentials 
      (CMAP) recorded from the right abductor pollicis brevis. RESULTS: 
      Strength-duration time constant (KD 0.54 +/- 0.03 msec; controls, 0.41 +/- 0.02 
      msec, p < 0.01) and the hyperpolarizing current/threshold gradient (KD 0.42 +/- 
      0.01; controls, 0.37 +/- 0.01, p < 0.05) were significantly increased in KD. 
      Strength-duration time constant correlated with the CMAP amplitude (R = 0.68) and 
      the fasciculation frequency (R = 0.62). Threshold electrotonus revealed greater 
      changes in response to subthreshold depolarizing (KD TEd [90 to 100 msec], 50.75 
      +/- 1.98%; controls TEd [90 to 100 msec], 45.67 +/- 0.67%, p < 0.01) and 
      hyperpolarizing (KD TEh [90 to 100 msec], 128.5 +/- 6.9%; controls TEh [90 to 100 
      msec], 120.5 +/- 2.4%) conditioning pulses. Measurements of refractoriness, 
      superexcitability, and late subexcitability changed appropriately for axonal 
      hyperpolarization, perhaps reflecting the effects of increased ectopic activity. 
      CONCLUSION: In total, the increase in the strength-duration time constant may be 
      the primary event, occurring early in course of the disease, contributing to the 
      development of axonal hyperexcitability in Kennedy disease, and thereby to the 
      generation of fasciculations, a characteristic hallmark of the disease.

TI  - Overexpression of wild-type androgen receptor in muscle recapitulates 
      polyglutamine disease.
PG  - 18259-64
AB  - We created transgenic mice that overexpress WT androgen receptor (AR) exclusively 
      in their skeletal muscle fibers. Unexpectedly, these mice display 
      androgen-dependent muscle weakness and early death, show changes in muscle 
      morphology and gene expression consistent with neurogenic atrophy, and exhibit a 
      loss of motor axons. These features reproduce those seen in models of Kennedy 
      disease, a polyglutamine expansion disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in 
      the AR gene. These findings demonstrate that toxicity in skeletal muscles is 
      sufficient to cause motoneuron disease and indicate that overexpression of the WT 
      AR can exert toxicity comparable with the polyglutamine expanded protein. This 
      model has two clear implications for Kennedy disease: (i) mechanisms affecting AR 
      gene expression may cause neuromuscular symptoms similar to those of Kennedy 
      disease and (ii) therapeutic approaches targeting skeletal muscle may provide 
      effective treatments for this disease.

TI  - Pure bulbar motor neuron involvement linked to an abnormal CAG repeat expansion 
      in the androgen receptor gene.
PG  - 40-2
AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an X-linked adult motor neuron 
      disorder caused by an abnormal CAG-repeat expansion in the first exon of the 
      androgen receptor gene. This disease associates progressive lower motor neuron 
      affection and endocrine disturbances. Bulbar symptoms appear usually late in the 
      clinical course but clinical heterogeneity is demonstrated. We report the case of 
      a 62-year-old male with a 10-year history of progressive bulbar involvement 
      related to an abnormal CAG-repeat expansion in the androgen receptor gene. This 
      atypical phenotype led us to discuss the role of some genetic or environmental 
      factors in SBMA.

TI  - Evaluation of genetic variations in the androgen and estrogen metabolic pathways 
      as risk factors for sporadic and familial prostate cancer.
PG  - 969-78
AB  - Previous studies suggest that enzymes involved in the androgen metabolic pathway 
      are susceptibility factors for prostate cancer. Estrogen metabolites functioning 
      as genotoxins have also been proposed as risk factors. In this study, we 
      systematically tested the hypothesis that common genetic variations for those 
      enzymes involved in the androgen and estrogen metabolic pathways increase risk 
      for sporadic and familial prostate cancer. From these two pathways, 46 
      polymorphisms (34 single nucleotide polymorphisms, 10 short tandem repeat 
      polymorphisms, and 2 null alleles) in 25 genes were tested for possible 
      associations. Those genes tested included PRL, LHB, CYP11A1, HSD3B1, HSD3B2, 
      HSD17B2, CYP17, SRD5A2, AKR1C3, UGT2B15, AR, SHBG, and KLK3 from the androgen 
      pathway and CYP19, HSD17B1, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, COMT, GSTP1, GSTT1, GSTM1, 
      NQO1, ESR1, and ESR2 from the estrogen pathway. A case-control study design was 
      used with two sets of cases: familial cases with a strong prostate cancer family 
      history (n = 438 from 178 families) and sporadic cases with a negative prostate 
      cancer family history (n = 499). The controls (n = 493) were derived from a 
      population-based collection. Our results provide suggestive findings for an 
      association with either familial or sporadic prostate cancer with polymorphisms 
      in four genes: AKR1C3, HSD17B1, NQO1, and GSTT1. Additional suggestive findings 
      for an association with clinical variables (disease stage, grade, and/or node 
      status) were observed for single nucleotide polymorphisms in eight genes: HSD3B2, 
      SRD5A2, SHBG, ESR1, CYP1A1, CYP1B1, GSTT1, and NQO1. However, none of the 
      findings were statistically significant after appropriate corrections for 
      multiple comparisons. Given that the point estimates for the odds ratio for each 
      of these polymorphisms are <2.0, much larger sample sizes will be required for 
      confirmation.

TI  - Mutation in CEP290 discovered for cat model of human retinal degeneration.
PG  - 211-20
AB  - A mutation in the CEP290 gene is reported in a cat pedigree segregating for 
      autosomal recessive (AR) late-onset photoreceptor degeneration (rdAc). An initial 
      screen of 39 candidate genes and genomic locations failed to detect linkage to 
      cat rdAc. Linkage was ultimately established on cat B4 with 15 simple tandem 
      repeat markers (logarithm of odds [LOD] range 4.83-15.53, Theta = 0.0), in a 
      region demonstrating conserved synteny to human chromosome 12, 84.9-90.63 Mb. The 
      sequence of 10 genes with feline retinal expression was examined in affected and 
      unaffected individuals. A single-nucleotide polymorphism was characterized in 
      intron 50 of CEP290 (IVS50 + 9T>G) that creates a strong canonical splice donor 
      site, resulting in a 4-bp insertion and frameshift in the mRNA transcript, with 
      subsequent introduction of a stop codon and premature truncation of the protein. 
      A population genetic survey of 136 cats demonstrated that the rdAc mutation is in 
      low frequency in Abyssinian populations (0.13, Sweden; 0.07, United States) and 
      absent in breeds of non-Abyssinian heritage. Mutations in CEP290 have recently 
      been shown to cause two human diseases, Joubert syndrome, a syndromic retinal 
      degeneration, and Leber's congenital amaurosis, an AR early-onset retinal 
      dystrophy. Human AR retinitis pigmentosa is among the most common causes of 
      retinal degeneration and blindness, with no therapeutic intervention available. 
      This identification of a large animal model for human retinal blindness offers 
      considerable promise in developing gene-based therapies.

TI  - Muscle chloride channel dysfunction in two mouse models of myotonic dystrophy.
PG  - 79-94
AB  - Muscle degeneration and myotonia are clinical hallmarks of myotonic dystrophy 
      type 1 (DM1), a multisystemic disorder caused by a CTG repeat expansion in the 3' 
      untranslated region of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) gene. 
      Transgenic mice engineered to express mRNA with expanded (CUG)(250) repeats 
      (HSA(LR) mice) exhibit prominent myotonia and altered splicing of muscle chloride 
      channel gene (Clcn1) transcripts. We used whole-cell patch clamp recordings and 
      nonstationary noise analysis to compare and biophysically characterize the 
      magnitude, kinetics, voltage dependence, and single channel properties of the 
      skeletal muscle chloride channel (ClC-1) in individual flexor digitorum brevis 
      (FDB) muscle fibers isolated from 1-3-wk-old wild-type and HSA(LR) mice. The 
      results indicate that peak ClC-1 current density at -140 mV is reduced >70% 
      (-48.5 +/- 3.6 and -14.0 +/- 1.6 pA/pF, respectively) and the kinetics of channel 
      deactivation increased in FDB fibers obtained from 18-20- d-old HSA(LR) mice. 
      Nonstationary noise analysis revealed that the reduction in ClC-1 current density 
      in HSA(LR) FDB fibers results from a large reduction in ClC-1 channel density 
      (170 +/- 21 and 58 +/- 11 channels/pF in control and HSA(LR) fibers, 
      respectively) and a modest decrease in maximal channel open probability(0.91 +/- 
      0.01 and 0.75 +/- 0.03, respectively). Qualitatively similar results were 
      observed for ClC-1 channel activity in knockout mice for muscleblind-like 1 
      (Mbnl1(DeltaE3/DeltaE3)), a second murine model of DM1 that exhibits prominent 
      myotonia and altered Clcn1 splicing (Kanadia et al., 2003). These results support 
      a molecular mechanism for myotonia in DM1 in which a reduction in both the number 
      of functional sarcolemmal ClC-1 and maximal channel open probability, as well as 
      an acceleration in the kinetics of channel deactivation, results from CUG 
      repeat-containing mRNA molecules sequestering Mbnl1 proteins required for proper 
      CLCN1 pre-mRNA splicing and chloride channel function.

TI  - Nonprogressive juvenile-onset spinal muscular atrophy: A clinico-radiological and 
      CAG repeat study of androgen receptor gene.
PG  - 24-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Occurrence of nonprogressive juvenile-onset spinal muscular atrophy 
      (SMA) predominantly in males suggests a possibility of X-linked disorder but 
      there is no such report addressing this problem. AIMS: To evaluate CAG repeat 
      expansion of androgen receptor (AR) gene in patients with nonprogressive 
      juvenile-onset SMA. SETTING: Tertiary medical teaching institute. SUBJECTS AND 
      METHODS: Patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of nonprogressive 
      juvenile-onset SMA were included. Detailed clinical evaluation and pedigree 
      charting were done in all. Nerve conduction study, electromyography and cervical 
      spinal MRI were carried out. From peripheral venous blood, DNA was separated and 
      AR gene CAG repeat exon polymorphism was assayed using polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR) in conjugation with genotyping and Gene scan soft ware. Number of CAG 
      repeats was compared with normal controls. RESULTS: 25 patients with 
      nonprogressive juvenile-onset SMA from 24 families were included and their mean 
      age was 22.2 years. Age at the time of disease onset ranged between 15 and 30 
      years with a mean duration of illness 2.6 years. None of the patients had 
      testicular atrophy or gynecomastia. C7-T1 myotomal wasting and weakness although 
      was unilateral to begin with but became bilateral in 16 and 4 more patients had 
      evidences of subclinical involvement of the other side as revealed by EMG. Spinal 
      MRI revealed cord atrophy at C6-8 vertebral level in 16 patients. CAG repeat 
      study of AR gene was carried out in 16 patients. The number of CAG repeats in 
      patients ranged between 15 and 39 (median 21) which were within the normal range. 
      CONCLUSION: Abnormal CAG repeat expansion of AR gene is not found in patients 
      with nonprogressive juvenile-onset SMA.

TI  - Reversal of RNA missplicing and myotonia after muscleblind overexpression in a 
      mouse poly(CUG) model for myotonic dystrophy.
PG  - 11748-53
AB  - RNA-mediated pathogenesis is a recently developed disease model that proposes 
      that certain types of mutant genes produce toxic transcripts that inhibit the 
      activities of specific proteins. This pathogenesis model was proposed first for 
      the neuromuscular disease myotonic dystrophy (DM), which is associated with the 
      expansion of structurally related (CTG)(n) and (CCTG)(n) microsatellites in two 
      unrelated genes. At the RNA level, these expansions form stable hairpins that 
      alter the pre-mRNA splicing activities of two antagonistic factor families, the 
      MBNL and CELF proteins. It is unclear which altered activity is primarily 
      responsible for disease pathogenesis and whether other factors and biochemical 
      pathways are involved. Here, we show that overexpression of Mbnl1 in vivo 
      mediated by transduction of skeletal muscle with a recombinant adeno-associated 
      viral vector rescues disease-associated muscle hyperexcitability, or myotonia, in 
      the HSA(LR) poly(CUG) mouse model for DM. Myotonia reversal occurs concurrently 
      with restoration of the normal adult-splicing patterns of four pre-mRNAs that are 
      misspliced during postnatal development in DM muscle. Our results support the 
      hypothesis that the loss of MBNL1 activity is a primary pathogenic event in the 
      development of RNA missplicing and myotonia in DM and provide a rationale for 
      therapeutic strategies designed either to overexpress MBNL1 or inhibit MBNL1 
      interactions with CUG and CCUG repeat expansions.

TI  - Loss of endogenous androgen receptor protein accelerates motor neuron 
      degeneration and accentuates androgen insensitivity in a mouse model of X-linked 
      spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.
PG  - 2225-38
AB  - X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA; Kennedy's disease) is a 
      polyglutamine (polyQ) disease in which the affected males suffer progressive 
      motor neuron degeneration accompanied by signs of androgen insensitivity, such as 
      gynecomastia and reduced fertility. SBMA is caused by CAG repeat expansions in 
      the androgen receptor (AR) gene resulting in the production of AR protein with an 
      extended glutamine tract. SBMA is one of nine polyQ diseases in which polyQ 
      expansion is believed to impart a toxic gain-of-function effect upon the mutant 
      protein, and initiate a cascade of events that culminate in neurodegeneration. 
      However, whether loss of a disease protein's normal function concomitantly 
      contributes to the neurodegeneration remains unanswered. To address this, we 
      examined the role of normal AR function in SBMA by crossing a highly 
      representative AR YAC transgenic mouse model with 100 glutamines (AR100) and a 
      corresponding control (AR20) onto an AR null (testicular feminization; Tfm) 
      background. Absence of endogenous AR protein in AR100Tfm mice had profound 
      effects upon neuromuscular and endocrine-reproductive features of this SBMA mouse 
      model, as AR100Tfm mice displayed accelerated neurodegeneration and severe 
      androgen insensitivity in comparison to AR100 littermates. Reduction in size and 
      number of androgen-sensitive motor neurons in the spinal cord of AR100Tfm mice 
      underscored the importance of AR action for neuronal health and survival. 
      Promoter-reporter assays confirmed that AR transactivation competence diminishes 
      in a polyQ length-dependent fashion. Our studies indicate that SBMA disease 
      pathogenesis, both in the nervous system and the periphery, involves two 
      simultaneous pathways: gain-of-function misfolded protein toxicity and loss of 
      normal protein function.

TI  - Clonal analysis of palmar fibromatosis: a study whether palmar fibromatosis is a 
      real tumor.
PG  - 21
AB  - BACKGROUND: Palmar fibromatosis that arises in the palmar soft tissue is 
      characterized by infiltrative growth with a tendency toward local recurrence but 
      does not metastasize. This study investigated the clonality of this process in 
      twelve female patients, each with a single lesion, by examining the pattern of 
      X-chromosome inactivation. METHODS: Hematoxylin and eosin stained sections of 
      formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were microdissected by laser capture 
      microdissection to obtain the proliferative spindle cells. Tumor cells were 
      isolated from the sections of rectum adenocarcinoma, and used for positive 
      control. The genomic DNAs was extracted with phenol-chloroform, digested with a 
      methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease HpaII, and amplified by polymerase 
      chain reaction (PCR), using primers targeted to a highly polymorphic short tandem 
      repeat (STR) of the human androgen receptor gene (HUMARA). RESULTS: Among the 
      twelve samples, three samples failed amplification, one sample showed 
      homozygosity which was not suitable for further analysis, eight samples were 
      successfully amplified, and showed a random X chromosome inactivation pattern, 
      suggesting polyclonality of these lesions. CONCLUSION: The current findings 
      suggest that palmar fibromatosis is a reactive proliferation rather than a clonal 
      neoplasm.

TI  - Natural history of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA): a study of 223 
      Japanese patients.
PG  - 1446-55
AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an adult-onset motoneuron disease 
      caused by a CAG-repeat expansion in the androgen receptor (AR) gene and for which 
      no curative therapy exists. However, since recent research may provide 
      opportunities for medical treatment, information concerning the natural history 
      of SBMA would be beneficial in planning future clinical trials. We investigated 
      the natural course of SBMA as assessed by nine activities of daily living (ADL) 
      milestones in 223 Japanese SBMA patients (mean age at data collection = 55.2 
      years; range = 30-87 years) followed from 1 to 20 years. All the patients were 
      diagnosed by genetic analysis. Hand tremor was an early event that was noticed at 
      a median age of 33 years. Muscular weakness occurred predominantly in the lower 
      limbs, and was noticed at a median age of 44 years, followed by the requirement 
      of a handrail to ascend stairs at 49, dysarthria at 50, dysphagia at 54, use of a 
      cane at 59 and a wheelchair at 61 years. Twenty-one of the patients developed 
      pneumonia at a median age of 62 and 15 of them died at a median age of 65 years. 
      The most common cause of death in these cases was pneumonia and respiratory 
      failure. The ages at onset of each ADL milestone were strongly correlated with 
      the length of CAG repeats in the AR gene. However CAG-repeat length did not 
      correlate with the time intervals between each ADL milestone, suggesting that 
      although the onset age of each ADL milestone depends on the CAG-repeat length in 
      the AR gene, the rate of disease progression does not. The levels of serum 
      testosterone, an important triggering factor for polyglutamine-mediated 
      motoneuron degeneration, were maintained at relatively high levels even at 
      advanced ages. These results provide beneficial information for future clinical 
      therapeutic trials, although further detailed prospective studies are also 
      needed.

TI  - Extracellular matrix protein 1 inhibits the activity of matrix metalloproteinase 
      9 through high-affinity protein/protein interactions.
PG  - 300-7
AB  - Extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1), an approximately 85-kDa glycoprotein with 
      broad tissue distribution, harbors mutations in lipoid proteinosis (LP), a 
      heritable disease characterized by reduplication of basement membranes and 
      hyalinization of dermis, associated with neurologic disorders. The mechanisms 
      leading from ECM1 mutations to LP phenotype are unknown. In this study, we 
      explored ECM1 protein-protein interactions utilizing yeast two-hybrid genetic 
      screen of human placental library, which identified nine interacting proteins, 
      including matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9). The interactions were confirmed by 
      beta-galactosidase assay with isolated clones and by co-immunoprecipitation which 
      narrowed the interacting segment in ECM1 to the C-terminal tandem repeat 2 (amino 
      acids 236-361). This peptide segment also inhibited MMP9 activity in a 
      gelatin-based ELISA assay. We propose that ECM1-mediated reduction in MMP9 
      proteolytic activity may have relevance to pathogenesis of LP.

TI  - Lipoprotein(a), lipids and proinflammatory cytokines in patients undergoing major 
      abdominal surgery.
PG  - 347-53
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aims were to investigate whether surgical stress can induce a 
      positive or negative lipoprotein(a) acute response, to determine any association 
      with apolipoprotein(a) phenotypes, and to establish whether any such response is 
      dependent on changes in lipids and proinflammatory cytokines. In addition, the 
      impact of interleukin (IL) 6 genetic variability on the cytokine response to 
      surgery was examined. METHODS: This prospective, observational study included 41 
      patients with cancer referred for abdominal surgery. Preoperative (T0) plasma 
      concentrations of lipoprotein(a), IL-6, tumour necrosis factor alpha, and serum 
      concentrations of transforming growth factor beta1 and lipids, were compared with 
      values obtained 5 h (T1), 24 h (T2) and 5 days (T3) after surgery. 
      Apolipoprotein(a) Kringle IV (KIV)-VNTR (variable-number tandem repeat) and IL-6 
      - 174 G/C polymorphisms were analysed. RESULTS: Lipoprotein(a) was found to act 
      as a negative acute-phase reactant (30.0 per cent reduction at T2) (P = 0.009). 
      Surgery had a more profound impact on subjects with low KIV-VNTR. After surgery, 
      lipoprotein(a) correlated significantly with corrected low-density lipoprotein 
      (LDL)-cholesterol (r = 0.408 at T2). IL-6 inversely correlated with 
      lipoprotein(a) (r = -0.321 at T1) and LDL-cholesterol (r = -0.418 at T1). The 
      IL-6 response could be predicted from a combination of the surgical severity and 
      -174 G/C genotype. CONCLUSION: Although temporal associations did not indicate 
      causality, these data provide a hypothesis to explain the inverse relationship 
      between lipoprotein(a) and IL-6.

TI  - Organization of the Mycoplasma synoviae WVU 1853T vlhA gene locus.
PG  - 53-7
AB  - Mycoplasma synoviae cause respiratory disease and synovitis in poultry. It has 
      two major membrane antigens of approximately 45 to 50 kDa, MSPA and MSPB. Both 
      MSPA and MSPB ar encoded by a single gene, vlhA (variable lipoprotein and 
      haemagglutinin), possibly with a post-translational cleavage generating the two 
      proteins. The vlhA gene belongs to a large multigene family, but only one vlhA 
      gene is expressed in any single cell; the other vlhA genes/fragments are 
      transcriptionally silent. In order to characterize the vlhA gene locus, DNA 
      fragments were cloned from three different M. synoviae WVU 1853(T) genomic DNA 
      libraries and their nucleotide sequences were fully or partially determined. 
      Analysis of the resultant nucleotide sequences identified a transcriptional 
      termination signal for the expressed vlhA gene, determined the genes located 
      downstream of the expressed vlhA gene and revealed that vlhA pseudogenes were 
      arranged as tandem repeats upstream of the expressed vlhA gene. In order to 
      determine whether vlhA was expressed as a monocistronic or polycistronic message, 
      RNA from two M. synoviae clones expressing truncated or full-length versions of 
      the vlhA gene product were purified and examined by northern blotting. Messages 
      corresponding to the full length of the vlhA gene (approximately 2.4 kb) were 
      detected in both clones, suggesting that truncation of the vlhA gene product was 
      probably post-transcriptional. These studies have revealed the organization of 
      the M. synoviae vlhA gene locus and established that the vlhA gene transcript is 
      monocistronic.

TI  - South Indian men with reduced CAG repeat length in the androgen receptor gene 
      have an increased risk of prostate cancer.
PG  - 254-257
LID - 10.1007/s10038-005-0346-5 [doi]
AB  - The androgen receptor (AR) gene possesses polymorphic CAG tandem repeats and the 
      repeat length has been inversely related to the risk of prostate cancer (PCa). 
      The distinct ethnic variation in the CAG repeat length may be correlated to 
      differences in PCa risk in different populations. To evaluate the CAG repeat 
      length in the AR gene and the implications for PCa, we screened 87 PCa patients 
      and 120 control subjects from South India. The mean CAG repeat length in PCa 
      patients was significantly smaller than that of controls (17.0 vs 20.7; P < 
      0.001). Men with < or = 19 CAG repeats had a significantly increased risk of 
      cancer compared to those with >19 CAG repeats (age-adjusted OR = 7.01; 95% CI = 
      3.52-13.94; P < 0.001). However, no significant association was observed between 
      CAG repeats and age of onset or prostate-specific antigen levels. Although there 
      was a trend towards shorter CAG repeat length in high grades of cancer, it was 
      not significant (P = 0.085). Thus, our results suggest an association between 
      short CAG repeats in the AR gene and PCa risk in South Indian men. Further, we 
      propose that CAG repeats could be used as a prognostic marker for PCa diagnosis.

TI  - Double trouble in hereditary neuropathy: concomitant mutations in the PMP-22 gene 
      and another gene produce novel phenotypes.
PG  - 112-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mutations in the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP-22) gene are the 
      most common cause of Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy and may rarely occur in 
      combination with other neurogenetic diseases. OBJECTIVE: To characterize 3 
      families having a mutation in PMP-22 in addition to another neurogenetic disease 
      mutation. DESIGN: Clinical, electrophysiologic, and genetic evaluations were made 
      of 3 families with more than 1 genetic neuromuscular disease. SETTING AND 
      PATIENTS: Family members were evaluated in neurogenetic and muscular dystrophy 
      clinics in a university medical center setting. RESULTS: Three unusual families 
      were found: (1) 2 young brothers each having a PMP-22 duplication and a missense 
      mutation in the GJB1 (Connexin-32) gene; (2) a 32-year-old woman having a PMP-22 
      duplication and a 1000-fold CTG repeat expansion in the DMPK gene (DM1 myotonic 
      dystrophy); and (3) a 39-year-old man with a PMP-22 deletion and a missense 
      mutation in the ABCD1 gene (adrenomyeloneuropathy). The mutations were 
      "additive," causing a more severe phenotype than expected with each individual 
      disease and coinciding with the important impact of each gene on peripheral nerve 
      function. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals having 2 separate mutations in neuromuscular 
      disease-related genes may develop unusually severe phenotypes. Neurologists 
      should be alert to this possibility.

PG  - S77-85
AB  - Recent advances in molecular genetic technology allow for detailed 
      characterization of genetic variation and easy cost-efficient accumulation of 
      such data, even for large human samples. One such advance that presents 
      incredible opportunities for identifying associations between genetic 
      polymorphisms and disease-related phenotypes is the ability to quickly type a 
      large number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Contributors to Group 10 
      of Genetic Analysis Workshop 14 explored the potential of SNP genotypes for the 
      association mapping of disease-related genes in family-based studies. Using both 
      real data involving alcoholism susceptibility, made available by the 
      Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA), and simulated data 
      involving personality-disorder susceptibility, group members investigated 
      specific methodological issues involved in association mapping, such as multiple 
      testing, single SNPs vs. combinations and haplotypes, and the effect of linkage 
      disequilibrium on SNP-based linkage; evaluated existing methodologies for 
      association mapping using SNPs, short-tandem repeats (STRs), or a combination of 
      the two; and introduced new or modified association-mapping methods, including a 
      gamma random effects (GRE) model and the quantitative trait linkage 
      disequilibrium (QTLD) test. These papers are unified by the application of 
      association-based methods to analyze SNPs, microsatellite markers, or both, to 
      identify chromosomal regions harboring genes that contribute to quantitative 
      endophenotype variation, and thus to disease risk. Their diversity attests to the 
      breadth and flexibility of association-mapping approaches to the genetics of 
      complex disease.

TI  - Extracellular matrix protein 1 interacts with the domain III of fibulin-1C and 1D 
      variants through its central tandem repeat 2.
PG  - 1327-33
AB  - Extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1), a widely expressed glycoprotein, has been 
      shown to harbor mutations in lipoid proteinosis (LP), an autosomal recessive 
      disorder characterized by profound alterations in the extracellular matrix of 
      connective tissue. The biological function of ECM1 and its role in the 
      pathomechanisms of LP are unknown. Fibulins comprise a family of extracellular 
      matrix components, and the prototype of this family, fibulin-1, is expressed in 
      various connective tissues and plays a role in developmental and pathologic 
      processes. In this study, we demonstrate that ECM1, and specifically the second 
      tandem repeat domain which is alternatively spliced, interacts with the 
      C-terminal segments of fibulins 1C and 1D splice variants which differ in their 
      C-terminal domain III. The interactions were detected by yeast two-hybrid genetic 
      system and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitations. Kinetics of the binding between 
      ECM1 and fibulin-1D, measured by biosensor assay, revealed a K(d) of 5.71 x 
      10(-8) M, indicating a strong protein-protein interaction. Since distinct splice 
      variants of ECM1 and fibulin-1 have been shown to be co-expressed in tissues 
      affected in LP, we propose that altered ECM1/fibulin-1 interactions may play a 
      role in the pathogenesis of this disease as well as in a number of processes 
      involving the extracellular matrix of connective tissues.

TI  - Altered mRNA splicing of the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor and 
      sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase in myotonic dystrophy type 1.
PG  - 2189-200
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a debilitating multisystemic disorder caused 
      by a CTG repeat expansion in the DMPK gene. Aberrant splicing of several genes 
      has been reported to contribute to some symptoms of DM1, but the cause of muscle 
      weakness in DM1 and elevated Ca2+ concentrations in cultured DM muscle cells is 
      unknown. Here, we investigated the alternative splicing of mRNAs of two major 
      proteins of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1) and 
      sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) 1 or 2. The fetal 
      variants, ASI(-) of RyR1 which lacks residue 3481-3485, and SERCA1b which differs 
      at the C-terminal were significantly increased in skeletal muscles from DM1 
      patients and the transgenic mouse model of DM1 (HSA(LR)). In addition, a novel 
      variant of SERCA2 was significantly decreased in DM1 patients. The total amount 
      of mRNA for RyR1, SERCA1 and SERCA2 in DM1 and the expression levels of their 
      proteins in HSA(LR) mice were not significantly different. However, heterologous 
      expression of ASI(-) in cultured cells showed decreased affinity for 
      [3H]ryanodine but similar Ca2+ dependency, and decreased channel activity in 
      single-channel recording when compared with wild-type (WT) RyR1. In support of 
      this, RyR1-knockout myotubes expressing ASI(-) exhibited a decreased incidence of 
      Ca2+ oscillations during caffeine exposure compared with that observed for 
      myotubes expressing WT-RyR1. We suggest that aberrant splicing of RyR1 and SERCA1 
      mRNAs might contribute to impaired Ca2+ homeostasis in DM1 muscle.

TI  - Colocalization of muscleblind with RNA foci is separable from mis-regulation of 
      alternative splicing in myotonic dystrophy.
PG  - 2923-33
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type I (DM1), which is caused by a non-coding CTG-repeat 
      expansion in the dystrophia myotonica-protein kinase (DMPK) gene, is an 
      RNA-mediated disease. Expanded CUG repeats in transcripts of mutant DMPK form 
      nuclear foci that recruit muscleblind-like (MBNL) proteins, a family of 
      alternative splicing factors. Although transcripts of mutant DMPK and MBNL 
      proteins accumulate in nuclear RNA foci, it is not clear whether foci formation 
      is required for splicing mis-regulation. Here, we use a co-transfection strategy 
      to show that both CUG and CAG repeats form RNA foci that colocalize with green 
      fluorescent protein (GFP)-MBNL1 and endogenous MBNL1. However, only CUG repeats 
      alter splicing of the two tested pre-mRNAs, cardiac troponin T (cTNT) and insulin 
      receptor (IR). Using FRAP, we demonstrate that GFP-MBNL1 in CUG and CAG foci have 
      similar half-times of recovery and fractions of immobile molecules, suggesting 
      that GFP-MBNL1 is bound by both CUG and CAG repeats. We also find an immobile 
      fraction of GFP-MBNL1 in DM1 fibroblasts and a similar rapid exchange in 
      endogenous CUG RNA foci. Therefore, formation of RNA foci and disruption of 
      MBNL1-regulated splicing are separable events.

TI  - CAG repeat polymorphism in the androgen receptor (AR) gene of SBMA patients and a

PG  - 237-9
AB  - Spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an X-linked form of motor neuron disease 
      characterized by progressive atrophy of the muscles, dysphagia, dysarthria and 
      mild androgen insensitivity. SBMA is caused by CAG repeat expansion in the 
      androgen receptor gene. CAG repeat polymorphism was analysed in a Polish control 
      group (n = 150) and patients suspected of SBMA (n = 60). Normal and abnormal 
      ranges of CAG repeats were established in the control group and in 21 patients 
      whose clinical diagnosis of SBMA was molecularly confirmed. The ranges are 
      similar to those reported for other populations.

TI  - Transgenic mice expressing CUG-BP1 reproduce splicing mis-regulation observed in 
      myotonic dystrophy.
PG  - 1539-47
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type I (DM1) is an RNA-mediated disease caused by a non-coding 
      CTG repeat expansion. A key feature of the RNA-mediated pathogenesis model for DM 
      is the disrupted splicing of specific pre-mRNA targets. A link has been 
      established between splicing regulation by CUG-BP1, a member of the CELF family 
      of proteins, and DM1 pathogenesis. To determine whether increased CUG-BP1 
      function was sufficient to model DM, transgenic mice overexpressing CUG-BP1 
      (MCKCUG-BP1) in heart and skeletal muscle, two tissues affected in DM1, were 
      generated. Histological and electron microscopic analyses of skeletal muscle 
      reveal common pathological features with DM tissues: chains of central nuclei, 
      degenerating fibers and centralized NADH reactivity. MCKCUG-BP1 mice have 
      disrupted splicing of three CELF target pre-mRNAs, cardiac troponin T (Tnnt2), 
      myotubularin-related 1 gene (Mtmr1) and the muscle-specific chloride channel 
      (Clcn1), consistent with that observed in DM heart and skeletal muscle. The 
      results are consistent with a mechanism for DM pathogenesis in which expanded 
      repeats result in increased CUG-BP1 activity and/or other CELF family members and 
      have trans-dominant effects on specific pre-mRNA targets.

TI  - The presence of clonal cell subpopulations in peripheral blood and bone marrow of 
      patients with refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia but not in 
      patients with refractory anemia may reflect a multistep pathogenesis of 
      myelodysplasia.
PG  - 371-9
AB  - A clonal origin of hematopoiesis was studied by investigation of X-chromosome 
      inactivation patterns (XCIP) in isolated granulocyte, CD14(+) and CD3(+) 
      subpopulations obtained from bone marrow and peripheral blood of 36 female 
      patients with primary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Clonality was assessed by 
      PCR amplification of polymorphic short tandem repeats of the human androgen 
      receptor (HUMARA) gene and by investigation of silent polymorphism of iduronate 
      sulphatase (IDS) or p55 genes. On the basis of results in a control group of 20 
      healthy age related females, a ratio of at least 9:1 between the two alleles was 
      considered a significant marker of monoclonal hematopoiesis. Ten of the 11 
      patients with advanced forms of MDS (RAEB, RAEB-T, CMML) had clonal granulocytes 
      and CD14(+) cells in peripheral blood. In patients with early disease, only 2 out 
      of 11 patients (18%) with RA or RARS, according to WHO classification, had clonal 
      granulocytes and CD14(+) cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow and 2 other 
      patients with 5q-syndrome exhibited extremely oligoclonal granulocyte 
      subpopulation in bone marrow. In contrast, we found clonal granulocytes in 12 out 
      of 14 patients (86%) with refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD) 
      and 8 of them simultanously exhibited clonal CD14(+) cells. Estimated 3 years 
      survival of patients with early disease and clonal cell subpopulations was 61% as 
      compared with 88% in patients without clonal hematopoiesis. Karyotype 
      abnormalities were detected in 11 of the 25 females with early disease. Clonal 
      patterns were present in 7 out of 8 patients with abberations diagnosed by 
      routine cytogenetics, nevertheless, FISH revealed 5q deletion in 3 patients 
      without signs of clonality in XCIP assay. No correlation was found between the 
      presence of clonal subpopulations and the degree of telomere shortening in early 
      MDS. Despite some limitations, the measurement of XCIP remains a sensitive tool 
      for diagnosis of the first transforming mutation in the clonal development of MDS 
      especially when combined with FISH and when an age related group is used to 
      establish an appropriate allele ratio to exclude constitutional or acquired 
      skewing. The occurrence of clonal cell subpopulations in most of the RCMD 
      patients in contrast to RA may reflect a proposed multistep pathogenesis of MDS 
      with dysplastic changes limited to erythropoiesis in early step and with 
      subsequent development of multilineage dysplasia. The results also support the 
      usefulness of separation of RCMD from 'pure' RA; however, a more complex insight 
      combining different molecular techniques performed in a large number of patients 
      is needed for refined classification of MDS on the basis of new molecular 
      prognostic factors and for indication of more effective targeted therapy.

TI  - GGC and StuI polymorphism on the androgen receptor gene in endometrial cancer 
      patients.
PG  - 100-4
AB  - Androgens have an anti-proliferative effect on endometrial cells. Human androgen 
      receptor (AR) gene contains two polymorphic short tandem repeats of GGC and CAG, 
      and a single-nucleotide polymorphism on exon 1 that is recognized by the 
      restriction enzyme, StuI. Prior studies have shown that the lengths of the CAG 
      repeat are inversely and linearly related to AR activity and associated with 
      endometrial cancer. However, little is known about the GGC repeat and the StuI 
      polymorphism of the AR gene. Thus, we investigated whether these AR polymorphisms 
      are risk factors for endometrial cancer. To test this hypothesis, the genetic 
      distributions of these polymorphisms were investigated in blood samples from 
      endometrial cancer patients and healthy controls. The allelic and genotyping 
      profiles were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), PCR-restriction 
      fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), and direct DNA sequencing, and analyzed 
      statistically. The GGC repeat was significantly longer in endometrial cancer 
      patients as compared to normal healthy controls. In general, an increased risk of 
      endometrial cancer was found with increasing GGC repeat. The relative risk for 
      the 17 GGC repeat was greater than 4, as compared to controls. However, the StuI 
      polymorphism was not significantly different between patients and controls. The 
      findings suggest that increased numbers of GGC repeat on the AR gene may be a 
      risk factor for endometrial cancer.

TI  - Association of a major protein antigen of Mycoplasma arthritidis with virulence.
PG  - 245-9
AB  - Mycoplasma arthritidis causes acute polyarthritis in rats and chronic 
      proliferative arthritis in mice. M. arthritidis-induced arthritis serves as a 
      model for arthritis caused by infectious agents and as a model for examining the 
      role of the superantigen MAM (M. arthritidis T-cell mitogen) in the development 
      of autoimmunity. M. arthritidis strain 158-1 is a spontaneous mutant of strain 
      158 that has a drastic reduction in virulence. We show that the mutant is missing 
      a major antigen of 47 kDa (P47) and has acquired a protein of 67 kDa (P67). P47 
      and P67 partitioned into the detergent phase by extraction with Triton X-114. 
      Coomassie blue staining of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels show that 
      P67 is produced in abundance. Analysis of gel-purified P67 by mass spectrometry 
      led to its identification as a lipoprotein (the open reading frame [ORF] 619 gene 
      product) predicted from the genome sequence of M. arthritidis. PCR analysis of 
      genomic DNA from 158 and 158-1 indicates that P47 and P67 are encoded by the same 
      ORF 619 gene and differ only in the number of repeats in a tandem repeat region. 
      By two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel analysis, no protein differences were 
      detectable between 158 and 158-1 other than P47 and P67. Collectively, the data 
      suggest that the tandem repeat region of P47 and P67 influences disease outcome.

TI  - Increased frequency of long androgen receptor CAG repeats in male breast cancers.
PG  - 239-46
AB  - We have investigated the possible link between androgen hyposensitivity caused by 
      long androgen receptor (AR) CAG repeats, and breast carcinogenesis, in men. AR 
      gene mutations have been described in men with androgen insensitivity syndrome 
      and breast carcinoma, and some studies have shown long CAG repeats are associated 
      with increased risk of breast cancer in women. DNA was isolated from male breast 
      cancer biopsies, and the AR CAG repeat sized. Forty one male breast cancer 
      samples were studied, including one sample from a man with spinal and bulbar 
      muscular atrophy (SBMA), which is caused by an AR CAG repeat expansion. The man 
      with breast cancer and SBMA had 49 CAG repeats (normal range 6-35), but all other 
      breast cancer samples had repeats within the normal range. The frequency of CAG 
      repeats > or =24 was significantly higher in the breast cancer group (excluding 
      the SBMA subject) than in the normal population (p<0.05), and was more marked in 
      grade I and II tumors (p=0.001). There was no correlation between AR CAG repeat 
      length and age at diagnosis. In conclusion, longer AR CAG repeats are more common 
      in men with breast cancer than in the control male population. Androgen 
      hyposensitivity, caused by long AR CAG repeats, may increase the risk of breast 
      cancer in men.

TI  - Feasibility of a cost-effective approach to evaluate short tandem repeat markers 
      suitable for chimerism follow-up.
PG  - 87-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Precise chimerism monitoring is important for the prediction of the 
      success of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Most of the current 
      procedures employed for chimerism follow-up with short tandem repeat (STR) 
      markers are either time-consuming, labor-intensive, or use expensive assays, 
      making it burdensome to perform large-scale studies of transplanted patients. 
      AIM: To set-up a simple nonradioactive method to investigate a set of STR markers 
      that could be used in the evaluation of chimerism status after allogeneic BMT. 
      METHOD: Six dinucleotide STRs (D2S123, D5S107, CRTL1, D7S500, D11S1356, and TP53) 
      were analyzed by touchdown (TD)-PCR followed by medium size non-denaturing 
      polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining. The sensitivity of the 
      approach was evaluated by dilution competition assays. Peripheral blood samples 
      were taken from a group of 50 healthy Argentinean donors, two transplanted 
      patients, and their respective bone marrow donors. Buccal mucosa samples were 
      also obtained from the BMT recipients. RESULTS: Four markers, D2S123, D7S500, 
      D11S1356, and TP53, presented the highest heterozygosities (0.67-0.88) under our 
      experimental system. A sensitivity of 0.8-1.6% for chimerism detection was 
      consistently found for the different STR. The usefulness of these STR in 
      chimerism analysis was illustrated with the screening of related siblings 
      analyzing two transplanted patients with persistent mixed chimerism, which were 
      previously studied by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Similar 
      proportions of mixed chimerism were obtained with STR analysis compared with 
      those estimated by FISH. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this was the first study 
      of mixed chimerism using TD-PCR to achieve a highly specific STR amplification. 
      This approach allows simple and accurate chimerism quantification because it 
      avoids slippage of Taq polymerase on repeat stretches and prevents the 
      differential amplification of the shorter allele. STR heterozygosities and the 
      high level of sensitivity of this method demonstrated that this approach is not 
      only very informative in this population, but is also rapid (taking less than 14 
      hours) and cost-efficient. CONCLUSION: The data confirms that this method is a 
      useful tool applicable to routine large-scale STR genotyping and mixed chimerism 
      analysis in low-complexity laboratories worldwide.

TI  - Distribution of a single nucleotide polymorphism on codon 211 of the androgen 
      receptor gene and its correlation with human renal cell cancer in Japanese 
      patients.
PG  - 468-71
AB  - The human androgen receptor (AR) gene contains a single nucleotide polymorphism 
      (SNP) on codon 211 and two polymorphic short tandem repeats of CAG and GGC in the 
      N-terminal domain that may influence transcription efficiency of AR gene. We 
      previously reported that the lengths of the CAG and GGC repeats are inversely and 
      linearly related to AR activity and associated with several cancers. However, 
      little is known about this SNP on codon 211 of the AR gene in human renal cell 
      cancer. The cause of renal cell cancer is not well understood although several 
      factors such as chemical carcinogens and hormones have been implicated. AR has 
      been identified in human and animal renal cell cancer. We hypothesize that the 
      SNP on codon 211 is associated with human renal cell cancer. To test this 
      hypothesis, the genetic distribution of the SNP on codon 211 of AR gene was 
      investigated in renal cell cancer patients (211 cases) and healthy controls (200 
      cases). The allelic and genotypic distributions were determined by PCR-RFLP and 
      direct DNA sequencing techniques. The chi2 test for these data revealed that the 
      distribution of this SNP was not different between renal cell cancer patients as 
      compared to normal healthy controls. The findings suggest that the SNP on codon 
      211 in the AR gene may not have an important role in the carcinogenesis of human 
      renal cell cancers.

TI  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme (insertion/deletion) and endothelial nitric oxide 
      synthase polymorphisms in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.
PG  - 1756-62
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Genetic polymorphisms in the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and 
      endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) are linked with expression and/or 
      progression of renal disease. We hypothesized that polymorphisms in the genes 
      coding for ACE and eNOS may influence the development and/or progression of 
      systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis given their linkage with 
      other renal diseases. METHODS: DNA from patients with SLE (n = 227) and their age 
      and sex matched controls (n = 275) from the Carolina Lupus (CLU) Study cohort was 
      assessed for ACE and eNOS polymorphisms. Seventy patients had biopsy-proven lupus 
      nephritis. Two different eNOS polymorphisms (eNOS promoter T-786(R)C nucleotide 
      substitution and eNOS 27 base pair tandem repeat in intron 4) and the ACE 
      insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism in intron 16 were examined by restriction 
      fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Allele frequency 
      of the eNOS polymorphisms varied significantly between SLE patients and controls. 
      There was no association of these polymorphisms with lupus within ethnic groups. 
      We found no association of the polymorphism with the development of renal 
      disease. No association was observed for the ACE I/D polymorphism with SLE or 
      nephritis, or with ethnicity or sex. CONCLUSION: eNOS genetic polymorphisms 
      differed significantly across ethnic groups. There was no significant increased 
      risk of SLE and/or lupus nephritis associated with eNOS or ACE polymorphisms in 
      either the African American or Caucasian groups compared to ethnically matched 
      controls. These studies emphasize the need to control for ethnicity when 
      investigating genetic polymorphisms and disease.

TI  - The androgen receptor gene mutations database (ARDB): 2004 update.
PG  - 527-33
AB  - The current version of the androgen receptor (AR) gene mutations database is 
      described. The total number of reported mutations has risen from 374 to 605, and 
      the number of AR-interacting proteins described has increased from 23 to 70, both 
      over the past 3 years. A 3D model of the AR ligand-binding domain (AR LBD) has 
      been added to give a better understanding of gene structure-function 
      relationships. In addition, silent mutations have now been reported in both 
      androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) and prostate cancer (CaP) cases. The 
      database also now incorporates information on the exon 1 CAG repeat expansion 
      disease, spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), as well as CAG repeat length 
      variations associated with risk for female breast, uterine endometrial, 
      colorectal, and prostate cancer, as well as for male infertility. The possible 
      implications of somatic mutations, as opposed to germline mutations, in the 
      development of future locus-specific mutation databases (LSDBs) is discussed. The 
      database is available on the Internet (http://www.mcgill.ca/androgendb/).

TI  - Insulin receptor splicing alteration in myotonic dystrophy type 2.
PG  - 1309-13
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is caused by either an untranslated CTG expansion in the 
      3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene on chromosome 19 (dystrophia myotonica 
      type 1 [DM1]), or an untranslated CCTG tetranucleotide repeat expansion in intron 
      1 of the ZNF9 gene on chromosome 3 (dystrophia myotonica type 2 [DM2]). 
      RNA-binding proteins adhere to transcripts of the repeat expansions that 
      accumulate in the nucleus, and a trans-dominant dysregulation of pre-mRNA 
      alternative splicing has been demonstrated for several genes. In muscle from 
      patients with DM1, altered insulin-receptor splicing to the nonmuscle isoform 
      corresponds to the insulin insensitivity and diabetes that are part of the DM 
      phenotype; because of insulin-receptor species differences, this effect is not 
      seen in mouse models of the disease. We now demonstrate that comparable splicing 
      abnormalities occur in DM2 muscle prior to the development of muscle 
      histopathology, thus demonstrating an early pathogenic effect of RNA expansions.

TI  - New methods for molecular diagnosis and demonstration of the (CCTG)n mutation in 
      myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2).
PG  - 274-83
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2 are autosomal dominant, multisystemic disorders 
      with many similarities in their clinical manifestations. Myotonic dystrophy type 
      1 is caused by a (CTG)n expansion in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene 
      in 19q13.3 and myotonic dystrophy type 2 by a (CCTG)n expansion in intron 1 of 
      ZNF9 in 3q21.3. However, the clinical diagnosis of myotonic dystrophy type 2 is 
      more complex than that of myotonic dystrophy type 1, and conventional molecular 
      genetic methods used for diagnosing myotonic dystrophy type 1 are insufficient 
      for myotonic dystrophy type 2. Herein we describe two in situ hybridization 
      protocols for the myotonic dystrophy type 2 mutation detection. Chromogenic in 
      situ hybridization was used to detect both the genomic expansion and the mutant 
      transcripts in muscle biopsy sections. Chromogenic in situ hybridization can be 
      used in routine myotonic dystrophy type 2 diagnostics. Fluorescence in situ 
      hybridization on extended DNA fibers was used to directly visualize the myotonic 
      dystrophy type 2 mutation and to estimate the repeat expansion sizes.

TI  - Androgen receptor YAC transgenic mice recapitulate SBMA motor neuronopathy and 
      implicate VEGF164 in the motor neuron degeneration.
PG  - 687-99
AB  - X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an inherited neuromuscular 
      disorder characterized by lower motor neuron degeneration. SBMA is caused by 
      polyglutamine repeat expansions in the androgen receptor (AR). To determine the 
      basis of AR polyglutamine neurotoxicity, we introduced human AR yeast artificial 
      chromosomes carrying either 20 or 100 CAGs into mouse embryonic stem cells. The 
      AR100 transgenic mice developed a late-onset, gradually progressive neuromuscular 
      phenotype accompanied by motor neuron degeneration, indicating striking 
      recapitulation of the human disease. We then tested the hypothesis that 
      polyglutamine-expanded AR interferes with CREB binding protein (CBP)-mediated 
      transcription of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and observed altered 
      CBP-AR binding and VEGF reduction in AR100 mice. We found that mutant AR-induced 
      death of motor neuron-like cells could be rescued by VEGF. Our results suggest 
      that SBMA motor neuronopathy involves altered expression of VEGF, consistent with 
      a role for VEGF as a neurotrophic/survival factor in motor neuron disease.

TI  - Androgen receptor CAG repeat lengths in ductal carcinoma in situ of breast, 
      longest in apocrine variety.
PG  - 23-7
AB  - CAG repeat number in the androgen receptor (AR) has been associated with 
      decreased prostate cancer risk, and AR expression has been found in female breast 
      cancer, often associated with apocrine differentiation. Because trinucleotide 
      expansion can alter gene expression and protein function, we hypothesized that it 
      might occur in breast neoplasms. We used a repeat expansion detection technique 
      to determine CAG repeat lengths in DNA from breast biopsies. Three lesion types 
      were microdissected: fibroadenoma (48 cases), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS, 24 
      cases), and invasive mammary carcinoma (18 cases). The maximum number of CAG 
      repeats in either allele of each patient in these three groups was compared. 
      Microsatellite repeat lengths in DCIS were longer than in fibroadenomas or 
      invasive carcinomas (P= 0.017 comparing DCIS vs invasive carcinomas). Two cases 
      of apocrine DCIS had very long repeat lengths, both exhibiting microsatellite 
      lengths at the longest range of normal (32 and 33). Inherited differences in AR 
      CAG length might influence the transition from DCIS to invasive breast cancer, 
      perhaps by modulating function of AR in breast tissue. AR microsatellite 
      polymorphisms could influence cellular differentiation in DCIS lesions, promoting 
      formation of the apocrine subtype in the presence of longer CAG repeats.

TI  - Ribonuclear inclusions in skeletal muscle in myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2.
PG  - 760-8
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) and type 2 (DM2) are caused by genomic expansions 
      of CTG or CCTG repeats. When transcribed, these mutations give rise to repeat 
      expansion RNAs that form nuclear inclusions and compromise the function of 
      myonuclei. Here, we have used in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence to 
      compare DM1 and DM2 and search for proteins that associate with the RNA nuclear 
      (ribonuclear) inclusions. Although muscle disease is generally more severe in 
      DM1, the ribonuclear inclusions were 8- to 13-fold more intense in DM2, implying 
      greater amounts of repeat expansion RNA. Expression of repeat expansion RNA in 
      myoblasts has been implicated in the pathogenesis of congenital DM1. However, we 
      found that repeat expansion RNA is also expressed in myoblasts in DM2, a disorder 
      that has not been associated with a congenital phenotype. Of 10 putative CUG 
      binding proteins tested for colocalization with mutant RNA, only proteins in the 
      muscleblind family were recruited into ribonuclear inclusions. Previous studies 
      have shown activation of the protein kinase, PKR, by expanded CUG repeats in 
      vitro. However, breeding experiments utilizing PKR knockout mice indicate that 
      this kinase is not required for disease pathogenesis in a transgenic mouse model 
      of DM1. We conclude that ribonuclear inclusions are a key feature of the muscle 
      pathology in DM and that sequestration of muscleblind proteins may have a direct 
      role in the disease process.

TI  - Corticotroph carcinoma presenting as a silent corticotroph adenoma.
PG  - 41-7
AB  - Malignant pituitary tumours are rare and their pathogenesis is not fully 
      understood. We have performed genetic analyses on tissues arising from a 
      pituitary carcinoma that initially presented as a silent corticotroph adenoma but 
      which failed to respond to repeated, aggressive surgical and medical therapy. 
      Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of known or putative tumour suppressor genes (TSG) 
      was assessed by microsatellite analysis of microdissected tumour and matched 
      patient blood DNA. Clonality of the pituitary tumour samples was analysed by two 
      PCR-based techniques; one employing the highly polymorphic short tandem repeat 
      (STR) within the human androgen receptor allele (HUMARA), another based on a 
      restriction fragment length polymorphism of the X chromosome phosphoglycerokinase 
      (PGK-1) gene. Screening with 9 microsatellite markers demonstrated allelic loss 
      at 3 sites (D1S190, D3S1283 and D10S297) in all tumour samples except the 
      presenting pituitary tumour. X chromosome inactivation analysis demonstrated 
      polyclonality in the original presenting tumour and a metastatic deposit but 
      monoclonality in tissue samples from a second and third transsphenoidal 
      resection. In these cases of tumour recurrence both LOH and X chromosome 
      inactivation suggest that monoclonality arose from preferential clonal growth 
      from the original polyclonal tumour. Polyclonality of the metastatic deposit 
      suggests that this was derived from the presenting tumour, although the LOH 
      pattern indicates that a single clone dominates. The data are consistent with 
      increasing allelic loss associated with tumour dedifferentiation and malignant 
      transformation.

TI  - A muscleblind knockout model for myotonic dystrophy.
PG  - 1978-80
AB  - The neuromuscular disease myotonic dystrophy (DM) is caused by microsatellite 
      repeat expansions at two different genomic loci. Mutant DM transcripts are 
      retained in the nucleus together with the muscleblind (Mbnl) proteins, and these 
      abnormal RNAs somehow interfere with pre-mRNA splicing regulation. Here, we show 
      that disruption of the mouse Mbnl1 gene leads to muscle, eye, and RNA splicing 
      abnormalities that are characteristic of DM disease. Our results support the 
      hypothesis that manifestations of DM can result from sequestration of specific 
      RNA binding proteins by a repetitive element expansion in a mutant RNA.

TI  - Identification of a mutant allele of the androgen receptor gene in a family with

PG  - 25-9
AB  - We report the results of a molecular study of a large family segregating the 
      complete form of the Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS) in several members 
      from three generations. We identified the mutant allele by Polymerase Chain 
      Reaction (PCR) amplification of the short tandem repeat (CAG)n, highly 
      polymorphic in the population, present in the first exon of the androgen receptor 
      (AR) gene. In this family four different alleles were detected and one of these 
      showed a perfect segregation with the disease. This study enabled us to identify 
      the heterozygous females in this family. We think that this simple, indirect 
      test, is also suitable for prenatal diagnosis of Morris' syndrome when the mother 
      is heterozygous for the size of the short tandem repeat and one affected subject 
      in the family may be studied.

TI  - A genome-wide scan for autoimmune thyroiditis in the Old Order Amish: replication 
      of genetic linkage on chromosome 5q11.2-q14.3.
PG  - 1292-6
AB  - Autoimmune thyroiditis (AITD) is a common disorder characterized by circulating 
      antibodies to epitopes of thyroid tissue and hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's 
      thyroiditis or AITD-hypothyroidism), although many subjects with AITD are 
      euthyroid. Current evidence suggests that AITD is familial and polygenic. We 
      studied AITD in a homogeneous founder Caucasian population, the Old Order Amish 
      of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. We found autoimmune thyroiditis, defined by 
      the presence of circulating antimicrosomal antibodies, to be relatively common in 
      the Amish, with a prevalence of 22.7%. The prevalence of AITD-hypothyroidism was 
      9.2%. We performed a genome-wide linkage analysis with 373 short tandem repeat 
      markers in 445 subjects from 29 families. We observed suggestive evidence of 
      linkage of AITD to a locus on chromosome 5q11.2-q14.3 (LOD, 2.30; P = 0.0006 at 
      94 cM; closest marker, D5S428), a region that was previously reported to be 
      linked to AITD-hypothyroidism in a Japanese study. AITD-hypothyroidism showed a 
      more modest linkage peak to the same region (LOD, 1.46; P = 0.005). Possible 
      linkage (nominal P < 0.01) to autoimmune thyroiditis and/or AITD-hypothyroidism 
      was also detected in five other regions. We conclude that a gene on chromosome 
      5q11.2-q14.3 is likely to contribute to susceptibility to AITD in the Amish.

TI  - Mutant DMPK 3'-UTR transcripts disrupt C2C12 myogenic differentiation by 
      compromising MyoD.
PG  - 419-29
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is caused by two similar noncoding repeat expansion 
      mutations (DM1 and DM2). It is thought that both mutations produce pathogenic RNA 
      molecules that accumulate in nuclear foci. The DM1 mutation is a CTG expansion in 
      the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of dystrophia myotonica protein kinase 
      (DMPK). In a cell culture model, mutant transcripts containing a (CUG)200 DMPK 
      3'-UTR disrupt C2C12 myoblast differentiation; a phenotype similar to what is 
      observed in myoblast cultures derived from DM1 patient muscle. Here, we have used 
      our cell culture model to investigate how the mutant 3'-UTR RNA disrupts 
      differentiation. We show that MyoD protein levels are compromised in cells that 
      express mutant DMPK 3'-UTR transcripts. MyoD, a transcription factor required for 
      the differentiation of myoblasts during muscle regeneration, activates 
      differentiation-specific genes by binding E-boxes. MyoD levels are significantly 
      reduced in myoblasts expressing the mutant 3'-UTR RNA within the first 6 h under 
      differentiation conditions. This reduction correlates with blunted E-box-mediated 
      gene expression at time points that are critical for initiating differentiation. 
      Importantly, restoring MyoD levels rescues the differentiation defect. We 
      conclude that mutant DMPK 3'-UTR transcripts disrupt myoblast differentiation by 
      reducing MyoD levels below a threshold required to activate the differentiation 
      program.

TI  - Ligand promotes intranuclear inclusions in a novel cell model of spinal and 
      bulbar muscular atrophy.
PG  - 50855-9
AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA, Kennedy's disease) is one of a group of 
      progressive neurodegenerative diseases resulting from a polyglutamine repeat 
      expansion. In SBMA the polymorphic trinucleotide CAG repeat in exon 1 of the 
      androgen receptor (AR) gene is increased, resulting in expansion of a 
      polyglutamine tract. Patient autopsy material reveals neuronal intranuclear 
      inclusions (NII) in affected regions that contain only amino-terminal epitopes of 
      the AR. Cell models have previously been unable to produce intranuclear 
      inclusions containing only a portion of the AR. We report here the creation of an 
      inducible cell model of SBMA that reproduces this important characteristic of 
      disease pathology. PC12 cells expressing highly expanded AR form ubiquitinated 
      intranuclear inclusions containing amino-terminal epitopes of the AR as well as 
      heat shock proteins. Inclusions appear as distinct granular electron-dense 
      structures in the nucleus by immunoelectron microscopy. Dihydrotestosterone 
      treatment of mutant AR-expressing cells results in increased inclusion load. This 
      model mimics the formation of ubiquitinated intranuclear inclusions containing 
      the amino-terminal portion of AR observed in patient tissue and reveals a role 
      for ligand in the pathogenesis of SBMA.

TI  - A mouse model of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.
PG  - 2103-11
AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an adult-onset motor neuron disease, 
      caused by the expansion of a trinucleotide repeat (TNR) in exon 1 of the androgen 
      receptor (AR) gene. This disorder is characterized by degeneration of motor and 
      sensory neurons, proximal muscular atrophy, and endocrine abnormalities, such as 
      gynecomastia and reduced fertility. We describe the development of a transgenic 
      model of SBMA expressing a full-length human AR (hAR) cDNA carrying 65 (AR(65)) 
      or 120 CAG repeats (AR(120)), with widespread expression driven by the 
      cytomegalovirus promoter. Mice carrying the AR(120) transgene displayed 
      behavioral and motor dysfunction, while mice carrying 65 CAG repeats showed a 
      mild phenotype. Progressive muscle weakness and atrophy was observed in AR(120) 
      mice and was associated with the loss of alpha-motor neurons in the spinal cord. 
      There was no evidence of neurodegeneration in other brain structures. Motor 
      dysfunction was observed in both male and female animals, showing that in SBMA 
      the polyglutamine repeat expansion causes a dominant gain-of-function mutation in 
      the AR. The male mice displayed a progressive reduction in sperm production 
      consistent with testis defects reported in human patients. These mice represent 
      the first model to reproduce the key features of SBMA, making them a useful 
      resource for characterizing disease progression, and for testing therapeutic 
      strategies for both polyglutamine and motor neuron diseases.

TI  - Molecular chaperones enhance the degradation of expanded polyglutamine repeat 
      androgen receptor in a cellular model of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.
PG  - 515-23
AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is one of a growing number of 
      neurodegenerative diseases caused by a polyglutamine-encoding CAG trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion, and is caused by an expansion within exon 1 of the androgen 
      receptor (AR) gene. The family of polyglutamine diseases is characterized by the 
      presence of ubiquitinated, intranuclear inclusions associated with molecular 
      chaperones and 26S proteasome components, although the role of these inclusions 
      in the pathogenesis of polyglutamine diseases remains unclear. The 
      over-expression of molecular chaperones of the Hsp70 and Hsp40 families has been 
      shown to modulate inclusion frequency and cellular toxicity. We developed a cell 
      culture system which enables the quantitative analysis of the effects of 
      molecular chaperones on the biochemical properties of an expanded repeat AR. 
      Using this approach, we demonstrate that Hsp70 and its co-chaperone Hsp40 not 
      only increase expanded repeat AR solubility, but function to enhance the 
      degradation of expanded repeat AR through the proteasome. Furthermore, our 
      studies indicate that these molecular chaperones significantly decrease the 
      half-life of an expanded repeat AR. Molecular chaperone enhancement of protein 
      degradation points to the modulation of molecular chaperones as a potential 
      therapeutic target for polyglutamine diseases.

TI  - Comparison of short tandem repeat and variable number tandem repeat genetic 
      markers for quantitative determination of allogeneic bone marrow transplant 
      engraftment.
PG  - 243-8
AB  - Variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) were among the first genetic markers used 
      to quantitate bone marrow transplant engraftment. The limitations of PCR-based 
      VNTR markers in distinguishing some donor/recipient pairs has shown the need for 
      additional genetic markers to analyze engraftment. Short tandem repeats (STRs) 
      provide an excellent tool for this purpose because of their high degree of 
      polymorphism and relatively short length. We compared STR analysis results with 
      previous VNTR results for 16 post-transplantation samples from four allogeneic 
      bone marrow transplant patients. Previously analyzed patient samples were chosen 
      to cover the full range of engraftment. DNA samples from each patient were 
      analyzed in a blinded fashion. Good quantitative correlation was found between 
      STR and VNTR results in samples from all four patients. STR markers were 
      informative in one patient for whom PCR-based VNTR markers were not available. 
      Correlation of VNTR and STR methods helps to validate the use of STRs for the 
      quantitative analysis of bone marrow transplant engraftment. This study 
      demonstrates that STR-based human identity testing kits are well suited for 
      engraftment analysis.

TI  - Detection of fetal cells in intrauterine lavage samples collected in the first 
      trimester of pregnancy.
PG  - 52-5
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was first to evaluate the presence of 
      fetal cells in transcervical cell (TCC) samples collected by intrauterine lavage 
      in the first trimester of pregnancy, and then to compare different methods for 
      the detection of these cells. METHODS: TCC samples were collected by intrauterine 
      lavage before termination of pregnancy (TOP) from 81 pregnant women between 7 and 
      12 weeks of gestation. Samples of placental tissue were collected from each 
      patient at TOP, whereas maternal peripheral blood samples were obtained in 57 
      cases. DNA extracted from 81 lavage and the corresponding placental samples was 
      amplified by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay using primers for SRY and 
      HUMARA genes. All 81 lavage samples were also analysed by fluorescent in situ 
      hybridisation (FISH) using direct-labelled probes for X chromosome 
      alpha-satellite (DXZ1, Xp11.1-q11.1) and Y chromosome alpha-satellite (DYZ3, 
      Yp11.1-q11.1) regions. In 57 cases, a quantitative fluorescent (QF) PCR assay, 
      involving the use of two small tandem repeat (STR) markers (D21S11, D21S14.11) 
      specific to chromosome 21 was employed to analyse DNA extracted from placental 
      tissue, lavage and maternal blood samples. RESULTS: PCR analysis revealed that 
      40/81 placental samples were from male pregnancies. Correct sexing was achieved 
      with the PCR technique in 30/40 (75%) lavage samples retrieved from pregnant 
      women with male conceptuses and in all 41 (100%) samples collected from 
      pregnancies with female fetuses. With the FISH analysis, nuclei bearing X and Y 
      signals were observed in 32/40 cases (80%) from known male pregnancies, the rate 
      of fetal cells ranging between 2% and 95%, whereas nuclei showing X and Y signals 
      were not detected in any of the 41 lavage samples from known female pregnancies. 
      Paternal peaks were present in 30/57 (52.6%) lavage samples tested by QF-PCR. 
      CONCLUSION: The results suggest that fetal cells can be found, at a significant 
      rate, in a very high proportion of intrauterine lavage samples. Therefore, this 
      sampling technique can be regarded as a promising tool towards minimally invasive 
      prenatal diagnosis. The FISH and PCR methods showed a similar efficiency in 
      detecting fetal cells.

TI  - Muscleblind localizes to nuclear foci of aberrant RNA in myotonic dystrophy types 
      1 and 2.
PG  - 2165-70
AB  - The phenotypes in myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2 (DM1 and DM2) are similar, 
      suggesting a shared pathophysiologic mechanism. DM1 is caused by expansion of a 
      CTG repeat in the DMPK gene. Pathogenic effects of this mutation are likely to be 
      mediated, at least in part, by the expanded CUG repeat in mutant mRNA. The mutant 
      transcripts are retained in the nucleus in multiple discrete foci. We 
      investigated the possibility that DM2 is also caused by expansion of a CTG repeat 
      or related sequence. Analysis of DNA by repeat expansion detection methods, and 
      RNA by ribonuclease protection, did not show an expanded CTG or CUG repeat in 
      DM2. However, hybridization of muscle sections with fluorescence-labeled 
      CAG-repeat oligonucleotides showed nuclear foci in DM2 similar to those seen in 
      DM1. Nuclear foci were present in all patients with symptomatic DM1 (n = 9) or 
      DM2 (n = 9) but not in any disease controls or healthy subjects (n = 23). The 
      foci were not seen with CUG- or GUC-repeat probes. Foci in DM2 were distinguished 
      from DM1 by lower stability of the probe-target duplex, suggesting that a 
      sequence related to the DM1 CUG expansion accumulates in the DM2 nucleus. 
      Muscleblind proteins, which interact with expanded CUG repeats in vitro, 
      localized to the nuclear foci in both DM1 and DM2. These results support the idea 
      that nuclear accumulation of mutant RNA is pathogenic in DM1, suggest that a 
      similar disease process occurs in DM2, and point to a role for muscleblind in the 
      pathogenesis of both disorders.

TI  - Prostate carcinoma risk and allelic variants of genes involved in androgen 
      biosynthesis and metabolism pathways.
PG  - 1130-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ethnicity, when it is used to mean shared genetic inheritance within 
      a group, has become one of the most important factors in determining prostate 
      carcinoma risk. Genetic polymorphisms were hypothesized to be the probable 
      explanation for differences in risk among ethnic groups. The authors evaluated 
      the association between polymorphisms in genes involved in the androgen 
      biosynthesis and metabolism pathway and the risk of prostate carcinoma. METHODS: 
      Two hundred twenty-six patients with the pathologic diagnosis of sporadic 
      prostate tumor and 156 healthy matched (age, ethnic group) male controls from a 
      large epidemiologic cohort were genotyped for previously described polymorphisms 
      in the androgen receptor (AR), 5alpha-reductase type II (SRD5A2), p450c17 
      (CYP17), and aromatase (CYP19) genes. The different polymorphisms in prostate 
      carcinoma patients also were analyzed according to age of onset, preoperative 
      prostate-specific antigen level, tumor stage, and tumor grade. RESULTS: The 
      distribution of the tetranucleotide simple tandem repeat polymorphism (STRP) in 
      intron 4 of CYP19 was significantly different in control and cancer patients (P = 
      0.012). The 171 allele and the 187 allele were associated with prostate carcinoma 
      risk (P = 0.05 and P = 0.045, respectively). Conversely, no association was 
      observed between prostate carcinoma risk and the other polymorphisms studied as 
      follow: the CAG repeat in exon 1 of AR, the (TA)n dinucleotide repeat 
      polymorphism in the 3' untranslated region, and the A49T or V89L substitutions in 
      SDR5A2, the single base pair (bp) (a T to C transition) polymorphism that creates 
      an additional Sp1-type (CCACC box) promoter site in CYP17. In prostate carcinoma 
      patients, CAG repeats of AR, and TA repeats of SDR5A2 are associated with age of 
      onset (P = 0.05 and P < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The association 
      between the 171-bp allele of CYP19 and prostate carcinoma risk suggests that 
      aromatase could be used as a new indicator for prostate carcinoma prevention in 
      men of White French ethnogeographic origin. Conversely, it is possible that an 
      individual carries both a high- and a low-risk marker (e.g., CYP17 A2 allele and 
      V89L in SRD5A2) resulting in no overall difference in risk observed across the 
      population. For these reasons, the development of a polygenic model, 
      incorporating multiple loci from the individual genes may maximize the chance of 
      identifying individuals with high-risk genotypes.

TI  - The myotonic dystrophy expanded CUG repeat tract is necessary but not sufficient 
      to disrupt C2C12 myoblast differentiation.
PG  - 1879-87
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a dominant neuromuscular disorder caused by a 
      trinucleotide (CTG) repeat expansion. Mutant DMPK 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) 
      transcripts aggregate in nuclear foci and are thought to impose dominant-negative 
      effects by interacting with RNA binding proteins. We demonstrated previously that 
      the mutant 3'-UTR RNA disrupted C2C12 myoblast differentiation, and that the CUG 
      expansion was necessary for this effect. Several proteins are known to interact 
      with the CUG tract or the region 3' (distal) to it. Here, using a library of 
      transfected C2C12 clones, we show that although transcripts containing a CUG 
      expansion alone or a CUG expansion plus the distal region of the DMPK 3'-UTR 
      accumulate into RNA foci, neither of these RNAs affect C2C12 myogenesis. Thus, 
      RNA foci formation, and perturbation of any RNA binding factors involved in this 
      process, are not sufficient to block myoblast differentiation. Interestingly, we 
      found that transcripts containing expanded CUG tracts can form both nuclear and 
      cytoplasmic RNA foci, demonstrating that factors involved in foci formation are 
      present in the nucleus and cytoplasm. RNA analysis of myogenic markers revealed 
      that the mutant DMPK 3'-UTR mRNA does not affect myoblast determination factors 
      MyoD or Myf5, but significantly impedes upregulation of the differentiation 
      factors myogenin and p21. C2C12 provide a good model to study adult muscle 
      regeneration. Our observations in this system may be relevant to the lack of a 
      regenerative response to continued muscle wasting in DM, and point to defects in 
      early events in the myogenic response to muscle damage.

TI  - Multiple founder effects in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA, Kennedy 
      disease) around the world.
PG  - 431-6
AB  - SBMA (spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy), also called Kennedy disease, is an 
      X-chromosomal recessive adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder caused by death of 
      the spinal and bulbar motor neurones and dorsal root ganglia. Patients may also 
      show signs of partial androgen insensitivity. SBMA is caused by a CAG repeat 
      expansion in the first exon of the androgen receptor (AR) gene on the 
      X-chromosome. Our previous study suggested that all the Nordic patients with SBMA 
      originated from an ancient Nordic founder mutation, but the new intragenic SNP 
      marker ARd12 revealed that the Danish patients derive their disease chromosome 
      from another ancestor. In search of relationships between patients from different 
      countries, we haplotyped altogether 123 SBMA families from different parts of the 
      world for two intragenic markers and 16 microsatellites spanning 25 cM around the 
      AR gene. The fact that different SBMA founder haplotypes were found in patients 
      from around the world implies that the CAG repeat expansion mutation has not been 
      a unique event. No expansion-prone haplotype could be detected. Trinucleotide 
      diseases often show correlation between the repeat length and the severity and 
      earlier onset of the disease. The longer the repeat, the more severe the symptoms 
      are and the onset of the disease is earlier. A negative correlation between the 
      CAG repeat length and the age of onset was found in the 95 SBMA patients with 
      defined ages at onset.

TI  - Larger trinucleotide repeat size in the androgen receptor gene of infertile men 
      with extremely severe oligozoospermia.
PG  - 444-8
AB  - Androgens are significant regulators of human spermatogenesis. Their action is 
      mediated through the androgen receptor (AR), which binds to the androgen 
      responsive element on DNA and regulates gene transcription. Men become infertile 
      with spinobulbar muscular atrophy (Kennedy disease) caused by a trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion, > or = 40 CAG repeats, in the AR gene located on the X 
      chromosome. In this prospective study, we investigated whether the variable size, 
      larger repeats, of this trinucleotide could alter AR function and result in 
      impaired spermatogenesis. A total of 69 infertile men were studied. Clinical and 
      laboratory analysis showed idiopathic, nonobstructive azoospermia in 16 men, 
      extremely severe oligozoospermia in 27 men (< 1 million sperm/mL), and severe 
      oligozoospermia in 26 men (1 to 5 million sperm/mL). Fertile control men (n = 45) 
      were selected by documented paternity proven by linkage analysis. Leukocyte DNA 
      was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification across the AR 
      repeat region. Accurate size determination of the PCR product using an ABI 373 
      DNA sequencer allowed precise calculation of CAG repeat sizes. The AR gene was 
      not analyzed for other types of mutations. The difference in CAG repeat size 
      between infertile men and proven fertile controls was statistically significant, 
      P = .03. Patients with extremely severe oligozoospermia had significantly longer 
      CAG repeat tracts (mean, 25.4 +/- 4.0; P = .0005; range 20-39) than controls 
      (mean, 22 +/- 2.8; range 12-30) or patients with severe oligozoospermia (mean, 
      22.2 +/- 2.3; range 18-26). None of the 26 infertile men with sperm counts < 1 
      million/mL had < or = 19 CAG repeats compared with 6 out of 45 controls (13%; P = 
      .06). This study suggests that some men with severe impairment of spermatogenesis 
      have longer trinucleotide repeats in the AR gene. Although direct evidence is 
      missing, lower affinity between androgen and the AR protein or decreased AR

TI  - Molecular determination of RhD phenotype by DNA typing: clinical applications.
PG  - 781-9
AB  - Rhesus D (RhD) typing is performed by agglutination methods; however, in clinical 
      situations where these techniques cannot be performed, RhD DNA typing is an 
      alternative approach. The Rh antigens are encoded by the RHD and RHCE genes. In 
      RhD-negative individuals the RHD gene is absent or grossly deleted, but 
      variations in the arrangement of the RH locus in different populations are 
      emerging. The aim of this study was to analyse the gross organization of the RH 
      genes in our population using a previously described multiplex polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR) method with some modifications. We studied 253 DNA samples from 
      Argentinian blood donors, 15 samples with a reduced expression of the D antigen 
      and 1 Dc- phenotype. We evaluated the clinical utility of this method to 
      ascertain the RhD antigen in 10 patients with warm-type autoimmune haemolytic 
      anaemia (AIHA) and 14 samples of amniotic fluids. All Rh phenotypes were properly 
      characterized and no discrepancies with serological typing were found. Analyses 
      performed in the Dc- phenotype suggest the presence of a hybrid RHCE-RHD gene. 
      DNA typing confirmed the RhD-negative type of one AIHA sample in which 
      serological tests were inconclusive. Foetal DNA typing correctly indicated the 
      RhD in every foetus. VNTR (variable number of tandem repeats) and STR (short 
      tandem repeats) analysis detected maternal contamination in two amniocentesis 
      samples and confirmed the foetal origin of 12. This multiplex PCR strategy is 
      suitable for RhD determination in clinical situations in which serological typing 
      cannot be accomplished with its usual ease.

TI  - Recruitment of human muscleblind proteins to (CUG)(n) expansions associated with 
      myotonic dystrophy.
PG  - 4439-48
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is an autosomal dominant neuromuscular disorder 
      associated with a (CTG)(n) expansion in the 3'-untranslated region of the DM1 
      protein kinase (DMPK) gene. To explain disease pathogenesis, the RNA dominance 
      model proposes that the DM1 mutation produces a gain-of-function at the RNA level 
      in which CUG repeats form RNA hairpins that sequester nuclear factors required 
      for proper muscle development and maintenance. Here, we identify the triplet 
      repeat expansion (EXP) RNA-binding proteins as candidate sequestered factors. As 
      predicted by the RNA dominance model, binding of the EXP proteins is specific for 
      dsCUG RNAs and proportional to the size of the triplet repeat expansion. 
      Remarkably, the EXP proteins are homologous to the Drosophila muscleblind 
      proteins required for terminal differentiation of muscle and photoreceptor cells. 
      EXP expression is also activated during mammalian myoblast differentiation, but 
      the EXP proteins accumulate in nuclear foci in DM1 cells. We propose that DM1 
      disease is caused by aberrant recruitment of the EXP proteins to the DMPK 
      transcript (CUG)(n) expansion.

TI  - CREB-binding protein sequestration by expanded polyglutamine.
PG  - 2197-202
AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is one of eight inherited 
      neurodegenerative diseases known to be caused by CAG repeat expansion. The 
      expansion results in an expanded polyglutamine tract, which likely confers a 
      novel, toxic function to the affected protein. Cell culture and transgenic mouse 
      studies have implicated the nucleus as a site for pathogenesis, suggesting that a 
      critical nuclear factor or process is disrupted by the polyglutamine expansion. 
      In this report we present evidence that CREB-binding protein (CBP), a 
      transcriptional co-activator that orchestrates nuclear response to a variety of 
      cell signaling cascades, is incorporated into nuclear inclusions formed by 
      polyglutamine-containing proteins in cultured cells, transgenic mice and tissue 
      from patients with SBMA. We also show CBP incorporation into nuclear inclusions 
      formed in a cell culture model of another polyglutamine disease, spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 3. We present evidence that soluble levels of CBP are reduced in 
      cells expressing expanded polyglutamine despite increased levels of CBP mRNA. 
      Finally, we demonstrate that over-expression of CBP rescues cells from 
      polyglutamine-mediated toxicity in neuronal cell culture. These data support a 
      CBP-sequestration model of polyglutamine expansion disease.

TI  - CAG trinucleotide repeats in the androgen receptor gene of infertile men exhibit 
      stable inheritance in female offspring conceived after ICSI.
PG  - 861-6
AB  - The androgen receptor (AR) gene is located on the X chromosome and contains a 
      polymorphic CAG tract. CAG repeat expansions in the AR have been associated with 
      male infertility and the neuromuscular disease, spinal bulbar muscular atrophy 
      (SBMA). Based on Mendelian inheritance patterns, moderate CAG expansions in 
      infertile men treated by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) would be 
      vertically transmitted to female offspring. Should further elongation of the 
      repeat region occur in the male germline, it is conceivable that longer 
      expansions could also be transmitted by ICSI and may lead to an increased 
      incidence of male infertility and SBMA in succeeding generations. To determine 
      the degree of stability of the paternal AR CAG tract following ICSI, we compared 
      the CAG repeat number in the AR alleles of 92 men presenting for ICSI and their 
      99 ICSI-conceived daughters. CAG repeat lengths in the AR alleles were determined 
      by fluorescent polymerase chain reaction and Genescan analysis of amplification 
      products separated on DNA sequencing gels. In the vast majority of cases (95 out 
      of 99), we found that the AR CAG tracts ranging in size from 15-28 repeats 
      exhibited stable inheritance in female offspring. However, in the remaining 
      father-daughter pairs, there was a discordance in the expected inheritance 
      pattern with evidence for both CAG expansion (20-->24; 22-->23) and contraction 
      (26-->18 or 22) of the paternal AR allele. The detection of a low frequency of 
      CAG mutation in paternal AR alleles following ICSI would be consistent with 
      gonadal mosaicism originating from meiotic DNA replication errors. These findings 
      in a typical group of infertile men undergoing ICSI for a variety of indications 
      tend to alleviate concerns that ICSI may promote the transmission of AR alleles 
      with expanded CAG tracts and suggest that the risk of SBMA in second generation 
      sons would be extremely low.

TI  - Molecular evidence that the stromal and epithelial cells in pleomorphic adenomas 
      of salivary gland arise from the same origin: clonal analysis using human 
      androgen receptor gene (HUMARA) assay.
PG  - 498-503
AB  - Salivary gland pleomorphic adenomas are characterized by a biphasic growth of 
      "epithelial" and "stromal" regions. The "epithelial" region is a compactly 
      organized mixture of both luminal and nonluminal cells, whereas the stromal 
      region is composed predominantly of the nonluminal cells. Using the polymerase 
      chain reaction (PCR)-based HUMARA assay on DNA from formalin-fixed, 
      paraffin-embedded tissues from pleomorphic adnomas of female patients, we intend 
      to clarify the clonal relation between the luminal and nonluminal cells and the 
      clonal nature of the morphologically diverse nonluminal cells in this tumor. 
      HUMARA, the human androgen receptor gene, is located on the X chromosome and 
      contains a segment of polymorphic CAG tandem repeats in exon 1. Several 
      methylation-sensitive HhaI restriction sites are located 5' to these CAG repeats. 
      It is an ideal tool to study clonality of female tissues by examining the 
      methylation pattern. Of the 13 cases analyzed, 3 were homozygous at the HUMARA 
      locus and therefore noninformative. The remaining 10 cases were informative. All 
      10 cases showed a monoclonal pattern in the stromal area, indicating that the 
      morphologically diverse nonluminal cells are monoclonal. Eight of the 10 cases 
      showed monoclonality in the "epithelial" areas, suggesting a common clonality 
      between luminal and nonluminal cells. Of the remaining 2 samples, 1 was 
      polyclonal for the "epithelial" region, and the other was not amplifiable. Our 
      data provide the first molecular evidence that the luminal and nonluminal cells 
      in pleomorphic adenomas arise from the same clone in most cases, and the 
      morphologically diverse nonluminal cells are monoclonal.

TI  - Mice deficient in Six5 develop cataracts: implications for myotonic dystrophy.
PG  - 105-9
AB  - Expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the 3' UTR of the gene DMPK at the DM1 
      locus on chromosome 19 causes myotonic dystrophy, a dominantly inherited disease 
      characterized by skeletal muscle dystrophy and myotonia, cataracts and cardiac 
      conduction defects. Targeted deletion of Dm15, the mouse orthologue of human 
      DMPK, produced mice with a mild myopathy and cardiac conduction abnormalities, 
      but without other features of myotonic dystrophy, such as myotonia and cataracts. 
      We, and others, have demonstrated that repeat expansion decreases expression of 
      the adjacent gene SIX5 (refs 7,8), which encodes a homeodomain transcription 
      factor. To determine whether SIX5 deficiency contributes to the myotonic 
      dystrophy phenotype, we disrupted mouse Six5 by replacing the first exon with a 
      beta-galactosidase reporter. Six5-mutant mice showed reporter expression in 
      multiple tissues, including the developing lens. Homozygous mutant mice had no 
      apparent abnormalities of skeletal muscle function, but developed lenticular 
      opacities at a higher rate than controls. Our results suggest that SIX5 
      deficiency contributes to the cataract phenotype in myotonic dystrophy, and that 
      myotonic dystrophy represents a multigenic disorder.

TI  - The mutation properties of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy disease alleles.
PG  - 249-52
AB  - We studied the gene for the trinucleotide repeat disorder X-linked spinal and 
      bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) to quantify the spectrum of mutations and gain 
      insight into genetic anticipation. This analysis was performed using single sperm 
      typing from an affected individual. This method allows the quantification of 
      large numbers of meioses and therefore provides accurate information about 
      genetic instability of the CAG repeat expansions which cause SBMA. Among 198 X 
      chromosome-containing sperm cells, 20% had a CAG repeat number equal to the 
      donor's somatic DNA of 49 CAG repeats, 56% were expansions, and 24% contractions. 
      Most of the expansions (84%) and contractions (94%) were between 1 and 3 CAG 
      repeats. These results are consistent with those obtained from one previously 
      studied SBMA patient and reveal greater CAG repeat instability in sperm than in 
      somatic tissue. Our results indicate that in SBMA, in contrast to sperm typing 
      analysis of Huntington's disease, there is relative stability of the CAG repeat 
      number during paternal transmissions and that the spectrum of mutations is 
      narrow. These results are in agreement with the limited available clinical data 
      and suggest that anticipation may not be a significant feature of this disease.

TI  - Desmoids in familial adenomatous polyposis are monoclonal proliferations.
PG  - 827-32
AB  - Desmoids are poorly-understood, locally aggressive, non-metastasizing 
      fibromatoses that occur with disproportionate frequency in patients with familial 
      adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Their nature is controversial with arguments for and 
      against a neoplastic origin. Neoplastic proliferations are by definition 
      monoclonal, whereas reactive processes originate from a polyclonal background. We 
      examined clonality of 25 samples of desmoid tissue from 11 female FAP patients by 
      assessing patterns of X-chromosome inactivation to calculate a clonality ratio. 
      Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of a polymorphic CAG short tandem 
      repeat (STR) sequence adjacent to a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme site 
      within the human androgen receptor (HUMARA) gene using fluorescent-labelled 
      primers enabled analysis of PCR products by Applied Biosystems Genescan II 
      software. Twenty-one samples from nine patients were informative for the assay. 
      Samples from all informative cases comprised a median of 66% (range 0-75%) clonal 
      cells but from the six patients with a clonality ratio < or =0.5 comprised a 
      median of 71% (65-75%) clonal cells. FAP-associated desmoid tumours are true 
      neoplasms. This may have implications in the development of improved treatment 
      protocols for patients with these aggressive tumours.

TI  - Clonality analysis by methylation-specific PCR for the human androgen-receptor 
      gene (HUMARA-MSP).
PG  - 207-12
AB  - The human androgen-receptor gene (HUMARA) has been used for analysis of X 
      chromosome inactivation (XCI) pattern because of a polymorphic short tandem 
      repeat (STR) near the 5'-promoter region correlated with XCI. We introduce a 
      novel method to analyze XCI pattern, named HUMARA methylation-specific PCR 
      (HUMARA-MSP) assay, which analyzes methylation status of the HUMARA gene by 
      bisulfite modification instead of a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme. 
      Although the original MSP method shows whether there is a methylated band or not, 
      our HUMARA-MSP method identifies the patterns of methylated and unmethylated 
      bands. Because this method identifies either unmethylated or methylated alleles 
      in each PCR tube and shows opposite band patterns dependent on methylation 
      status, we can assess the XCI pattern independently twice. This method can avoid 
      false results by incomplete enzyme digestion and incomplete bisulfite 
      modification will not affect the results. Extremely small quantities of samples, 
      such as hematopoietic colonies, were also available for HUMARA-MSP assay. Because 
      DNA modified by sodium bisulfite is also available for assessment of methylation 
      status of other genes by setting specific primers for them, we performed the 
      simultaneous assessment of clonality and aberrant hypermethylation of p15INK4B 
      gene in myelodysplastic syndromes. These simultaneous assessments were easily 
      possible and provided much information despite requiring only a small volume of 
      DNA. The HUMARA-MSP assay may facilitate the analyses for pathogenesis of 
      hematological disorders because of its simplicity, sensitivity and wide 
      applicability. Leukemia (2000) 14, 207-212.

TI  - Exclusion of AR-CHED from the chromosome 20 region containing the PPMD and 
      AD-CHED loci.
PG  - 243-9
AB  - Congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED) is a disorder of the corneal 
      endothelium and has been recognized to segregate in families with both autosomal 
      dominant (AD) and autosomal recessive (AR) modes of transmission. AD-CHED has 
      been previously linked to the pericentric region of chromosome 20. Posterior 
      polymorphous dystrophy (PPMD), a corneal endothelial disorder showing phenotypic 
      overlap with CHED, has also been previously genetically mapped to this region. 
      The genetic interval containing AD-CHED is within the larger genetic interval 
      containing the PPMD locus. This study sought to determine whether AR-CHED 
      segregating in a consanguineous Saudi Arabian pedigree is linked to the 
      previously mapped and overlapping loci for AD-CHED and PPMD on the pericentric 
      region of chromosome 20. Forty members of a consanguineous Saudi Arabian pedigree 
      segregating AR-CHED were ascertained. Short tandem-repeat polymorphic markers 
      from the 20 cM interval on chromosome 20 containing both the PPMD and AD-CHED 
      loci were used to genotype these individuals. LOD score analysis of the genotype 
      data with the MENDEL software package utilizing a model of autosomal recessive 
      inheritance with complete penetrance showed exclusion of CHED from the entire 
      PPMD/AD-CHED interval by utilizing overlapping intervals of LOD scores of at 
      least -2. The results obtained demonstrate that AR-CHED is not allelic to either 
      AD-CHED or PPMD, although it has been proposed that AD-CHED may be allelic to 
      PPMD. Thus, there are at least two genes responsible for CHED and PPMD.

TI  - The linkage of Kennedy's neuron disease to ARA24, the first identified androgen 
      receptor polyglutamine region-associated coactivator.
PG  - 20229-34
AB  - Although the linkage of polyglutamine (poly-Q) repeat expansion in the androgen 
      receptor (AR) to Kennedy's disease (X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy) 
      was a major step forward, the detailed molecular mechanism of how the change in 
      poly-Q length contributes to the disease remains unclear. Here we report the 
      identification of a nuclear G-protein, Ras-related nuclear protein/ARA24, as the 
      first AR coactivator that can bind differentially with different lengths of 
      poly-Q within AR. In the yeast and mammalian reciprocal interacting assays, our 
      data suggested the interaction of AR N-terminal domain with ARA24 diminishes as 
      the poly-Q length increases. The coactivation of ARA24 also diminishes with the 
      poly-Q expansion within AR. Deletion of the acidic hexapeptide (DEDDDL) at the C 
      terminus of ARA24 further enhances its AR coactivation. Together, our data 
      suggest that poor interaction and weaker coactivation of ARA24 to the longer 
      poly-Q AR in the X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophied AR could 
      contribute to the weaker transactivation of AR. The consequence of poor 
      interaction and weak coactivation may eventually lead to the partial androgen 
      insensitivity during the development of Kennedy's disease.

TI  - Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) locus lacks linkage to 
      human vitiligo or osteopetrosis: an evaluation.
PG  - 187-92
AB  - The microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) locus has been mapped 
      to human chromosome 3p12-p14.1, and encodes a basic helix-loop-helix zipper 
      (bHLH-ZIP) protein homologous to a number of transcription factors. Numerous 
      mutations at the mouse microphthalmia (mi) locus have been described, and all 
      have reduced or absent pigmentation of the eyes, ears, and/or pelage, with some 
      genotypes exhibiting small or absent eyes and osteopetrosis. The mivit/vit 
      mutation at the mouse mi locus produces a postnatal depigmentation that resembles 
      human vitiligo. The mice homozygous for this mi allele show a progressive loss of 
      cutaneous, hair and ocular pigmentation with age. Vitiligo, an acquired 
      depigmentary disorder, is characterized by patchy depigmentation of skin that 
      generally begins around puberty and tends to become more progressive over time. 
      There is suggestive evidence that human vitiligo may be inherited; however, the 
      mode of inheritance is still debated and the pathogenesis is not clearly 
      delineated. The human disorder osteopetrosis is characterized by a generalized 
      net accumulation of skeletal mass and results from reduced osteoclast function in 
      the bone. This is an inherited disorder and has been associated with mi in a 
      mutant mouse. Therefore, the possible involvement of the MITF locus in the 
      pathogenesis of either familial vitiligo or osteopetrosis was investigated. 
      Linkage analysis was performed using microsatellite polymorphic markers D3S2465, 
      D3S1261, and D3S1766 on genomic DNA from 26 families with vitiligo/osteopetrosis. 
      D3S1261 is physically located at or near the MITF locus, while D3S2465 and 
      D3S1766 are flanking the locus at about 17.5 cM genetic distance each side. 
      Evidence from LOD score analysis surprisingly indicated that none of the families 
      with vitiligo or osteopetrosis are linked to these short tandem repeat 
      polymorphisms (STRPs). Thus, the human homolog (MITF) of the mouse mi gene, a 
      good candidate gene at the phenotypic level, may not be involved in the 
      pathogenesis of familial human vitiligo or osteopetrosis.

TI  - Trinucleotide expansion mutations in the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein 
      (COMP) gene.
PG  - 123-8
AB  - Pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH) and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED) are two 
      human autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasias characterized by variable short 
      stature, joint laxity and early-onset degenerative joint disease. Both disorders 
      can result from mut-ations in the gene for cartilage oligomeric matrix protein 
      (COMP), an extracellular matrix glycoprotein. About one-third of PSACH cases 
      result from heterozygosity for deletion of one codon within a very short triplet 
      repeat, (GAC)5, which encodes five consecutive aspartic acid residues within the 
      calmodulin-like region of the COMP protein. We have identified two expansion 
      mut-ations in this repeat: an MED patient carrying a (GAC)6allele and a PSACH 
      patient carrying a (GAC)7allele. These are among the shortest disease-causing 
      triplet repeat expansion mutations described thus far, and are the first 
      identified in a GAC repeat. A unique feature of this sequence is that expansion 
      as well as shortening of the repeat can cause the same disease. In cartilage, 
      both patients have rough endoplasmic reticulum inclusions in chondrocytes. The 
      inclusions are also present in tendon tissue and can be reproduced in cultured 
      tendon cells, suggesting that the pathophysiology of disease is similar in both 
      cartilage and tendon.

TI  - Cardiac elav-type RNA-binding protein (ETR-3) binds to RNA CUG repeats expanded 
      in myotonic dystrophy.
PG  - 53-60
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is a neuromuscular disorder associated with CTG triplet 
      repeat expansion in the myotonin protein kinase gene ( DMPK ). We previously 
      proposed a hypothesis suggesting that the expanded CUG repeats sequester specific 
      RNA-binding proteins and that such a sequestration results in abnormal RNA 
      processing of several RNAs containing CUG repeats in multiple tissues affected in 
      patients with DM. One of the members of the CUG-binding proteins, CUG-BP, has 
      been identified previously. Here we describe the second member of this family, 
      elav -type ribonucleoprotein (ETR-3), which is highly expressed in heart and is 
      able to interact with CUG repeats. Screening of a mouse liver cDNA library with a 
      CUG-BP probe identified two mETR-3 cDNAs. Two additional cDNAs from mouse heart 
      were amplified by RT-PCR. These cDNAs differ by several insertions/deletions and 
      might be generated via alternative splicing. Mouse ETR-3 has a mol. wt of 50 kDa 
      and displays a high level of homology to CUG-BP protein. The organization of the 
      RNA-binding domains (RBDs) within the ETR-3 molecule is similar to one within 
      CUG-BP. A study of mETR-3 RNA-binding activity showed that the mETR-3 binds to 
      (CUG)8repeats. Sequence analysis of mETR-3 indicates the presence of several CUG 
      repeats within the mETR-3 mRNA. Both CUG-BP and mETR-3 bind to mETR-3 mRNA via 
      CUG repeats, suggesting the possible involvement of CUG-BP-like proteins in the 
      regulation of mETR-3 processing. Analysis of the tissue distribution of ETR-3 
      showed that in human cells, ETR-3 mRNA is highly expressed in heart, but is 
      undetectable in other tissues examined. Our results suggest the existence of a 
      family of proteins that bind to CUG repeats and might be affected in DM by 
      expansion of CUG repeats.

TI  - Kennedy's disease: caspase cleavage of the androgen receptor is a crucial event 
      in cytotoxicity.
PG  - 185-95
AB  - X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), Kennedy's disease, is a 
      degenerative disease of the motor neurons that is associated with an increase in 
      the number of CAG repeats encoding a polyglutamine stretch within the androgen 
      receptor (AR). Recent work has demonstrated that the gene products associated 
      with open reading frame triplet repeat expansions may be substrates for the 
      cysteine protease cell death executioners, the caspases. However, the role that 
      caspase cleavage plays in the cytotoxicity associated with expression of the 
      disease-associated alleles is unknown. Here, we report the first conclusive 
      evidence that caspase cleavage is a critical step in cytotoxicity; the expression 
      of the AR with an expanded polyglutamine stretch enhances its ability to induce 
      apoptosis when compared with the normal AR. The AR is cleaved by a caspase-3 
      subfamily protease at Asp146, and this cleavage is increased during apoptosis. 
      Cleavage of the AR at Asp146 is critical for the induction of apoptosis by AR, as 
      mutation of the cleavage site blocks the ability of the AR to induce cell death. 
      Further, mutation of the caspase cleavage site at Asp146 blocks the ability of 
      the SBMA AR to form perinuclear aggregates. These studies define a fundamental 
      role for caspase cleavage in the induction of neural cell death by proteins 
      displaying expanded polyglutamine tracts, and therefore suggest a strategy that 
      may be useful to treat neurodegenerative diseases associated with polyglutamine 
      repeat expansions.

TI  - X chromosome inactivation patterns in normal females.
PG  - 439-47
AB  - Since one of the two X chromosomes is randomly inactivated at an early stage of 
      female embryonic development, X-linked markers have been used to study the origin 
      and development of various neoplastic disorders in affected heterozygous women; 
      clonality assays have provided a useful tool to the understanding of the 
      mechanisms underlying the development of neoplasia. Recently, a technique of 
      clonal analysis has been devised that takes advantage of a highly polymorphic 
      short tandem repeat within the X-linked human androgen receptor (AR) gene, 
      resulting in a heterozygosity rate approaching 90%. The rapid expansion of the 
      number of women now suitable for X inactivation analysis has however given rise 
      to new controversies, one of the more troublesome being the possibility of a 
      modification of the pattern of X- chromosome inactivation pattern in blood cells 
      of elderly women. In the present study we analyze with the AR assay a group of 
      166 healthy females aged between 8 and 94 years, with no history of genetic or 
      neoplastic familial disorders. We failed to find any correlation between age and 
      X- chromosome inactivation pattern (r = 0.17), even subdividing the subjects in 
      different age groups according to the criteria used by other researchers, and 
      therefore reaffirm that, when tested for with well-standardized and accurate 
      criteria, extremely unbalanced inactivation of the X chromosome is a truly 
      uncommon phenomenon in normal women.

TI  - Evolution of the primate androgen receptor: a structural basis for disease.
PG  - 334-42
AB  - Androgen effects mediated by the androgen receptor (AR) are essential for male 
      reproductive development and virilization. Comparison of AR DNA coding sequence 
      from five primate species, Homo sapiens (human), Pan troglodytes (chimpanzee), 
      Papio hamadryas (baboon), Macaca fascicularis (macaque), and Eulemur fulvus 
      collaris (collared brown lemur), supports their phylogeny with complete 
      conservation of the DNA and steroid binding domain protein sequence. A linear 
      increase in trinucleotide repeat expansion of homologous CAG and GGC sequences 
      occurs in the NH2-terminal transcriptional activation region and is proportional 
      to the time of species divergence. A serine phosphate/glutamine repeat 
      interaction is observed where increasing CAG repeat length is associated with an 
      increased rate of serine 94 phosphorylation. Disparity in the calculated and 
      apparent molecular weight with CAG repeat expansion of an AR NH2-terminal 
      fragment suggests self-aggregation with increasing glutamine repeat length into 
      the pathological range. These results suggest that a CAG/glutamine repeat 
      expanded during divergence of the higher primate species, which may have a direct 
      effect on AR structure and support a common pathway in CAG trigenic diseases in 
      the pathophysiology of neurodegeneration observed in X-linked spinal bulbar and 
      muscular atrophy.

TI  - Clonal analysis of hematopoietic cells using a novel polymorphic site of the X 
      chromosome.
PG  - 263-6
AB  - Clonality of hematopoietic cells on a smale scale (nanogram amounts of DNA) can 
      be detected by X-chromosome inactivation using the polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR). The human androgen-receptor gene (HUMARA) has a polymorphic short tandem 
      repeat (STR), and has generally been used for clonality analysis since 
      heterozygosity for the gene occurs in 90% of caucasian females. We examined 
      heterozygosity of the STR on HUMARA in 110 Japanese females and found 
      heterozygosity in 74 of 110 (67%). To examine for hematologic clonality in 
      females with HUMARA homozygosity, we used a primer specific for a novel 
      polymorphic STR site between DXS15 and DXS134 (DXS15-134) on Xq28. Heterozygosity 
      for this site was found in 50 of 110 females (46%). Clonality of the 
      hematopoietic cells was detected in 91 of 110 females (83%) using PCR of either 
      the STR sites on HUMARA or DXS15-134. The X-inactivation patterns using PCR of 
      DXS15-134 corresponded exactly with those obtained using PCR of HUMARA in 18 
      females who were heterozygous for both DXS15-134 and HUMARA. Using PCR of 
      DXS15-134, we examined the clonality of bone marrow cells separated by flow 
      cytometry in a patient with erythroleukemia (M6). Clonality was found not only in 
      myeloid lineage cells but also in B lymphocytes. The clonality assay for 
      DXS15-134 may be useful to assess for clonality of hematopoietic cells in the 
      Japanese population, when combined with the HUMARA assay.

TI  - Androgen receptor YAC transgenic mice carrying CAG 45 alleles show trinucleotide 
      repeat instability.
PG  - 959-67
AB  - X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is caused by a CAG repeat 
      expansion in the first exon of the androgen receptor (AR) gene. 
      Disease-associated alleles (37-66 CAGs) change in length when transmitted from 
      parents to offspring, with a significantly greater tendency to shift size when 
      inherited paternally. As transgenic mice carrying human AR cDNAs with 45 and 66 
      CAG repeats do not display repeat instability, we attempted to model 
      trinucleotide repeat instability by generating transgenic mice with yeast 
      artificial chromosomes (YACs) carrying AR CAG repeat expansions in their genomic 
      context. Studies of independent lines of AR YAC transgenic mice with CAG 45 
      alleles reveal intergenerational instability at an overall rate of approximately 
      10%. We also find that the 45 CAG repeat tracts are significantly more unstable 
      with maternal transmission and as the transmitting mother ages. Of all the 
      CAG/CTG repeat transgenic mice produced to date the AR YAC CAG 45 mice are 
      unstable with the smallest trinucleotide repeat mutations, suggesting that the 
      length threshold for repeat instability in the mouse may be lowered by including 
      the appropriate flanking human DNA sequences. By sequence-tagged site content 
      analysis and long range mapping we determined that one unstable transgenic line 
      has integrated an approximately 70 kb segment of the AR locus due to 
      fragmentation of the AR YAC. Identification of the cis -acting elements that 
      permit CAG tract instability and the trans -acting factors that modulate repeat 
      instability in the AR YAC CAG 45 mice may provide insights into the molecular 
      basis of trinucleotide repeat instability in humans.

TI  - Spinobulbar muscular atrophy can mimic ALS: the importance of genetic testing in 
      male patients with atypical ALS.
PG  - 568-72
AB  - The clinical presentation of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is variable and 
      overlaps with that of other motor neuron diseases such as spinobulbar muscular 
      atrophy (SBMA; Kennedy disease). With the identification of disease-specific 
      mutations such as the CAG repeat expansion in the androgen receptor in SBMA, an 
      accurate molecular diagnosis can be made in some patients with motor neuron 
      disease. To determine the extent of misdiagnosis of ALS we screened 147 male ALS 
      patients and 100 unrelated male patients from 100 familial ALS (FALS) kindreds 
      for the presence of the SBMA mutation using polymerase chain reaction methods. We 
      show that ALS was clinically misdiagnosed in 2% of sporadic cases and in two of 
      the 100 FALS kindreds. This study underscores the difficulty in distinguishing 
      SBMA from ALS clinically, particularly in patients who lack the classic signs of 
      each disease.

TI  - A recombinant form of the human BP180 ectodomain forms a collagen-like 
      homotrimeric complex.
PG  - 8821-30
AB  - BP180 is a glycoprotein constituent of the epidermal anchoring complex and a 
      major antigenic target of autoantibodies associated with bullous pemphigoid, a 
      blistering skin disease. The C-terminal extracellular domain of BP180 contains 15 
      domains composed of Gly-X-Y tandem repeats, which are predicted to form 
      collagen-like triple helices. To facilitate the structural analysis of this 
      protein, the extracellular region of human BP180 was expressed as a secreted 
      protein (sec180e) in transiently transfected COS-1 cells. Gel filtration and 
      sedimentation analyses demonstrated that sec180e exists in two forms: a globular 
      monomeric form and a high-molecular mass multimeric form with an elongated 
      conformation. Pulse-chase and cross-linking experiments established that the 
      sec180e complex is a stable homotrimeric structure which assembles prior to 
      secretion from the cell. On the basis of its calculated molecular mass, the 
      oligomeric state of the sec180e complex is 3.25. With a Stokes radius of 13.6 nm, 
      a sedimentation coefficent of 6.5 S, and a frictional ratio of 3.01, the sec180e 
      protein appears to be highly extended (length to width ratio is between 52 and 
      60), yet is more flexible than a rigid rod. BP180 isolated from human epidermis 
      was also shown to exist in a high-molecular mass complex which, like sec180e and 
      other collagenous proteins, is SDS-stable but heat-labile. These findings 
      strongly suggest that the BP180 ectodomain exists as an elongate, flexible 
      homotrimer. This trimerization is likely to result from the formation of stable 
      collagen triple-helical and coiled-coil type structures and does not depend upon 
      the presence of the cytoplasmic or transmembrane domains of this protein.

TI  - UKPDS 19: heterogeneity in NIDDM: separate contributions of IRS-1 and beta 
      3-adrenergic-receptor mutations to insulin resistance and obesity respectively 
      with no evidence for glycogen synthase gene mutations. UK Prospective Diabetes 
      Study.
PG  - 1505-11
AB  - Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), beta 3-adrenergic-receptor (beta 3-AR) and 
      glycogen synthase (GS) genes are candidate genes for non-insulin-dependent 
      diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia and obesity. We 
      studied white Caucasian subjects with NIDDM, 227 being randomly selected, 49 
      NIDDM within the top two percentiles of insulin resistance; 54 with dyslipidaemia 
      in the top quintile of triglyceride/insulin and the bottom quintile of HDL, and 
      166 non-diabetic control subjects. We examined the association of the simple 
      tandem repeat DNA polymorphisms (STRPs) near the IRS-1 and GS genes, and the 
      prevalence of mutations at codons of IRS-1 513 and 972, beta 3-AR 64 and GS 464 
      using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). The STRP alleles in IRS-1 
      were significantly different between NIDDM and control subjects (p = 0.015). The 
      IRS-1 972 mutation was significantly different between the four groups with 
      increased prevalence in the insulin resistant and dyslipidaemia subjects (18 and 
      26% compared with 11% in control subjects; p < 0.0005). Those with or without 
      IRS-1 mutations had similar clinical characteristics and impaired insulin 
      sensitivity. beta 3-AR 64 mutation was not significantly different between the 
      four groups but those with the mutation were more obese, with a test for linear 
      association between number of alleles and degree of obesity in an analysis of 
      variance showing a significant association (p = 0.029). The GS 464 mutation was 
      not detected in any of the diabetic or control subjects and the population 
      association study using GS STRP showed no difference in allelic frequencies 
      between NIDDM patients and control subjects. A mutation in lipoprotein lipase at 
      codon 291, associated in the general population with low HDL cholesterol, was not 
      at increased prevalence in the NIDDM patients with dyslipidaemia. In conclusion, 
      IRS-1 972 had an increased prevalence in subjects with insulin resistance, with 
      or without dyslipidaemia. beta 3-AR 64 was associated with increased obesity but 
      not with insulin resistance or dyslipidaemia. These separate contributions to 
      different features of NIDDM are an example of the polygenic inheritance of this 
      heterogeneous disorder.

TI  - Demonstration of an osteoblast defect in two cases of human malignant 
      osteopetrosis. Correction of the phenotype after bone marrow transplant.
PG  - 1835-42
AB  - Osteopetrosis is an inherited disorder characterized by bone sclerosis due to 
      reduced bone resorption. Here we report that human osteopetrotic osteoblast-like 
      (Ob) cells express a defective phenotype in primary cultures in vitro, and that 
      bone marrow transplant (BMT) corrects osteoblast function. DNA analysis at 
      polymorphic short-tandem repeat loci from donor, recipient, and primary Ob-like 
      cells pre-BMT and 2 yr post-BMT revealed that Ob were still of recipient origin 
      post-BMT. Osteopetrotic Ob-like cells obtained pre-BMT showed normal and abnormal 
      1,25(OH)2D3-induced alkaline phosphatase (ALPase) and osteocalcin production, 
      respectively, and failed to produce macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) 
      in response to IL-1a and TNF-alpha. These parameters were all normalized in 
      primary Ob-like cells prepared 2 yr post-BMT. X-linked clonality analysis at the 
      human androgen receptor (HUMARA) locus revealed that osteoblasts showed a 
      polyclonal and an oligoclonal derivation pre- and post-BMT respectively, 
      indicating that a limited number of progenitor reconstituted this population. 
      Because osteoblasts were still of recipient origin post-BMT, this suggests that 
      functional osteoclasts, due to the replacement of hematopoeitic cells, provided a 
      local microenvironment in vivo triggering the differentiation and/or recruitment 
      of a limited number of functional osteoblasts.

TI  - CAG-repeat expansion in androgen receptor in Kennedy's disease is not a loss of 
      function mutation.
PG  - 149-56
AB  - Expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeats in androgen receptor gene is present in 
      patients with a rare X-linked inherited form of motor neuron disorder termed 
      Kennedy's disease or spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). This is a late 
      onset progressive disease often associated with mild signs of androgen 
      insensitivity. Defects in androgen receptor (AR) action have been linked to the 
      expansion of the CAG trinucleotide repeats and postulated to be the cause of the 
      disease. We have identified a trinucleotide repeat of 45 in the N-terminus of the 
      AR in two brothers with SBMA and several members in their family (range in the 
      general population is 11-35). Treatment of the patients with androgens failed to 
      improve their clinical symptoms and provided no hint of an anomalous function of 
      the AR. Consistently, functional analysis of the mutant receptor showed hormone 
      binding, transactivation and transrepression potentials identical to that of the 
      wild-type receptor. These results together argue against SBMA being a loss of 
      function mutation of the AR.

TI  - Differential pattern in tissue-specific somatic mosaicism of expanded CAG 
      trinucleotide repeats in dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, Machado-Joseph 
      disease, and X-linked recessive spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.
PG  - 43-50
AB  - We investigated the somatic mosaicism of trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 
      neural and nonneural tissues of a dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) 
      patient and their correlation to the topographical distribution of the 
      pathological involvement. The spatial pattern of tissue-specific somatic 
      mosaicism in the CAG repeat size was significantly different among the DRPLA, MJD 
      and SBMA patients. The size of the major bands of the mutant CAG repeat allele 
      was significantly smaller in the cerebellar cortex in both DRPLA and MJD patients 
      by 6 and 2 repeat units respectively and larger in the colon and liver of DRPLA 
      by 5 repeats or more. There were also 1-2 repeat-sized small variations of major 
      band size among the neural tissues in DRPLA. In contrast, there was no 
      tissue-specific variation of major bands of CAG repeats and diversity of extra 
      bands among the examined tissues including the cerebellum in the SBMA patient. 
      There was no parallel occurrence of tissue-specific CAG instability and severity 
      of neuropathological involvement in the neural and nonneural tissues of DRPLA, 
      MJD and SBMA patients. Lack of significant tissue-specific somatic mosaicism in 
      SBMA including the cerebellar cortex may suggest that CAG repeat expansion in the 
      mutant androgen receptor gene is far more stable compared with that in DRPLA and 
      MJD as well as those reported in Huntington's disease.

TI  - Somatic stability of the expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat in X-linked spinal and

PG  - 32-7
AB  - Expansion of trinucleotide repeats has now been associated with eight inherited 
      diseases: X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, two fragile X syndromes, 
      myotonic dystrophy, Huntington's disease, spinocerebellar ataxia type I, 
      dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy and Machado-Joseph disease. It has been 
      shown that these expanded DNA repeats are unstable in number when transmitted 
      from parents to offspring ("meiotic instability"), while somatic variation in 
      repeat number has also been found in the fragile X syndrome and myotonic 
      dystrophy. Moderate meiotic instability has been demonstrated in X-linked spinal 
      and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA, Kennedy's disease). In order to determine if 
      the expanded CAG repeat in SBMA also shows somatic instability, we compared 
      different tissues from two patients with SBMA. We then examined the in vitro 
      stability of the CAG repeat expansion by analyzing fibroblast cell cultures. 
      Length comparison of expanded CAG repeats from all these materials clearly 
      demonstrates that the CAG trinucleotide repeat in SBMA does not exhibit somatic 
      variation.

TI  - Prevalence, genetics and clinical presentation of chronic granulomatous disease 
      in Sweden.
PG  - 1386-94
AB  - To estimate the prevalence of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) in Sweden, an 
      inquiry asking for known and possible CGD cases was mailed to paediatric, 
      internal medicine and infectious disease departments all over Sweden. The 
      detected patients were characterized as to genetics and the clinical 
      presentation. Twenty-one patients (belonging to 16 different families) were 
      found, corresponding to a prevalence of approximately 1/450,000 individuals. The 
      patients with X-linked disease, lacking a functional gp91phox protein (n = 12), 
      comprised 57% and 43% of the patients had an autosomal recessive (AR) disease 
      lacking p47phox (n = 7) or p67phox (n = 1), respectively. All unrelated patients 
      with X-linked disease displayed different gene abnormalities such as point 
      mutations predicting nonsense (n = 3), missense (n = 1) or splice site mutations 
      (n = 2), but also a total deletion and a unique 40 base pair duplicature 
      insertion. The patients with p47phox-deficiency showed a GT deletion at a GTGT 
      tandem repeat, and the p67phox-deficient patient displayed a heterozygous 
      in-frame deletion of AAG combined with a large deletion in the other allele. 
      Three patients died during the study period, two from pseudomonas cepacia 
      infections. Patients with X-linked disease had more frequent infections (mean of 
      1.7 per year), than the patients with AR inheritance (0.5 infections per year). 
      The most common infections were dermal abscesses (n = 111), followed by 
      lymphadenitis (n = 82) and pneumonias (n = 73). Inflammatory bowel disease-like 
      symptoms, mimicking Crohn's disease of the colon, was seen in three CGD patients.

TI  - Identification of novel insertion elements, restriction fragment length 
      polymorphism patterns, and discontinuous 23S rRNA in Lyme disease spirochetes: 
      phylogenetic analyses of rRNA genes and their intergenic spacers in Borrelia 
      japonica sp. nov. and genomic group 21038 (Borrelia andersonii sp. nov.) 
      isolates.
PG  - 2427-34
AB  - Borrelia spp. associated with Lyme disease possess an rRNA gene organization 
      consisting of a single 16S rRNA gene followed by a spacer of several kilobases 
      and a tandem repeat of a 23S (rrl)-5S (rrf) rRNA gene cluster. The restriction 
      fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns for these genes have been widely 
      used to classify Lyme disease spirochete isolates. We analyzed the rRNA gene 
      organization and sequences for two Ixodes ovatus isolates from Japan (IKA2 and 
      HO14) and two group 21038 isolates associated with Ixodes dentatus ticks or 
      rabbits from North America (isolates 21038 and 19857). This analysis revealed 
      unique polymorphisms not previously described in other Lyme disease spirochete 
      isolates. The molecular basis of these polymorphisms was determined by Southern 
      blotting and PCR analyses. Only one continuous copy of the rrl-rrf gene cluster 
      was identified in isolates IKA2, 19857, and 21038. The second rrl-rrf gene 
      cluster is entirely absent from the IKA2 genome. In isolates 19857 and 21038, an 
      intervening sequence is present, resulting in a fragment rrlB gene. The insertion 
      site of this intervening sequence element differed in each isolate. While 
      isolates 19857 and 21038 were found to carry a fragmented rrlB gene, they lacked 
      rrfB. To determine if these rRNA polymorphisms were indicative of an underlying 
      phylogenetic divergence, sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA (rrs) genes was 
      conducted. The phylogenies inferred from rrs sequence analysis suggest that the 
      polymorphisms resulted from recent mutational events. In addition, the 
      phylogenetic analyses also support the proposed species status of Borrelia 
      japonica sp. nov. and indicate that isolates of genomic group 21038 belong to a 
      previously undescribed species for which we propose the nomenclature Borrelia 
      andersonii sp. nov.

      on the human androgen-receptor (HUMARA) gene.
PG  - 838-44
AB  - The clonalities in white blood cells (WBC) of blood and nucleated bone marrow 
      cells from patients with refractory anaemia and aplastic anaemia were examined by 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods using the polymorphic short tandem repeat 
      (STR) on the human androgen-receptor gene (HUMARA). Peripheral blood samples were 
      obtained from 12 female patients, six with aplastic anaemia (AA) and six with 
      refractory anaemia (RA). Peripheral blood was fractionated into granulocytes, 
      lymphocytes, T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes. DNA was extracted from each 
      fraction. Bone marrow samples were obtained from seven female patients (three 
      with AA and four with RA). Sorted CD34 positive cells were cultured in a 
      semisolid culture system. DNA was extracted from a 14-day haemopoietic colony. 
      The clonal pattern was assessed using HUMARA gene STR polymorphism and the 
      differential methylation pattern of nearby cytosine residues by PCR methods. Four 
      of six (67%) AA and two of six (33%) RA patients had a monoclonal proliferating 
      pattern in their granulocytes. The ratio of the numbers of minority colonies per 
      majority colonies (m/M ratio) was examined for seven patients (three AA and four 
      RA). In patients who had a clonal haemopoietic pattern in peripheral WBC the 
      ratio was under 0.4 but not zero. In contrast, patients exhibiting a polyclonal 
      pattern had an m/M ratio above 0.8. We concluded that some normal or heterogenous 
      haemopoietic clones, not only MDS but also AA, may remain in the bone marrow, 
      although almost all colonies were derived from a single pathogenic clone when the 
      clonality pattern exhibited monoclonality in peripheral blood analysis.

TI  - CAG repeat length variation in sperm from a patient with Kennedy's disease.
PG  - 303-5
AB  - Using a modified sperm typing protocol, the mutation frequency of the CAG repeat 
      region at the androgen receptor locus has been measured using a rare semen sample 
      from an individual with spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). Among 258 X 
      chromosome-containing sperm, 19% had a repeat number equal to the donor's somatic 
      DNA (47 repeats), 66% were expansions and 15% were contractions. The average 
      expansion was 2.7 repeats. More than half of the expansions involved one or two 
      repeats; the largest was 11 repeats. 68% of the contractions were also one or two 
      repeats but six (16%) were very large (12-25 repeats). One contraction generated 
      an allele in an intermediate size range (33-39 repeats). Such alleles have not 
      been observed among more than 900 normal and SBMA X-chromosomes that have been 
      examined. Comparison of the SBMA sperm typing results with mutation frequency 
      data on normal alleles supports the hypothesis that trinucleotide repeat 
      expansions may have a different molecular origin than contractions.

TI  - Proximal myotonic myopathy: a new dominant disorder with myotonia, muscle 
      weakness, and cataracts.
PG  - 1448-52
AB  - We describe three families with a dominantly inherited disorder. Affected 
      individuals have myotonia, proximal muscle weakness, and cataracts. There was no 
      abnormal CTG repeat expansion of the myotonic dystrophy (DM) gene in DNA from 
      blood and muscle. The structure of the three families permitted linkage analysis, 
      and there is no linkage to the gene loci for DM or to the loci for the muscle 
      chloride channel disorders or muscle sodium channel disorders. The collection of 
      symptoms in these three families seems to represent a new disorder.

TI  - Myotonic dystrophy with no trinucleotide repeat expansion.
PG  - 269-72
AB  - We report 3 patients from 2 families with myotonic dystrophy who do not show an 
      abnormal expansion of CTG trinucleotide repeats within the myotonic dystrophy 
      gene. Characteristic features of myotonic dystrophy in these patients were 
      frontal balding, cataracts, cardiac conduction abnormalities, and testicular 
      atrophy with myotonia and muscle weakness. Results of muscle histopathology were 
      consistent with myotonic dystrophy. Genetic analysis of leukocyte and muscle DNA 
      showed a normal number of CTG repeats. The demonstration of normal CTG repeat 
      number for the myotonic dystrophy gene does not exclude the diagnosis of myotonic 
      dystrophy.

TI  - Myotonic dystrophy patients have larger CTG expansions in skeletal muscle than in 
      leukocytes.
PG  - 104-7
AB  - The genetic basis of myotonic dystrophy is an unstable expansion of CTG repeats 
      located in a gene on chromosome 19 that encodes a putative serine/threonine 
      protein kinase. We studied the somatic mosaicism of the (CTG)n expansion in 
      myotonic dystrophy patients. (CTG)n expansions were 2- to 13-fold greater in DNA 
      isolated from skeletal muscle than in DNA from leukocytes in 10 of 11 patients 
      with myotonic dystrophy. Different muscles of the same individual showed similar 
      (CTG)n expansions. In postmortem tissues from an adult patient, (CTG)n expansions 
      in brain, skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, testes, and liver were all greater 
      than in leukocytes. Normal myotonic dystrophy gene alleles from 7 healthy 
      subjects had the same number of CTG repeats in leukocytes and muscle. The 
      myotonic dystrophy mutation displays pronounced heterogeneity in somatic cells. 
      The (CTG)n expansion observed in peripheral blood leukocytes is not necessarily 
      representative of the repeat expansion in affected tissues, such as skeletal 
      muscle and myocardium. In some patients with myotonic dystrophy, the predictive 
      value of genetic analysis based on leukocyte DNA may be limited.

TI  - Fluorescent approaches to diagnosis of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and quantitative 
      analysis of carrier status.
PG  - 311-24
AB  - Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by molecular 
      defects within the HPRT gene. Deletional forms of this syndrome, most of which 
      are inherited, account for 15% of the cases. In addition, a large percentage of 
      cases are due to de novo point mutations. We have used complementary 
      fluorescence-based PCR assays to analyse disease-causing mutations in three 
      unrelated families: (1) inheritance of dye-labelled PCR products of linked 
      polymorphic loci mapping within and flanking the HPRT gene; (2) dye-labelled exon 
      dosage analysis and (3) automated fluorescence-based DNA sequence analysis. Our 
      results using fluorescent, dye-tagged PCR products show that inheritance of two 
      polymorphic small tandem repeats, HPRTB [AGAT]n, mapping within intron 3 of the 
      HPRT gene, and the CA-repeat at DXS294 can be used to establish linkage to the 
      disease. In addition, we modified a previously described PCR protocol to use 
      fluorescent dye-labelled oligoprimers and an ABI Gene Scanner in order to rapidly 
      quantitate deletional forms of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Quantitative PCR analysis of 
      individual exons followed by dosage analysis confirmed a deletion encompassing 
      exon 9. A similar approach was used to confirm a previously described HPRT gene 
      duplication involving exons 2 and 3. In this analysis, we co-amplified the HPRTB 
      [AGAT]n and HUMARA [AGC]n repeats and confirmed increased exon dosage in carriers 
      for the duplication. DNA sequence analysis remains the method of choice for 
      delineating new disease-causing mutations, most of which are non-deletional forms 
      of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. We have also used a cycle-sequencing strategy employing 
      dye-labelled dideoxy terminators and a laser-activated, fluorescence-emission DNA 
      sequencer in order to define carrier status in 10 family members at risk for 
      Lesch-Nyhan syndrome due to a splice donor mutation in intron 7. Our DNA sequence 
      analyses corroborate small tandem repeat (STR) inheritance patterns in this 
      family. Multiple fluorescence-based strategies should facilitate rapid diagnosis 
      of the various Lesch-Nyhan disease-causing mutations.

TI  - Strong correlation between the number of CAG repeats in androgen receptor genes 
      and the clinical onset of features of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.
PG  - 2300-2
AB  - X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), a motor neuron disease 
      associated with androgen insensitivity, is caused by androgen receptor gene 
      mutations with an increased number of tandem CAG repeats in exon 1. We 
      investigated the increased number of CAG repeats in androgen receptor genes of 19 
      SBMA patients and found that this correlated strongly with the age at onset of 
      muscle weakness. Thus, SBMA is the first genetic disease in which a strong 
      correlation between the degree of genetic abnormality (number of CAG tandem 
      repeats) and clinical phenotypic expression is demonstrable. The results further 
      indicate that androgen gene mutation is directly involved in the degeneration of 
      motor neurons.
