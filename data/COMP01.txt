TI  - Expansion of KRAS hotspot mutations reactive T cells from human pancreatic tumors 
      using autologous T cells as the antigen-presenting cells.

AB  - Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with expanded tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) or 
      TCR gene-modified T cells (TCR-T) that recognize mutant KRAS neo-antigens can 
      mediate tumor regression in patients with advanced pancreatic ductal 
      adenocarcinoma (PDAC) (Tran et al in N Engl J Med, 375:2255-2262, 2016; Leidner 
      et al in N Engl J Med, 386:2112-2119, 2022). The mutant KRAS-targeted ACT holds 
      great potential to achieve durable clinical responses for PDAC, which has had no 
      meaningful improvement over 40 years. However, the wide application of mutant 
      KRAS-centric ACT is currently limited by the rarity of TIL that recognize the 
      mutant KRAS. In addition, PDAC is generally recognized as a poorly immunogenic 
      tumor, and TILs in PDAC are less abundant than in immunogenic tumors such as 
      melanoma. To increase the success rate of TIL production, we adopted a 
      well-utilized K562-based artificial APC (aAPC) that expresses 4-1BBL as the 
      costimulatory molecules to enhance the TIL production from PDCA. However, 
      stimulation with K562-based aAPC led to a rapid loss of specificity to mutant 
      KRAS. To selectively expand neo-antigen-specific T cells, particularly mKRAS, 
      from the TILs, we used tandem mini gene-modified autologous T cells (TMG-T) as 
      the novel aAPC. Using this modified IVS protocol, we successfully generated TIL 
      cultures specifically reactive to mKRAS (G12V). We believe that autologous TMG-T 
      cells provide a reliable source of autologous APC to expand a rare population of 
      neoantigen-specific T cells in TILs.

TI  - Efficacy of Miniscrew-Assisted Rapid Palatal Expansion (MARPE) in late 
      adolescents and adults with the Dutch Maxillary Expansion Device: a prospective 
      clinical cohort study.
PG  - 6253-6263
LID - 10.1007/s00784-022-04577-9 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To provide a higher degree of evidence on the efficacy of 
      Miniscrew-Assisted Rapid Palatal Expansion (MARPE) in late adolescents and 
      adults, thereby applying the Dutch Maxillary Expansion Device (D-MED). MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: D-MED was developed as an individualized, 3D-designed, and 
      fabricated MARPE appliance supported by 4 palatal miniscrews. Patients from the 
      age of 16 onwards with transverse maxillary deficiency were enrolled 
      consecutively. Pre-expansion and immediate post-expansion CBCTs and intra-oral 
      scans were acquired and measurements of skeletal, alveolar, and dental expansion 
      as well as dental and periodontal side-effects were performed. RESULTS: 
      Thirty-four patients were enrolled (8 men, 26 women) with mean age 
      27.0 +/- 9.4 years. A success rate of 94.1% was achieved (32/34 patients). The mean 
      expansion duration, or mean observation time, was 31.7 +/- 8.0 days. The mean 
      expansion at the maxillary first molars (M1) and first premolars (P1) was 
      6.56 +/- 1.70 mm and 4.19 +/- 1.29 mm, respectively. The expansion was 60.4 +/- 20.1% 
      skeletal, 8.1 +/- 27.6% alveolar, and 31.6 +/- 20.1% dental at M1 and 92.2 +/- 14.5% 
      skeletal, 0.0 +/- 18.6% alveolar, and 7.8 +/- 17.7% dental at P1, which was both 
      statistically (p < 0.001) and clinically significant. Buccal dental tipping 
      (3.88 +/- 3.92 degrees  M1; 2.29 +/- 3.89 degrees  P1), clinical crown height increase 
      (0.12 +/- 0.31 mm M1; 0.04 +/- 0.22 mm P1), and buccal bone thinning 
      (- 0.31 +/- 0.49 mm M1; - 0.01 +/- 0.45 mm P1) were observed, while root resorption 
      could not be evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: MARPE by application of D-MED manifested its 
      efficacy in a prospective clinical setting, delivering a high amount of skeletal 
      expansion with limited side-effects in late adolescents and adults. CLINICAL 
      RELEVANCE: Higher quality evidence is supportive of MARPE as a safe and 
      successful non-surgical treatment option for transverse maxillary deficiency.

TI  - An ICU Expansion of a Novel Chaplain Intervention, "This is My Story," to Support 
      Interdisciplinary Medical Teams Delivering Care to Non-Communicative Patients in 
      an Academic Medical Center.
PG  - 83-97
LID - 10.1007/s10943-022-01567-9 [doi]
AB  - The intervention "This is My Story" (TIMS) was previously developed and presented 
      as a case study involving chaplains and support to non-communicative patients 
      (Tracey et al in J Religion Health, 60(5):3282-3290, 2021). This further 
      investigation aims to determine feasibility by looking at eight criteria: 
      acceptability, demand, implementation, practicality, adaptation, integration, 
      expansion, and limited-efficacy testing (Bowen et al in Am J Prev Med 
      36(5):452-457, 2009). Chaplains conducted recorded conversation with a patient's 
      loved one, then it was edited for brevity and succinctness, and uploaded to the 
      patient's medical chart and can be listened to at any time by medical providers. 
      A completed interview, posted to the patient's electronic medical record (EMR), 
      and able to be listened to by the medical team, was found to be contingent upon 
      two factors: proximity to time between referral to call completion and amount of 
      clinical experience of the chaplain.

      palatal expansion.

LID - 10.5664/jcsm.9968 [doi]
AB  - Children with Down syndrome (DS) have distinct orofacial structures that 
      predispose them to sleep-disordered breathing. The management options for 
      obstructive sleep apnea include continuous positive airway pressure, 
      adenotonsillectomy, mandibular advancement, and maxillary expansion. However, 
      most of these treatment options are less effective or less viable for children 
      with DS. Rapid maxillary expansion with a fixed orthodontic appliance is a viable 
      alternative for DS patients because it separates the midpalatal suture and 
      dilates the airway, regardless of the patient's compliance. We present a case of 
      a 15-year-old boy with DS and severe obstructive sleep apnea, which dramatically 
      improved with rapid maxillary expansion and subsequent orthodontic treatment. 
      Although only the short-term changes have been presented in this report, this 
      case emphasizes the need for further discussions on the viability of rapid 
      maxillary expansion for treating obstructive sleep apnea in children with DS.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Several conditions can cause penile length and girth loss. Surgical 
      techniques have been used to restore these penile alterations in patients with 
      severe erectile dysfunction during penile prosthesis implantation. One technique 
      uses multiple small incisions in a mesh pattern (similar to a skin mesh) with 
      satisfactory curvature correction without using a graft, however, this technique 
      does not allow simultaneous increase in penile length and girth. AIM: To identify 
      a new surgical technique that increases both the length and girth at the same 
      place on the corpora cavernosa (CC), allowing a simultaneously longitudinal and 
      transverse increase of the tunica albuginea. METHODS: A sheet with a star-shaped 
      perforation was created using a mathematical model to allow a longitudinal and 
      transversal increase in the material. Two previously published penile model 
      simulators, with and without deformity, were used to test the mechanical 
      modification of this incision pattern in the CC. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The effect 
      of the incisions pattern on the geometry of the CC simulator. RESULTS: The 
      star-shaped incision (auxetic) simultaneously increased the length, girth, and 
      volume of the CC simulator. This auxetic technique could correct any penile 
      deformity, re-establishing the original penile anatomy. The new auxetic incision 
      is only a conceptual and experimental technique awaiting clinical evidence. 
      CONCLUSION: The data presented here show that the auxetic technique successfully 
      increases both the length and girth at the same place on the CC simulators, 
      opening a new potential solution to correct challenging cases of complex penile 
      deformities and to restore volume loss. Miranda A, Auxetic Expansion of the

TI  - Can Tissue Expansion Reconstruction in the Trunk of Children Increase the Risk of 
      Scoliosis?
PG  - 88-97
LID - 10.1177/2292550320933671 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: We hypothesize that treatment of significant truncal lesions with 
      truncal tissue expanders and subsequent flap surgery in pediatric patients may 
      increase the risk of scoliosis. This study aims to investigate any relationship 
      between tissue expansion (TE) and scoliosis and to compare the prevalence of 
      scoliosis in our tissue expander population to the general population. METHODS: 
      Health records of patients who underwent truncal TE at BC Children's Hospital 
      between 1997 and 2017 were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. The 
      cross-sectional component of the study consisted of radiological imaging to 
      establish the presence or absence of scoliosis. RESULTS: We identified 28 
      patients who underwent truncal TE over the study period. Ten had a scoliosis 
      X-ray on their chart or as a part of the study. Three (10.7%) patients were 
      identified as having developed scoliosis after TE. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that 
      pediatric TE patients be made aware of the potential complication of scoliosis 
      and be followed closely in the years during and after their treatment, in order 
      to allow for preventative measures, early diagnosis and early management (if 
      required).

AB  - Re-expansion pulmonary edema (RPE) is a rare complication that may occur after 
      treatment of lung collapse caused by pneumothorax, atelectasis, or pleural 
      effusion. The amount of fluid drained and the degree of pleural suction influence 
      the development of RPE. We present a case of RPE in a critically ill patient of 
      scrub typhus with rheumatic heart disease, after draining only 800 mL of pleural 
      fluid, thereby proving that the complex cardiac and pulmonary interactions play 
      an important role in the development of RPE. How to cite this article: Khanoria

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is 10-15% in 
      women of reproductive age. Its characteristics are (i) clinical or biochemical 
      hyperandrogenism, (ii) oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, and (iii) polycystic ovaries 
      on ultrasound. PCOS is associated with lower quality of life, depression, 
      anxiety, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Treatment commonly entails oral 
      contraceptive use to lower endogenous androgen levels. Androgen levels and 
      comorbidities may affect sexual function. Previous studies have addressed a 
      limited range of possible contributing factors. We will assess sexual function as 
      well as genital and self-reported sexual arousal in a laboratory setting in women 
      with PCOS compared to an age-matched healthy control group. Modulation by 
      biopsychosocial factors mentioned will be studied. METHODS: This is a multicenter 
      prospective case control study. The study population includes healthy women with 
      and without PCOS, aged 18-40 years, in a stable heterosexual relationship for at 
      least 6 months. Power is calculated at 67 participants in each group. 
      Anticipating a drop out of 10%, 150 participants will be recruited. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: The main outcomes measured are sexual function using the Female Sexual 
      Function Index, Sexual Desire Inventory, and Female Sexual Distress 
      Scale-Revised; genital sexual arousal measured as vaginal pulse amplitude; and 
      self-reported sexual arousal in response to erotic stimuli in a laboratory 
      setting. The mediators that will be investigated include testosterone, free 
      androgen levels, oral contraceptive use, sensitivity to androgens (using CAG 
      repeat length), body mass index, body image, mental health, and self-esteem. 
      CONCLUSION: Strengths of this study are the inclusion of a broad range of 
      biopsychosocial outcome measures including DNA analysis, a healthy control group, 
      and standardized assessment of genital and self-reported sexual arousal in a 
      laboratory setting. With the design of this study we aim to provide an insight 
      into which biopsychosocial factors associated with PCOS are related to sexual 
      function, and how sexual function may be affected by treatment. These new 
      insights may help to improve clinical management of PCOS while improving the 
      quality of life. Pastoor H, Both S, Timman R, et al. Sexual Function in Women

AB  - BACKGROUND: Peyronie's disease, diabetes, trauma, pelvic surgeries, and aging are 
      conditions that promote penile fibrosis and trigger erectile dysfunction 
      associated with penile reduction. These pathologies require an objective 
      preoperative diagnosis and intraoperative management of penile shrinkage. AIM: 
      The goal is to develop a non-grafting procedure to promote lengthening using 
      geometric patterns of multiple staggered small cuts on the tunica albuginea with 
      an optimal ratio between tissue expansion and resistance to confine the cylinders 
      inside the corpora cavernosa. METHODS: Between February 2016 and February 2019, 
      416 patients suffering penile shortening with or without Peyronie's disease 
      received implants using the tunica expansion procedures (TEP). Incisions were 
      distributed in respective areas of the tunica to allow maximum expansion while 
      maintaining strength to confine prosthetic cylinders within the corpora cavernosa 
      to prevent bulges and denting. OUTCOMES: In accordance with these principles, 
      surgical objectives and patient satisfaction were achieved in length and girth 
      restoration regardless of the type of implant used to obtain adequate axial 
      rigidity. RESULTS: The sample of 416 patients included 287 cases of Peyronie's 
      disease having a mean axial deviation of 51 degrees  (0-90 degrees ) whose curvature was 
      corrected in surgery, with pressure from the cylinders maintaining straightness 
      for malleable and inflatable devices. Tunica constriction in 40.86% of cases was 
      corrected with vertical relaxing incisions. Ventral glanspexy was performed 
      intraoperatively in 92.8% of patients to prevent hypermobility. A penile gain of 
      3.3 cm (2-6) was measured intraoperatively. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Diagnosis of 
      penile shortening was performed by a stretch length test and pharmacologically 
      induced erection together with the patient's subjective opinion of penile loss. 
      Lengthening procedure depends on the limit of the dissected neurovascular bundle. 
      The patient and surgeon select the type of implant in accordance with his 
      individual anatomic characteristics. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: The TEP strategy 
      is a non-grafting procedure based on tissue restitution by expansion instead of 
      substitution, which provides surgeons a solution for penile enlargement to the 
      limit of the dissected neurovascular bundle. CONCLUSIONS: The TEP strategy has 
      been demonstrated to be safe and effective to resolve problems of penile size 
      reduction independently of penile curvature. It eliminates grafting and improves 
      penile lengthening techniques using small, staggered cuts on the tunica 
      albuginea, while maintaining tunica structural resistance to contain cylinders 
      inside the corpora, preventing bulges and denting, facilitating tissue 
      regeneration, and improving axial rigidity. Paulo H. Egydio, An Innovative

AB  - PURPOSE: Mediastinal radiation therapy (RT) in patients with lymphoma implies 
      involuntary coronary artery (CA) exposure, resulting in an increased risk of 
      coronary artery disease (CAD). Accurate delineation of CAs may spare them from 
      higher RT doses. However, heart motion affects the estimation of the dose 
      received by CAs. An expansion margin (planning organ at risk volume [PRV]), 
      encompassing the nearby area where CAs displace, may compensate for these 
      uncertainties, reducing CA dose and CAD risk. Our study aimed to evaluate if a 
      planning process optimized on CA-specific PRVs, rather than just on CAs, could 
      provide any dosimetric or clinical benefit. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Forty patients 
      receiving RT for mediastinal lymphomas were included. We contoured left main 
      trunk, left anterior descending, left circumflex, and right coronary arteries. An 
      isotropic PRV was then applied to all CAs, in accordance with literature data. A 
      comparison was then performed by optimizing treatment plans either on CAs or on 
      PRVs, to detect any difference in CA sparing in terms of maximum (D(max)), median 
      (D(med)), and mean (D(mean)) dose. We then investigated, through risk modeling, 
      if any dosimetric benefit obtained with the PRV-related optimization process 
      could translate to a lower risk of ischemic complications. RESULTS: Plan 
      optimization on PRVs demonstrated a significant dose reduction (range, 7%-9%) in 
      D(max), D(med), and D(mean) for the whole coronary tree, and even higher dose 
      reductions when vessels were located 5- to 20-mm from PTV (range, 13%-15%), 
      especially for left main trunk and left circumflex (range, 16%-21%). This 
      translated to a mean risk reduction of developing CAD of 12% (P < .01), which 
      increased to 17% when CAs were located 5- to 20-mm from PTV. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Integration of CA-related PRVs in the optimization process reduces the dose 
      received by CAs and translates to a meaningful prevention of CAD risk in patients 
      with lymphoma treated with mediastinal RT.

AB  - Autoimmune diseases are characterized by alteration in balance of various 
      cytokines. Rheumatoid arthritis is a well-known inflammatory disease leading to 
      destruction of cartilage at knee and hands. Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is a 
      common autoimmune model for rheumatoid arthritis study. Here, we have 
      investigated the therapeutic role of medicarpin, a natural pterocarpan with known 
      anti-osteoclastogenic activities, in postmenopausal polyarthritis model of DBA/1J 
      mice. For this, mice were ovariectomized and CIA was induced in OVx animals with 
      primary immunization. After 21 days, booster dose was injected in Ovariectomy 
      (OVx) mice to develop postmenopausal poly-arthritis mice model. Medicarpin 
      treatment in mice at dose of 10.0 mg/kg/body wt was started after 21 days of 
      primary immunization for one month of time period every day orally. We found that 
      medicarpin prevented alteration of TH-17/Treg ratio in CIA model leading to 
      reduced osteoclastogenesis. Micro Computed Tomography (Micro-CT) analysis 
      demonstrated that medicarpin prevents cartilage erosion in joints and restores 
      loss of trabeculae parameters in distal tibia. Treatment with medicarpin also 
      prevented alteration of various cytokines level by down-regulating various 
      pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-17A, while up-regulating 
      anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in CIA model of mice. Biological marker of 
      arthritis is cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP). COMP level was 
      up-regulated in CIA induced mice while treatment with medicarpin significantly 
      restored the serum level of COMP compared with untreated groups. Cartilage 
      staining by Safranin-O also indicates that cartilage destruction in joints of CIA 
      mice was prevented by medicarpin treatment. From this study, we can conclude that 
      medicarpin is effective in preventing arthritis in post-menopausal conditions.

TI  - Rationale and design of two randomized sham-controlled trials of catheter-based 
      renal denervation in subjects with uncontrolled hypertension in the absence 
      (SPYRAL HTN-OFF MED Pivotal) and presence (SPYRAL HTN-ON MED Expansion) of 
      antihypertensive medications: a novel approach using Bayesian design.
PG  - 289-302
LID - 10.1007/s00392-020-01595-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The SPYRAL HTN clinical trial program was initiated with two 
      80-patient pilot studies, SPYRAL HTN-OFF MED and SPYRAL HTN-ON MED, which 
      provided biological proof of principle that renal denervation has a blood 
      pressure-lowering effect versus sham controls for subjects with uncontrolled 
      hypertension in the absence or presence of antihypertensive medications, 
      respectively. TRIAL DESIGN: Two multicenter, prospective, randomized, 
      sham-controlled trials have been designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
      catheter-based renal denervation for the reduction of blood pressure in subjects 
      with hypertension in the absence (SPYRAL HTN-OFF MED Pivotal) or presence (SPYRAL 
      HTN-ON MED Expansion) of antihypertensive medications. The primary efficacy 
      endpoint is baseline-adjusted change from baseline in 24-h ambulatory systolic 
      blood pressure. The primary safety endpoint is incidence of major adverse events 
      at 1 month after randomization (or 6 months in cases of new renal artery 
      stenosis). Both trials utilize a Bayesian design to allow for prespecified 
      interim analyses to take place, and thus, the final sample sizes are dependent on 
      whether enrollment is stopped at the first or second interim analysis. SPYRAL 
      HTN-OFF MED Pivotal will enroll up to 300 subjects and SPYRAL HTN-ON MED 
      Expansion will enroll up to 221 subjects. A novel Bayesian power prior approach 
      will leverage historical information from the pilot studies, with a degree of 
      discounting determined by the level of agreement with data from the prospectively 
      powered studies. CONCLUSIONS: The Bayesian paradigm represents a novel and 
      promising approach in device-based hypertension trials. CLINICAL TRIAL

AB  - NONE: Idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is characterized by 
      vocalizations and complex motor behaviors during sleep. We report a case of a 
      44-year-old male with a 20-year history of dream enactment behavior that was 
      incidentally captured on a polysomnogram during an evaluation for obstructive 
      sleep apnea. Genetic testing found the patient had a homozygous deletion for one 
      of the five tandem repeats in exon 18 of the PER3 gene. This case highlights a 
      potential genetic basis for idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior 
      disorder. CITATION: Brock MS, Shirley S, Rohena L, Moore BA, Mysliwiec V.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The effect of testosterone depends on the exposure of and the 
      sensitivity of the androgen receptor (AR). It has been shown that a 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) trinucleotide repeat polymorphism in the AR gene 
      has an impact on AR functional capacity in men. However, large studies are 
      lacking on the impact of this polymorphism on female sexual function. AIM: To 
      determine whether the CAG repeat length was associated with different aspects of 
      women's sexual function and dysfunction, including desire, arousal, lubrication, 
      orgasm, satisfaction, sexual pain, and sexually related personal distress. 
      METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 529 healthy women, aged 19-65 years. 
      Participants completed a questionnaire to provide demographic and sexual data. 
      The CAG repeat length was analyzed in a blood sample. The correlations between 
      CAG repeat lengths and different aspects of sexual function were calculated. 
      Independent Student t-tests were performed to evaluate differences in the mean 
      number of CAG repeats in the short and long allele and of the biallelic mean 
      length determined by simple calculation and X-inactivation analysis, 
      respectively, between women with sexual problems and women without sexual 
      problems. P values <.05 were considered statistically significant. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURE: We used the Female Sexual Function Index, with 6 subdomains, to 
      distinguish between women without and women with impaired sexual function; low 
      sexual desire; impaired arousal, lubrication, or orgasm; diminished satisfaction; 
      or pain during sex. The Female Sexual Distress Scale was used to measure sexually 
      related personal distress. RESULTS: Overall, we found that increasing numbers of 
      CAG repeats were correlated to increased sexual function. We found that women 
      with problems achieving orgasm had a significantly lower number of CAG repeats 
      than women that reported no problems reaching orgasm. We found no associations 
      between CAG repeat lengths and other aspects of female sexual dysfunction, 
      including hypoactive sexual desire disorder. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The results 
      could indicate an impact of the AR on women's sexual function, including the 
      ability to reach orgasm. STRENGTH & LIMITATIONS: This is a large study using 
      validated sexual questionnaires. A limitation is the cross-sectional design. 
      Owing to the study design, this study is explorative and hypothesis generating. 
      CONCLUSION: In this large cross-sectional study, we demonstrated that CAG repeat 
      length is positively correlated to sexual function and that women with a reduced 
      ability to reach orgasm had smaller numbers of CAG repeats in the AR gene than 
      women with no orgasmic problems. These findings indicated that androgens and ARs 
      might play a role in women's sexual function. Wahlin-Jacobsen S, Flanagan JN,

TI  - Androgen Receptor CAG Repeat Length as a Risk Factor of Late-Onset Hypogonadism 
      in a Korean Male Population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Testosterone action is mediated through the androgen receptor (AR), 
      whose sensitivity is influenced by the AR CAG repeat polymorphism. However, the 
      relation between late-onset hypogonadism (LOH) and AR CAG repeat length is 
      unclear and studies of Asian populations are limited. AIM: To investigate the 
      relation between AR CAG repeat length and LOH in Korean men. METHODS: 263 Korean 
      men (mean age = 63.43 +/- 10.9 years) were enrolled from 2014 to 2015. LOH 
      diagnosis was based on a serum testosterone level lower than 3.5 ng/mL and 
      positive androgen deficiency according to the Aging Males' Symptom Scale (AMS). 
      Total testosterone levels and answers to the LOH-related questionnaire were 
      analyzed. OUTCOMES: The relation between AR CAG repeat length and LOH was 
      determined. RESULTS: Mean CAG repeat length was 22.1 +/- 4.6 and mean serum 
      testosterone levels were 2.6 +/- 0.7 and 6.0 +/- 2.0 ng/mL in men with and without 
      LOH, respectively. Men with LOH showed significantly longer AR CAG repeat lengths 
      than men without LOH (26.1 vs 21.6, P < .001). Longer CAG repeat lengths were 
      correlated with higher AMS total scores (r = 0.454, P = .001) and AMS psychotic, 
      somatic, and sexual sub-scores (r = 0.276, 0.246, and 0.571, P = .006, .007, 
      .001, respectively) and significantly lower 5-item International Index of 
      Erectile Function scores (r = -0.261, P = .001). Multivariate analysis showed 
      that patient age and CAG repeat length were independently associated with LOH 
      (odds ratio = 1.05 and 1.29, P = .041 and <.001, respectively). CLINICAL 
      IMPLICATIONS: A longer CAG repeat length is associated with LOH symptoms and LOH. 
      STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: Associations between CAG repeats and LOH were verified 
      in Korean patients. Moreover, a longer CAG repeat length was shown to be an 
      independent risk factor for LOH. Limitations included the small number of LOH 
      patients studied and that other sex hormone-associated factors were not measured. 
      CONCLUSIONS: AR CAG repeat length was associated with LOH prevalence and clinical 
      symptoms in this Korean male population. Thus, it is important to measure CAG 
      repeat length for patients with LOH symptoms with normal testosterone levels. Kim

TI  - A B-Z junction induced by an A ... A mismatch in GAC repeats in the gene for 
      cartilage oligomeric matrix protein promotes binding with the hZalpha(ADAR1) protein.
PG  - 18732-18746
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M117.796235 [doi]
AB  - GAC repeat expansion from five to seven in the exonic region of the gene for 
      cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) leads to pseudoachondroplasia, a 
      skeletal abnormality. However, the molecular mechanism by which GAC expansions in 
      the COMP gene lead to skeletal dysplasias is poorly understood. Here we used 
      molecular dynamics simulations, which indicate that an A ... A mismatch in a 
      d(GAC)(6).d(GAC)(6) duplex induces negative supercoiling, leading to a local 
      B-to-Z DNA transition. This transition facilitates the binding of 
      d(GAC)(7).d(GAC)(7) with the Zalpha-binding domain of human adenosine deaminase 
      acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1, hZalpha(ADAR1)), as confirmed by CD, NMR, and microscale 
      thermophoresis studies. The CD results indicated that hZalpha(ADAR1) recognizes the 
      zigzag backbone of d(GAC)(7).d(GAC)(7) at the B-Z junction and subsequently 
      converts it into Z-DNA via the so-called passive mechanism. Molecular dynamics 
      simulations carried out for the modeled hZalpha(ADAR1)-d(GAC)(6)d(GAC)(6) complex 
      confirmed the retention of previously reported important interactions between the 
      two molecules. These findings suggest that hZalpha(ADAR1) binding with the GAC 
      hairpin stem in COMP can lead to a non-genetic, RNA editing-mediated substitution 
      in COMP that may then play a crucial role in the development of 
      pseudoachondroplasia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Impaired function of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is 
      involved in the pathologic processes of erectile dysfunction (ED), and three 
      functional polymorphisms (G894T, T-786C, and a tandem repeat of 27 bp in intron 
      4) in the NOS3 gene, which encodes eNOS, are associated with the clinical 
      characteristics of ED in several populations. AIM: To investigate the effect of 
      these variations of NOS3 on ED phenotypes and the response to sildenafil in a Han 
      Chinese population. METHODS: This case-control study enrolled 112 patients with 
      ED and 156 age-matched healthy men. Their medical history and laboratory data 
      were collected. ED severity and response to sildenafil were assessed using the 
      five-item International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) score. Routine 
      polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing were used to genotype the three 
      polymorphisms of NOS3. OUTCOMES: The frequencies of alleles, genotypes, and 
      haplotypes of the loci in patients and controls; the IIEF-5 scores of patients 
      carrying the risk and non-risk genotype; and the frequencies of risk and non-risk 
      genotypes in patients with different ages at onset and responses to sildenafil 
      were assessed. RESULTS: The frequencies of drinkers and diabetic and 
      hyperlipidemic patients in the ED group were higher than those in the age-matched 
      control group (P < .05). The distributions of alleles (G894T, P < .005; T-786C, 
      P < .015), genotypes (G894T, P < 0.015; T-786C, P < .010), and haplotypes 
      (G894T/T-786C, P < .015) of the NOS3 polymorphisms were significantly different 
      between patients with ED and controls. An increased risk for earlier onset of ED 
      was observed in the G894T risk genotype carriers (odds ratio = 3.572; P < .020). 
      Patients with the risk genotype of T-786C exhibited lower IIEF-5 scores than 
      patients with the non-risk genotype (8.2 +/- 4.5 vs 12.2 +/- 5.0; P < .015). The 
      influence of the T-786C or G894T genotype on the response to sildenafil was not 
      observed. CLINICAL TRANSLATION: The detectable effect of NOS3 functional 
      polymorphisms on ED suggests their application potential as a molecular biomarker 
      in predicting ED susceptibility and severity in the Han Chinese population. 
      STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: This study provides strong evidence that NOS3 functional 
      variation is an independent risk factor for ED in the Han Chinese population, 
      which should be confirmed in larger cohorts considering the limited number of 
      subjects in this study. CONCLUSION: These results are the first to identify a 
      clear association between NOS3 functional variation and ED susceptibility, age at 
      onset, and severity in the Han Chinese population. Yang B, Liu L, Peng Z, et al.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cell-based therapies involving mononuclear cells (MNCs) have been 
      developed for vascular regeneration to treat ischemic diseases; however, quality 
      control of therapeutic MNCs has not been evaluated. We investigated the 
      therapeutic potential of peripheral blood (PB) MNCs, operated by recently 
      developed quality and quantity (QQ) culture of endothelial progenitor cells 
      (EPCs). METHODS AND RESULTS: PBs were collected from healthy volunteers; 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) isolated from these PBs were 
      subjected to QQ culture for 7 days with medium containing stem cell factor, 
      thrombopoietin, Flt-3 ligand, vascular endothelial growth factor, and 
      interleukin-6. The resulting cells (QQMNCs) in EPC colony-forming assay generated 
      significantly more definitive EPC colonies than PBMNCs. In flow cytometry, 
      macrophages and helper T lymphocytes of QQMNCs became phenotypically polarized 
      into angiogenic, anti-inflammatory, and regenerative subsets: classical M1 to 
      alternative M2; T helper (Th)1 to Th2; angiogenic or regulatory T-cell expansion. 
      Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay revealed the 
      predominant proangiogenic gene expressions in QQMNCs versus PBMNCs. Using murine 
      ischemic hindlimb models, the efficacy of QQMNC intramuscular transplantation 
      (Tx) was compared to that of PBMNCTx, cultured "early EPC" Tx (eEPCTx), and 
      granulocyte colony-stimulating factor mobilized CD34(+) cell Tx (GmCD34Tx). Laser 
      Doppler imaging revealed the blood perfusion recovery in ischemic hindlimbs after 
      QQMNCTx superior to after PBMNCTx and eEPCTx, but also earlier than after 
      GmCD34Tx. Histological evaluations and qRT-PCR assays in ischemic hindlimbs 
      demonstrated that QQMNCTx, similarly to GmCD34Tx, enhanced angiovasculogenesis 
      and myogenesis, whereas it preponderantly inhibited inflammation and fibrosis 
      versus PBMNCTx and eEPCTx. CONCLUSIONS: QQ culture potentiates the ability of 
      PBMNCs to promote regeneration of injured tissue; considering the feasible cell

TI  - Association of interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL1RN) gene polymorphism with 
      recurrent pregnancy loss risk in the North Indian Population and a meta-analysis.

AB  - An appropriate ratio of interleukin 1 beta to interleukin 1 receptor antagonist 
      (IL1Ra) is required for successful pregnancy. Our objective was to study the 
      genetic association between IL1RN variable numbers of tandem repeat (VNTR) 
      polymorphism and recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). To analyze the association 
      between IL1RN VNTR allele and RPL, we investigated the IL1RN VNTR polymorphism in 
      136 RPL patients and in 200 healthy control women. Meta-analysis on this 
      polymorphism was conducted to support our findings. PCR based approach was used 
      to analyze IL1RN VNTR polymorphism and it was further confirmed by sequencing. 
      Systematic review and meta-analysis was done using electronic database (Pub-Med, 
      Google Scholar and Ovid) up to February 27, 2013. This meta-analysis was assessed 
      by comprehensive meta-analysis software version 2. For meta-analysis 549 cases 
      and 1,450 controls were included. The frequency of IL1RN genotype 2/2 was 
      significantly higher in RPL compared to control group (AORs 3.10, 95 % CI 
      1.58-6.11, p = 0.001). The presence of rare allele also increased the risk of RPL 
      significantly (ORs 1.63, 95 % CI 1.16-2.29, p = 0.004). The meta-analysis 
      stratified by ethnicity showed that individuals with allele 2 had increased risk 
      of RPL (OR 1.29, 95 % CI 1.04-1.61, p = 0.01), in Asians population by using 
      fixed model. However the data of the present study clearly suggests that IL1RN 
      VNTR polymorphism is a genetic risk factor for pregnancy loss in the study 
      population.

TI  - Expansion of polyfunctional HIV-specific T cells upon stimulation with mRNA 
      electroporated dendritic cells in the presence of immunomodulatory drugs.
PG  - 9351-60
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00472-12 [doi]
AB  - Recently, it has been demonstrated that disease progression during HIV infection 
      is not determined merely by the number of HIV-specific T cells but also by their 
      quality (J. R. Almeida, et al., J. Exp. Med. 204:2473-2485, 2007; C. T. Berger, 
      et al., J. Virol. 85:9334-9345, 2011; M. R. Betts, et al., Blood 107:4781-4789, 
      2006; V. V. Ganusov, et al., J. Virol. 85:10518-10528, 2011; P. Kiepiela, et al., 
      Nat. Med. 13:46-53, 2007; and F. Pereyra, et al., J. Infect. Dis. 197:563-571, 
      2008). Therefore, strategies to specifically enhance or induce high-quality, 
      HIV-specific T-cell responses are necessary to develop effective immune 
      therapies. Thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide have a strong capacity to 
      boost immune responses and are therefore referred to as immunomodulatory drugs 
      (IMiDs). We evaluated the effects of lenalidomide and pomalidomide on 
      HIV-specific T cells. We found that the presence of IMiDs during in vitro T-cell 
      stimulation with dendritic cells electroporated with Gag- or Nef-encoding mRNA 
      resulted in higher numbers of cytokine-secreting HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells, 
      particularly inducing polyfunctional HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells with an enhanced 
      lytic capacity. Furthermore, CD8(+) T-cell responses were detected upon 
      stimulation with lower antigenic peptide concentrations, and a higher number of 
      Gag epitopes was recognized upon addition of IMiDs. Finally, IMiDs reduced the 
      proliferation of the HIV-specific CD4(+) T cells while increasing the number of 
      polyfunctional CD4(+) T cells. These results provide new information about the 
      effects of IMiDs on antigen-specific T cells and suggest that these drugs 
      increase the efficacy of immune therapies for infectious diseases and cancer.

TI  - Effects of rapid maxillary expansion on middle ear function: one-year follow-up.
PG  - 1184-7
LID - 10.1016/j.ijporl.2012.05.002 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of rapid maxillary expansion (RME) on middle 
      ear function before, after, 3 months and one year from expansion procedure. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighteen patients with mean age of 8.1 years (+/-3.7) and 
      posterior cross-bite were followed from pre expansion to one year after RME, 
      regarding their hearing quality and middle ear function. Nine of them presented 
      middle ear dysfunction (MED) and nine presented normal function (NF) before rapid 
      maxillary expansion. Audiometric and tympanometric exams were taken before rapid 
      maxillary expansion, after RME (15 days), 3 months and one year after rapid 
      maxillary expansion. RESULTS: Among those in the MED group, no patient had 
      acoustic reflex (AR) before rapid maxillary expansion; 67% presented type C 
      tympanometric curve, 22% had type A and 11% had As type tympanometric curve. One 
      year after rapid maxillary expansion, all patients presented AR and showed type A 
      tympanometric curves. In NF group, all patients showed AR and type A 
      tympanometric curves in all records. In both groups no audiograms presented 
      significant variations along study. CONCLUSION: Rapid maxillary expansion has no 
      deleterious effect in hearing quality and seems to improve middle ear function in 
      children with posterior cross-bite in a one-year perspective.

TI  - Indexing disease progression at study entry with individuals at-risk for 
      Huntington disease.
PG  - 751-63
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.b.31232 [doi]
AB  - The identification of clinical and biological markers of disease in persons at 
      risk for Huntington disease (HD) has increased in efforts to better quantify and 
      characterize the epoch of prodrome prior to clinical diagnosis. Such efforts are 
      critical in the design and implementation of clinical trials for HD so that 
      interventions can occur at a time most likely to increase neuronal survival and 
      maximize daily functioning. A prime consideration in the examination of prodromal 
      individuals is their proximity to diagnosis. It is necessary to quantify 
      proximity so that individual differences in key marker variables can be properly 
      interpreted. We take a data-driven approach to develop an index that can be 
      viewed as a proxy for time to HD diagnosis known as the CAG-Age Product Scaled or 
      CAP(S) . CAP(S) is an observed utility variable computed for all genetically 
      at-risk individuals based on age at study entry and CAG repeat length. Results of 
      a longitudinal receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that 
      CAP(S) had a relatively strong ability to predict individuals who became 
      diagnosed, especially in the first 2 years. Bootstrap validation provided 
      evidence that CAP(S) computed on a new sample from the same population could have 
      similar discriminatory power. Cutoffs for the empirical CAP(S) distribution can 
      be used to create a classification for mutation-positive individuals 
      (Low-Med-High), which is, useful for comparison with the naturally occurring 
      mutation-negative Control group. The classification is an improvement over the 
      one currently in use as it is based on observed data rather than model-based 
      estimated values. (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

      by disproportionate short stature, joint laxity, and early onset osteoarthrosis. 
      Pseudoachondroplasia is caused by mutations in the gene encoding cartilage 
      oligomeric matrix protein (COMP). We looked for mutations in the COMP gene in 
      three sporadic Chinese pseudoachondroplasia patients and identified two novel 
      mutations, c.1189G>T (p.D397Y) and c.1220G>A (p.C407Y), and one recurrent 
      mutation, c.1318G>C (p.G440R), in the calcium binding type III repeats of COMP. 
      This study confirms the relationship between mutations of the COMP gene and 
      clinical findings of pseudoachondroplasia; it also provides evidence for the 
      importance of the calcium binding domains to the functioning of COMP.

AB  - The polyglutamine diseases are caused in part by a gain-of-function mechanism of 
      neuronal toxicity involving protein conformational changes that result in the 
      formation and deposition of beta-sheet rich aggregates. Recent evidence suggests 
      that the misfolding mechanism is context-dependent, and that properties of the 
      host protein, including the domain architecture and location of the repeat tract, 
      can modulate aggregation. In order to allow the bioinformatic investigation of 
      the context of polyglutamines, we have constructed a database, PolyQ 
      (http://pxgrid.med.monash.edu.au/polyq). We have collected the sequences of all 
      human proteins containing runs of seven or more glutamine residues and annotated 
      their sequences with domain information. PolyQ can be interrogated such that the 
      sequence context of polyglutamine repeats in disease and non-disease associated 
      proteins can be investigated.

TI  - In vivo expansion of naive and activated CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory T cell 
      populations in interleukin-2-treated HIV patients.
PG  - 10632-7

AB  - HIV-1 infection is characterized by a progressive decline in CD4(+) T cells 
      leading to a state of profound immunodeficiency. IL-2 therapy has been shown to 
      improve CD4(+) counts beyond that observed with antiretroviral therapy. Recent 
      phase III trials revealed that despite a sustained increase in CD4(+) counts, 
      IL-2-treated patients did not experience a better clinical outcome [Abrams D, et 
      al. (2009) N Engl J Med 361(16):1548-1559]. To explain these disappointing 
      results, we have studied phenotypic, functional, and molecular characteristics of 
      CD4(+) T cell populations in IL-2-treated patients. We found that the principal 
      effect of long-term IL-2 therapy was the expansion of two distinct CD4(+)CD25(+) 
      T cell populations (CD4(+)CD25(lo)CD127(lo)FOXP3(+) and 
      CD4(+)CD25(hi)CD127(lo)FOXP3(hi)) that shared phenotypic markers of Treg but 
      could be distinguished by the levels of CD25 and FOXP3 expression. IL-2-expanded 
      CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells suppressed proliferation of effector cells in vitro and had 
      gene expression profiles similar to those of natural regulatory 
      CD4(+)CD25(hi)FOXP3(+) T cells (Treg) from healthy donors, an immunosuppressive T 
      cell subset critically important for the maintenance of self-tolerance. We 
      propose that the sustained increase of the peripheral Treg pool in IL-2-treated 
      HIV patients may account for the unexpected clinical observation that patients 
      with the greatest expansion of CD4(+) T cells had a higher relative risk of 
      clinical progression to AIDS.

AB  - The expansion of DNA repeat sequences is associated with many genetic diseases in 
      humans. Simple bulge DNA structures have been implicated as intermediates in DNA 
      slippage within the DNA repeat regions. To probe the possible role of bulged 
      structures in DNA slippage, we designed and synthesized a pair of simple chiral 
      spirocyclic compounds [Xi Z, Ouyang D & Mu HT (2006) Bioorg Med Chem Lett 16, 
      1180-1184], DDI-1A and DDI-1B, which mimic the molecular architecture of the 
      enediyne antitumor antibiotic neocarzinostatin chromophore. Both compounds 
      strongly stimulated slippage in various DNA repeats in vitro. Enhanced slippage 
      synthesis was found to be synchronous for primer and template. CD spectra and UV 
      thermal stability studies supported the idea that DDI-1A and DDI-1B exhibited 
      selective binding to the DNA bulge and induced a significant conformational 
      change in bulge DNA. The proposed mechanism for the observed in vitro expansion 
      of long DNA is discussed.

AB  - Cerebellar granule cell precursors (GCPs), which give rise to the most abundant 
      neuronal type in the mammalian brain, arise from a restricted pool of primary 
      progenitors in the rhombic lip (RL). Sonic hedgehog (Shh) secreted by developing 
      Purkinje cells is essential for the expansion of GCPs and for cerebellar 
      morphogenesis. Recent studies have shown that the primary cilium concentrates 
      components of Shh signaling and that this structure is required for Shh 
      signaling. GCPs have a primary cilium on their surface [Del Cerro, M.P., Snider, 
      R.S. (1972). Studies on the developing cerebellum. II. The ultrastructure of the 
      external granular layer. J Comp Neurol 144, 131-64.]. Here, we show that 1) this 
      cilium can be conditionally ablated by crossing Kif3a(fl/-) mice with hGFAP-Cre 
      mice, 2) removal of Kif3a from GCPs disrupts cerebellar development, and 3) these 
      defects are due to a drastic reduction in Shh-dependent expansion of GCPs. A 
      similar phenotype is observed when Smoothened (Smo), an essential transducer of 
      Shh signaling, is removed from the same population of GCPs. Interestingly, 
      Kif3a-Smo double conditional mutants show that Kif3a is epistatic to Smo. This 
      work shows that Kif3a is essential for Shh-dependent expansion of cerebellar 
      progenitors. Dysfunctional cilia are associated with diverse human disorders 
      including Bardet-Biedl and Joubert syndromes. Cerebellar abnormalities observed 
      in these patients could be explained by defects in Shh-induced GCP expansion.

PG  - 1533-41
AB  - It has been recently shown (Seddiki, N., B. Santner-Nanan, J. Martinson, J. 
      Zaunders, S. Sasson, A. Landay, M. Solomon, W. Selby, S.I. Alexander, R. Nanan, 
      et al. 2006. J. Exp. Med. 203:1693-1700.) that the expression of interleukin (IL) 
      7 receptor (R) alpha discriminates between two distinct CD4 T cell populations, 
      both characterized by the expression of CD25, i.e. CD4 regulatory T (T reg) cells 
      and activated CD4 T cells. T reg cells express low levels of IL-7Ralpha, whereas 
      activated CD4 T cells are characterized by the expression of IL-7Ralpha(high). We 
      have investigated the distribution of these two CD4 T cell populations in 36 
      subjects after liver and kidney transplantation and in 45 healthy subjects. 
      According to a previous study (Demirkiran, A., A. Kok, J. Kwekkeboom, H.J. 
      Metselaar, H.W. Tilanus, and L.J. van der Laan. 2005. Transplant. Proc. 
      37:1194-1196.), we observed that the T reg CD25(+)CD45RO(+)IL-7Ralpha(low) cell 
      population was reduced in transplant recipients (P < 0.00001). Interestingly, the 
      CD4(+)CD25(+)CD45RO(+)IL-7Ralpha(high) cell population was significantly 
      increased in stable transplant recipients compared with healthy subjects (P < 
      0.00001), and the expansion of this cell population was even greater in patients 
      with documented humoral chronic rejection compared with stable transplant 
      recipients (P < 0.0001). The expanded CD4(+)CD25(+)CD45RO(+)IL-7Ralpha(high) cell 
      population contained allospecific CD4 T cells and secreted effector cytokines 
      such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma, thus potentially 
      contributing to the mechanisms of chronic rejection. More importantly, 
      CD4(+)IL-7Ralpha(+)and CD25(+)IL-7Ralpha(+) cells were part of the T cell 
      population infiltrating the allograft of patients with a documented diagnosis of 
      chronic humoral rejection. These results indicate that the 
      CD4(+)CD25(+)IL-7Ralpha(+) cell population may represent a valuable, sensitive, 
      and specific marker to monitor allospecific CD4 T cell responses both in blood 
      and in tissues after organ transplantation.

TI  - Efficient priming and expansion of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells by a novel 
      cell-based artificial APC.
PG  - 512-21
AB  - The ex vivo priming and expansion of human CTL by APC, such as autologous 
      monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC), has the potential for use in immunotherapy 
      for infectious diseases and cancer. To overcome the difficulty of obtaining 
      sufficient number of autologous DC from patients, we have developed cell-based 
      artificial APC (aAPC), designated Med-APC. These aAPC rapidly activate and expand 
      the corresponding Ag-specific CD8+ T cells when pulsed with CTL epitope 
      peptide(s) as efficiently as mature DC (mDC). We have also shown that Med-APC 
      possess an innate cellular machinery that is sufficient to support the processing 
      of complete Ag into immunodominant peptides, which considerably extends the 
      usefulness of this technology. In addition, we have developed a novel expression 
      vector system that expresses ubiquitinated Ag, resulting in an enhanced APC 
      function of this system. Genetically encoded Ag can be easily introduced into 
      Med-APC by transfection with this vector. Med-APC transfected with ubiquitinated 
      Ag can efficiently expand the corresponding Ag-specific CTL without exogenous 
      peptides. Therefore, Med-APC may have important therapeutic implications for 
      adoptive immunotherapy and can be used for the detection of Ag-specific CTL for 
      immunomonitoring.

TI  - Frequency-place compression and expansion in cochlear implant listeners.
PG  - 3130-40
AB  - In multichannel cochlear implants, low frequency information is delivered to 
      apical cochlear locations while high frequency information is delivered to more 
      basal locations, mimicking the normal acoustic tonotopic organization of the 
      auditory nerves. In clinical practice, little attention has been paid to the 
      distribution of acoustic input across the electrodes of an individual patient 
      that might vary in terms of spacing and absolute tonotopic location. In 
      normal-hearing listeners, Baskent and Shannon (J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 113, 2003) 
      simulated implant signal processing conditions in which the frequency range 
      assigned to the array was systematically made wider or narrower than the 
      simulated stimulation range in the cochlea, resulting in frequency-place 
      compression or expansion, respectively. In general, the best speech recognition 
      was obtained when the input acoustic information was delivered to the matching 
      tonotopic place in the cochlea with least frequency-place distortion. The present 
      study measured phoneme and sentence recognition scores with similar 
      frequency-place manipulations in six Med-El Combi 40+ implant subjects. 
      Stimulation locations were estimated using the Greenwood mapping function based 
      on the estimated electrode insertion depth. Results from frequency-place 
      compression and expansion with implants were similar to simulation results, 
      especially for postlingually deafened subjects, despite the uncertainty in the 
      actual stimulation sites of the auditory nerves. The present study shows that 
      frequency-place mapping is an important factor in implant performance and an 
      individual implant patient's map could be optimized with functional tests using 
      frequency-place manipulations.

TI  - Structure of a thrombospondin C-terminal fragment reveals a novel calcium core in 
      the type 3 repeats.
PG  - 1223-33
AB  - Thrombospondins (TSPs) are extracellular regulators of cell-matrix interactions 
      and cell phenotype. The most highly conserved region of all TSPs are the 
      calcium-binding type 3 (T3) repeats and the C-terminal globular domain (CTD). The 
      crystal structure of a cell-binding TSP-1 fragment, spanning three T3 repeats and 
      the CTD, reveals a compact assembly. The T3 repeats lack secondary structure and 
      are organised around a core of calcium ions; two DxDxDGxxDxxD motifs per repeat 
      each encapsulate two calcium ions in a novel arrangement. The CTD forms a 
      lectin-like beta-sandwich and contains four strictly conserved calcium-binding 
      sites. Disruption of the hairpin structure of T3 repeats 6 and 7 decreases 
      protein secretion and stability. The availability for cell attachment of an RGD 
      motif in T3 repeat 7 is modulated by calcium loading. The central architectural 
      role of calcium explains how it is critical for the functions of the TSP 
      C-terminal region. Mutations in the T3 repeats of TSP-5/COMP, which cause two 
      human skeletal disorders, are predicted to disrupt the tertiary structure of the 
      T3-CTD assembly.

TI  - Does chromosome 22 have anything to do with sex determination: further studies on 
      a 46,XX,22q11.2 del male.
PG  - 64-7
AB  - Several years ago, we presented a patient with true hermaphroditism and partial 
      duplication of chromosome 22 and no evidence of SRY (Aleck et al. [1999: Am J Med 
      Genet 85:2-4]). Recently a 46,XX male with velocardiofacial syndrome and a 
      deletion of 22q11.2 and no evidence of Y chromosomal loci in blood DNA was 
      reported (Phelan et al. [2003: Am J Med Genet 116A:77-79]). We have restudied 
      this patient as he enters puberty. Because chromosomal deletions sometimes 
      involve micro rearrangements of nearby material, we have extensively studied this 
      individual's chromosome 22 looking for evidence of any gene duplication. We 
      studied a number of variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) loci along chromosome 22 
      in the patient and both parents. Normal Mendelian inheritance of the VNTRs was 
      found. We then used quantitative multiplex PCR of short fluorescent fragments 
      (QMPSF) to delineate the 22q11.2 deletion in this patient (Jacquet et al. [2002: 
      Hum Molec Genet 11:2243-2249]) and found a pattern of deletion typical of the 
      velocardiofacial DiGeorge syndrome. Finally, the patient's DNA has been analyzed 
      using a full coverage human chromosome 22 genomic microarray (array comparative 
      genomic hybridization [CGH]) for evidence of rearrangements outside the classical 
      velocardiofacial DiGeorge associated deletion (Buckley et al. [2002: Hum Molec 
      Genet 11:3221-3229]). The array-CGH profile of this patient confirms the deletion 
      encompassing the typically deleted region associated with the velocardiofacial 
      DiGeorge syndrome and provides no support for additional gene copy number 
      aberrations on 22q. Thus, there is no evidence of any chromosome 22 trisomic 
      material. In this case, the rare events of sex reversal and 22q11.2 deletion may 
      have occurred together by chance.

      oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) gene: further expansion of the phenotypic 
      variations of COMP defects.
PG  - 730-7
AB  - We report on a Japanese family of four generations with an autosomal dominant 
      precocious osteoarthropathy. The cardinal clinical manifestations of affected 
      individuals were painful weight-bearing large joints, which started in late 
      childhood or adolescence. The radiological hallmarks included coxa plana, mild 
      epiphyseal dysplasia of the knee, and round talar domes with tibiotalar slant in 
      childhood, which evolved into degenerative joint diseases in adulthood. The 
      disease phenotype was cosegregated with a mutation of the cartilage oligomeric 
      matrix protein (COMP) gene in the family members, who underwent molecular 
      evaluation. COMP mutations have been reported in a mild form of multiple 
      epiphyseal dysplasia (MED), Ribbing type, as well as allied disorders with more 
      severe manifestations, such as MED Fairbank type and pseudoachondroplasia. Unlike 
      previously reported cases with the Ribbing type, the present patients did not 
      have short stature or brachydactyly. This report expands further the phenotypic 
      variations of COMP defects.

TI  - A novel protocol that allows short-term stem cell expansion of both committed and 
      pluripotent hematopoietic progenitor cells suitable for clinical use.
PG  - 715-24; discussion 725-7
AB  - To obtain long-term engraftment and hematopoiesis in myeloablated patients, the 
      cell population used for hematopoietic reconstitution should include a sufficient 
      number of early pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), along with committed 
      cells from the various lineages. For this purpose, the small subset of CD34+ 
      cells purified from different sources must be expanded ex vivo. Since cytokines 
      may induce both proliferation and differentiation, expansion would provide a cell 
      population comprising committed as well as uncommitted cells. Optimization of HSC 
      expansion methods could be obtained by a combination of cytokines able to sustain 
      renewal of pluripotent cells yet endowed with poor differentiation potential. We 
      used variations of the combinations of cytokines described by Brugger et al. [W. 
      Brugger, S. Heimfels, R. J. Berenson, R. Mertelsmann, and L. Kanz (1995) N. Engl. 
      J. Med. 333, 283-287] and Piacibello et al. [W. Piacibello, F. Sanavio, L. 
      Garetto, A. Severino, D. Bergandi, J. Ferrario, F. Fagioli, M. Berger, and M. 
      Aglietta (1997) Blood 89, 2644-2653] to expand UCB CD34+ cells and monitored 
      proliferation rate and phenotype after 14 days of culture. Several hematopoietic 
      lineage-associated surface antigens were evaluated. Our data show that flt3L and 
      thrombopoietin in combination with IL-3, while sustaining a high CD34+ 
      proliferation rate, provide a relatively low enrichment in very early uncommitted 
      CD34+/CD38- cells. Conversely, in the absence of IL-3, they are less effective in 
      inducing proliferation yet significantly increase the number of CD34+/CD38- 
      cells. A combination of the above protocols, applied simultaneously to aliquots 
      of the same sample, would allow expansion of both committed and pluripotent HSC. 
      This strategy may represent a significant improvement for clinical applications.

TI  - Detection of expansion regions in Portuguese bipolar families.
PG  - 854-7
AB  - We have studied 24 families with multiple affected members with bipolar disorder 
      to test the hypothesis that in those families clinically showing genetic 
      anticipation [Macedo et al., 1999] we would find large repeat expansions. The 
      families meeting inclusion criteria had a minimum of two affected members over 
      two generations and showed marked anticipation both in terms of age of onset and 
      disease severity. We used the repeat expansion detection (RED) method to test 
      patients (n = 24) and controls from these families and unrelated controls (n = 
      53). We also genotyped patients and family members from two families with large 
      expansions at the known expansion loci on chromosomes 13, 17, and 18. The RED 
      method revealed a higher number of large expansions in patients compared with 
      controls (t-test; P < 0.0055: Mann-Whitney U; P = 0.02). The patients with the 
      largest expansions were typed at the specific loci on chromosomes 13, 17, and 18 
      and the chromosome 18 expansion locus segregated with disease in one family, and 
      a second family showed segregation with the expansion located at the SCA8 locus 
      on chromosome 13. Genetic anticipation had been analyzed in this cohort of 
      families, with correction for potential ascertainment bias, possible proband 
      effects, cohort effects, regression to the mean, gender effects, and maternal vs. 
      paternal transmission. None of these potential confounds appeared to account for 
      the observed anticipation. We also identified that the presence of large 
      expansions in affected family members derives primarily from two families from 
      the genetically isolated Azores population. One family shows segregation with the 
      chromosome 18 locus, whereas the other family segregates with expansions at the 
      SCA8 locus. Am. J. Med. Genet. (Neuropsychiatr. Genet.) 96:854-857, 2000.

TI  - Association analysis of CAG repeats at the KCNN3 locus in Indian patients with 
      bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.
PG  - 744-8
AB  - Bipolar affective disorder and schizophrenia are severe behavioral disorders with 
      a lifetime risk of approximately 1% in the population worldwide. There is 
      evidence that these diseases may manifest the phenomenon of anticipation similar 
      to that seen in diseases caused by trinucleotide repeat expansions. A recent 
      report has implicated a potassium channel-coding gene, KCNN3, which contains a 
      polymorphic CAG repeat in its coding region, in schizophrenia and bipolar 
      disorder. We have tried to confirm these findings in Indian patients suffering 
      from bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. No statistically significant evidence 
      for the presence of an excess of longer alleles in the patient population, as 
      compared to ethnically matched controls, was found. However, an analysis of the 
      difference of allele sizes revealed a significantly greater number of patients 
      with schizophrenia having differences of allele sizes > or = 5 when compared to 
      normal controls. This finding may be of functional significance as the KCNN3 
      protein is thought to act as a tetramer, and a large difference in allele sizes 
      would result in an asymmetric molecule with a different number of glutamine 
      residues in each monomer. Am. J. Med. Genet. (Neuropsychiatr. Genet.) 96:744-748,

TI  - Association analysis of 5HT transporter gene in bipolar disorder in the Indian 
      population.
PG  - 170-2
AB  - A variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism consisting of multiple copies 
      of a 17-bp repeat in the second intron of the serotonin transporter gene (SERT) 
      has been reported. Different alleles of this VNTR have been found to be 
      associated with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. These findings have been 
      confirmed in some populations, but disconfirmed in others. Furthermore, 
      significant ethnic variations in the distribution of these alleles both in normal 
      and patient populations also have been reported. We analyzed the VNTR 
      polymorphism in 50 Indian patients with bipolar disorder and in ethnically 
      matched controls. Two alleles corresponding to 10 and 12 repeats of the VNTR were 
      found in both groups. There were no significant differences either in allele 
      frequency or genotype frequency between the two groups. The nine-repeat allele 
      that has been reported in Japanese and Caucasian populations was absent in our 
      sample. Although it will be important to extend the present study in a larger 
      sample, our initial results do not suggest any large association with alleles of 
      the VNTR in the SERT gene and bipolar disorder in Indian patients. Am. J. Med.

TI  - Genetic associations with clinical characteristics in bipolar affective disorder 
      and recurrent unipolar depressive disorder.
PG  - 36-42
AB  - Genetic factors may be associated with disease subtype as well as susceptibility. 
      We have therefore typed polymorphisms at the serotonin transporter, dopamine 
      receptor, tryptophan hydroxylase, tyrosine hydoxylase, and monoamine oxidase A 
      (MAOA) loci in 139 unipolar and 131 bipolar patients and investigated 
      associations with gender, number of episodes, age of onset, history of psychotic 
      symptoms, history of suicidal behavior, and history of substance abuse. In 
      bipolar subjects, the promoter variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) allele 132 of 
      MAOA was associated with history of suicide attempts, P = 0.029, particularly in 
      females, P = 0.006. The Fnu4HI allele 1 of MAOA was also associated with history 
      of suicide attempts in females, P = 0.0162. The serotonin transporter promoter 
      allele 2 was associated with increasing number of manic episodes, P = 0.02, and 
      history of psychotic symptoms, P = 0.0243. One significant association was found 
      in the unipolar group: dopamine D2 receptor promoter allele 2 with history of 
      psychotic symptoms, P = 0. 0165. We have tested multiple loci for a variety of 
      different clinical variables and performed 228 tests of significance in total. It 
      is possible that these preliminary findings are type 1 errors, because one would 
      expect 11 of the 228 tests to reach a nominal significance level of P < 0.05 by 
      chance alone if all the tests were independent. The associations with the MAOA 
      and serotonin transporter loci are consistent with previous data suggesting 
      associations with susceptibility to bipolar affective disorder. Am. J. Med.

TI  - Analysis of ERDA1, CTG18.1, and uncloned CAG/CTG repeat sequences in familial 
      Parkinson's disease with anticipation.
PG  - 738-41
AB  - In several neurodegenerative diseases, anticipation or increase in disease 
      severity in succeeding generations within families correlates with expansions of 
      an intragenic CAG/CTG repeat sequence above the normal range through the 
      generations of a pedigree. Some kindreds of familial Parkinson's disease (PD) 
      exhibit genetic anticipation. We used the repeat expansion detection (RED) method 
      to detect repeat expansions directly in DNA samples from the index cases of 34 
      different PD families with anticipation. The mean age at onset of the younger 
      probands was 48.8 +/- 10.8 years and the mean intergenerational difference was 
      19.2 +/- 10 years. The distribution of the RED products greater than 40 repeats 
      was not significantly different between patients and controls with the 
      Mann-Whitney U test (U = 510.5, p = 0.67). The samples were then screened for the 
      two expanded-repeat loci, ERDA1 and CTG18.1. We found that in all cases the 
      repeat expansion detected by the RED method may be accounted for by an expansion 
      at these loci. Our results demonstrate that unstable CAG/CTG expansions 
      corresponding to uncloned or cloned sequences (ERDA1, CTG18.1) are not involved 
      in the etiology of rare familial case of PD with genetic anticipation. Am. J.

TI  - Homicidal behavior in schizophrenia associated with a genetic polymorphism 
      determining low catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) activity.
PG  - 628-33
AB  - Although aggressive, violent, and dangerous behavior in man has multifactorial 
      causes, genetic factors are estimated by twin and adoption studies to 
      substantially contribute to the development of such conduct. Recently, 
      homozygosity of a low enzyme activity variant of the catechol O-methyltransferase 
      (COMT) gene was reported to be associated with aggressive behavior in a group of 
      schizophrenic patients. We observe a similar tendency in a group of 30 
      schizophrenic patients who were confined to a maximum-security psychiatric 
      facility for homicide. Significant excess (46.7% versus 21.0%) homozygosity of 
      the low activity COMTmet/met genotype was observed in 30 mostly male (28 of 30) 
      homicidal schizophrenic patients compared with 415 control subjects (Pearson 
      chi(2) = 10.53, P = 0.005, df = 2). No difference in COMT genotype was found 
      between 62 nonviolent schizophrenic patients and the 415 control subjects (chi(2) 
      = 0.963, P > 0.1, df = 2). A trend for excess (46.7% versus 25.8%) homozygosity 
      of the low activity COMTmet/met genotype was also observed when the homicidal 
      schizophrenic subjects were compared directly with the nonviolent schizophrenic 
      patients (chi(2) = 4.03, P = 0.1, df = 2). Similarly, an excess of the low 
      activity COMTmet allele was observed in homicidal versus nonviolent schizophrenic 
      patients (chi(2) = 2.92, P = 0.087, df = 2). Similar results were obtained if 
      only male subjects were examined. No significant difference was found between 
      control (257 Ashkenazi and 152 non-Ashkenazi Jews) COMT genotypes in the two 
      principal ethnic groups examined (chi(2) = 3.79, P > 0.1, df = 2). Finally, no 
      association was observed between homicidal behavior in schizophrenic patients and 
      the dopamine D4 exon III repeat length polymorphism (D4DR) and the serotonin 
      transporter promoter-region polymorphism (5-HTTLPR). Am. J. Med. Genet.

TI  - Trinucleotide expansion mutations in the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein 
      (COMP) gene.
PG  - 123-8
AB  - Pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH) and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED) are two 
      human autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasias characterized by variable short 
      stature, joint laxity and early-onset degenerative joint disease. Both disorders 
      can result from mut-ations in the gene for cartilage oligomeric matrix protein 
      (COMP), an extracellular matrix glycoprotein. About one-third of PSACH cases 
      result from heterozygosity for deletion of one codon within a very short triplet 
      repeat, (GAC)5, which encodes five consecutive aspartic acid residues within the 
      calmodulin-like region of the COMP protein. We have identified two expansion 
      mut-ations in this repeat: an MED patient carrying a (GAC)6allele and a PSACH 
      patient carrying a (GAC)7allele. These are among the shortest disease-causing 
      triplet repeat expansion mutations described thus far, and are the first 
      identified in a GAC repeat. A unique feature of this sequence is that expansion 
      as well as shortening of the repeat can cause the same disease. In cartilage, 
      both patients have rough endoplasmic reticulum inclusions in chondrocytes. The 
      inclusions are also present in tendon tissue and can be reproduced in cultured 
      tendon cells, suggesting that the pathophysiology of disease is similar in both 
      cartilage and tendon.

TI  - Human adenylyl cyclase type 7 contains polymorphic repeats in the 3' untranslated 
      region: investigations of association with alcoholism.
PG  - 95-8
AB  - Platelet adenylyl cyclase activity has been proposed as a trait marker for 
      alcoholism [Tabakoff et al. (1988): N Engl J Med 318:134-13;9; Parsian et al. 
      (1996): Alcohol Clin Exp Res 20:745-751]. Human adenylyl cyclase type 7 (ADCY7) 
      is a member of the adenylyl cyclase gene family, and it may be the major form of 
      adenylyl cyclase expressed in human platelets. The published cDNA sequence of 
      ADCY7 indicated the presence of potentially polymorphic regions in the 3' 
      untranslated region of ADCY7. PCR techniques combined with fluorescently labeled 
      primers were used to amplify two separate tetranucleotide repeat regions 
      [(AACA)n] in the 3' untranslated region of ADCY7 from the genomic DNA of 62 
      unrelated individuals. The upstream (AACA)4-repeat was not polymorphic. Five 
      different genotypes were found in the downstream (AACA)5-7 tetranucleotide repeat 
      region. We also tested the association of the tetranucleotide polymorphism to 
      alcohol dependence. When 30 alcoholic and 17 control individuals were compared, 
      no difference was found in the ADCY7 tetranucleotide polymorphism between 
      alcohol-dependent and control groups. Nevertheless, to our knowledge these are 
      the first polymorphisms reported in an adenylyl cyclase gene. Adenylyl cyclases 
      are important receptor-G protein-coupled effectors and are involved in numerous 
      neuronal functions in the central nervous system. Whether variations in ADCY7 and 
      possible variations in other members of this gene family are underlying other 
      psychiatric disorders remains to be studied.

TI  - Anophthalmia, intracerebral cysts, and cleft lip/palate: expansion of the

PG  - 39-42
AB  - We report on a patient with multiple congenital anomalies including anophthalmia, 
      cleft lip and palate, and central nervous system anomalies similar to the case 
      reported by Leichtman et al. [1994: Am J Med Genet 50:39-41] and to 
      oculocerebrocutaneous (Delleman) syndrome. Although the two cases and those with 
      oculocerebrocutaneous syndrome may represent separate but overlapping entities, 
      our patient and the case described by Leichtman et al. [1994: Am J Med Genet 
      50:39-41] may represent a more severe form of oculocerebrocutaneous syndrome.

TI  - Inability to induce fragile sites at CTG repeats in congenital myotonic 
      dystrophy.
PG  - 60-3
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is a trinucleotide repeat syndrome which can contain 50 
      to over 2,000 CTG repeats in affected individuals, but does not express a fragile 
      site. Although one prior study [Jalal et al., Am J Med Genet 46:441-443, 1993] 
      did not find evidence of fragility at 19q13.3 in six individuals affected with DM 
      using induction protocols for folate sensitive fragile sites, other chemicals may 
      induce fragile site expression at this site. In an attempt to induce fragile 
      sites at 19q13.3, blood cultures from four congenital DM cases and four control 
      individuals treated with fluorodeoxyuridine (folate-sensitive rare fragile 
      sites), bromodeoxyurdine (rare and common fragile sites), aphidicolin (common 
      fragile sites), and 5-azacytidine (common fragile sites) were harvested using 
      routine cytogenetic technique. Slides were solid stained and 100 cells were 
      examined for fragile site expression, particularly on F group chromosomes. The 
      latter were photographed prior to destaining and G-banded to verify chromosome 
      and band location of breakage. No culture conditions induced a fragile site at 
      band 19q13.3 at > 1% expression in patients with congenital DM. Our results 
      suggest that CTG repeats, even when present in > 1,000 copies, may behave 
      differently from other large expansions which are associated with fragile sites. 
      The CTG repeats in DM are not associated with a methylated CpG island, as are 
      folate-sensitive fragile sites, which most likely plays a role in the expression 
      of fragile sites at the trinucleotide repetitive site.

TI  - Light maxillary expansion forces with the magnetic expansion device. A 
      preliminary investigation.
PG  - 479-90
AB  - An active maxillary magnetic expansion device (MED) was developed to be used 
      clinically. The aim was to show the effects of light and continuous forces 
      producing less traumatic stimulation of maxillary sutural growth than a 
      conventional rapid maxillary expansion device. In this study, two different types 
      of appliances were used on six patients between 7 years 4 months and 16 years 2 
      months: the first type was bonded, the other one used bands. For better 
      appreciation, four implants were placed on each patient: two apically between 
      central and lateral incisors, and two between second premolars and molars. A 
      standardized radiographic technique was used to take occlusal radiographs, and 
      postero-anterior and lateral headplates. The results varied according to the age 
      and the appliance used. The skeletal effect with the banded MED was between 16 
      and 77 per cent, and for the bonded MED 0 and 25 per cent in comparison to the 
      overall expansion. It seems that 250-500 g of continuous magnetic forces can 
      produce dental and skeletal movements in a light force expansion concept, but 
      further studies with larger samples are needed to make firm conclusions.

TI  - Enzymatic amplification of mini-exon-derived RNA gene spacers of Leishmania 
      donovani: primers and probes for DNA diagnosis.
PG  - 509-17
AB  - The multicopy mini-exon-derived RNA (med RNA) locus of Leishmania donovani was 
      enzymatically amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The major 180 bp 
      PCR product contained conserved med RNA gene sequences flanking the variable 
      intergenic spacer from the med RNA gene tandem repeat. The oligonucleotide 
      primers cross-reacted with other Leishmania species. In serial dilution 
      experiments, positivity in the PCR assay was observed down to the genomic DNA 
      equivalent of less than a single Leishmania cell. When the major PCR products 
      from Indian L. donovani isolates were cloned and used as probes in dot 
      hybridization analyses, they discriminated between L. donovani and L. 
      amazonensis, L. major and L. infantum under high stringency conditions. DNA from 
      spleen biopsies and blood samples of confirmed kala azar patients was positive, 
      as were two skin biopsies from patients with post-kala azar dermal leishmaniasis 
      (PKDL). These observations demonstrate that PCR amplification of med RNA 
      intergenic spacers is sufficiently sensitive for clinical diagnosis of kala azar 
      and PKDL, and furthermore, that cloned intergenic spacer probes may be useful for 
      identification and classification of L. donovani.

TI  - In vitro expansion and analysis of T lymphocyte microcultures obtained from the 
      vaccination sites of cancer patients undergoing active specific immunization with 
      autologous Newcastle-disease-virus-modified tumour cells.
PG  - 240-4
AB  - In order to understand further the effects of 
      Newcastle-disease-virus(NDV)-modified tumour vaccines we investigated the 
      feasibility of isolating lymphocytes from the site of injection of patients 
      undergoing postoperative active specific immunization (ASI) with autologous 
      NDV-modified tumour cells. Delayed-type-hypersensitivity(DTH)-like reactions from 
      five cancer patients were surgically removed, minced and the tissue particles 
      were digested with collagenase and DNase. Lymphoid cells recovered were expanded 
      in a highly efficient limiting-dilution analysis system optimized for T cell 
      growth [Moretta et al. (1983) J Exp Med 157: 743] and lymphocyte microcultures 
      (clonal probability > 0.8) could be grown for up to 1 year. Analysis of the 
      microcultures for phenotype and function showed that the majority were positive 
      for CD4 (92%) and TCR alpha beta (96%). Concanavalin-A-induced production of 
      interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-6, interferon gamma and tumour necrosis factor alpha was 
      detected in more than 70% of the microcultures. Lectin-dependent cytotoxicity was 
      only very rarely observed. The general characteristics of the microcultures 
      obtained support the notion of a DTH-like reaction taking place at the site of 
      tumour cell challenge. The possibility of in vitro expansion and cultivation of T 
      lymphocytes from ASI vaccination sites should help to elucidate further the role 
      of these cells in active specific immunization against autologous tumour cells.

TI  - Optimization of culture conditions for activation and large-scale expansion of 
      human T lymphocytes for bispecific antibody-directed cellular immunotherapy.
PG  - 973-9
AB  - We investigated the optimal culture conditions (i.e., activation procedure, 
      medium composition and type of culture vessel) for rapid in vitro expansion of 
      large numbers (greater than 5 x 10(9) of blood T lymphocytes. These expanded 
      lymphocytes can be targeted to be cytotoxic to ovarian carcinoma cells with a 
      bispecific monoclonal antibody (BsAb) specific for CD3 and for the ovarian 
      carcinoma-associated antigen MOv18. Both phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and monoclonal 
      antibody (MAb) CD3 induced rapid T-cell proliferation, although the growth 
      kinetics after PHA activation were slightly faster. A 50-fold increase in cell 
      number was obtained after 14 and 16 days for PHA and CD3 MAb, respectively. The 
      induction of BsAb-directed cytolysis was faster after CD3 MAb than after PHA 
      activation of lymphocytes, but became similar around day 20. A mixture of media 
      consisting of 78% RPMI 1640, 20% AIM-V and 2% human plasma (Mix-med) yielded 
      better results than 100% AIM-V medium. Culture of lymphocytes in polyolefin bags, 
      compared with tissue culture flasks, or cryopreservation did not affect 
      lymphocyte yield and function. In most cultures the proportion of CD8+ 
      lymphocytes increased, suggesting a growth advantage of CD8+ over CD4+ 
      lymphocytes in this culture system. A protocol employing PHA activation, Mix-med 
      and polyolefin bags has been used successfully to activate and expand blood 
      lymphocytes for the first 5 patients entered into a phase-I/II clinical trial for 
      the intraperitoneal treatment of ovarian carcinoma using CD3 x anti-MOv18 
      BsAb-directed T lymphocytes.

TI  - Important role of the long terminal repeat of the helper Moloney murine leukemia 
      virus in Abelson virus-induced lymphoma.
PG  - 3266-75
AB  - The helper virus has been shown to play a critical role in the development of 
      lymphoma induced by the defective Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV). Indeed, 
      A-MuLV pseudotyped with some viruses, such as the Moloney MuLV, has been shown to 
      be highly lymphogenic, whereas A-MuLV pseudotyped with other viruses, such as the 
      BALB/c endogenous N-tropic MuLV, has been shown to be devoid of lymphogenic 
      potential (N. Rosenberg and D. Baltimore, J. Exp. Med. 147:1126-1141, 1978; C. D. 
      Scher, J. Exp. Med. 147: 1044-1053, 1978). To map the viral DNA sequences 
      encoding the determinant of the lymphogenic potential of Moloney MuLV when 
      complexed with A-MuLV, we constructed chimeric helper viral DNA genomes in vitro 
      between parental cloned infectious viral DNA genomes from Moloney MuLV and from 
      BALB/c endogenous N-tropic MuLV. Chimeric helper MuLVs, recovered after 
      transfection of NIH 3T3 cells were used to rescue A-MuLV, and the pseudotypes 
      were inoculated into newborn NIH Swiss, CD-1, and SWR/J mice to test their 
      lymphogenic potential. We found that a 0.44-kilobase-pair PstI-KpnI long terminal 
      repeat-containing fragment from the Moloney MuLV was sufficient to confer some, 
      but not complete, lymphogenic potential to a chimeric virus (p7M2) in NIH Swiss 
      and SWR/J mice, but not in CD-1 mice. The addition of the 3'-end env sequences 
      (comprising the carboxy terminus of gp70 and all p15E) to the U3 long terminal 
      repeat sequences restored the full lymphogenic potential of the Moloney MuLV. Our 
      data indicate that the 3'-end sequences of the helper Moloney MuLV are somehow 
      involved in the development of lymphoma induced by A-MuLV. The same sequences 
      have previously been found to harbor the determinant of leukemogenicity and of 
      disease specificity of Moloney MuLV when inoculated alone.
