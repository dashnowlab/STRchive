TI  - The RNA-binding protein and stress granule component ATAXIN-2 is expressed in 
      mouse and human tissues associated with glaucoma pathogenesis.
PG  - 537-552

AB  - Polyglutamine repeat expansions in the Ataxin-2 (ATXN2) gene were first 
      implicated in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 2, a disease associated with 
      degeneration of motor neurons and Purkinje cells. Recent studies linked single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms in the gene to elevated intraocular pressure in primary 
      open angle glaucoma (POAG); yet, the localization of ATXN2 across 
      glaucoma-relevant tissues of the vertebrate eye has not been thoroughly examined. 
      This study characterizes ATXN2 expression in the mouse and human retina, and 
      anterior eye, using an antibody validated in ATXN2(-/-) retinas. ATXN2-ir was 
      localized to cytosolic sub compartments in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) somata and 
      proximal dendrites in addition to GABAergic, glycinergic, and cholinergic 
      amacrine cells in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) and displaced amacrine cells. 
      Human, but not mouse retinas showed modest immunolabeling of bipolar cells. ATXN2 
      immunofluorescence was prominent in the trabecular meshwork and pigmented and 
      nonpigmented cells of the ciliary body, with analyses of primary human trabecular 
      meshwork cells confirming the finding. The expression of ATXN2 in key 
      POAG-relevant ocular tissues supports the potential role in autophagy and stress 
      granule formation in response to ocular hypertension.

TI  - Leptospira strains isolated from cattle in the Amazon region, Brazil, evidence of 
      a variety of species and serogroups with a high frequency of the Sejroe 
      serogroup.

AB  - In Brazil, there have been few leptospires isolated from cattle, especially in 
      the Amazon, implying that the epidemiology of the disease in this region is still 
      largely unclear. In a previous study, 52 Leptospira isolates were obtained from 
      urine of cattle raised in the Brazilian Amazon and, to achieve a greater 
      understanding of Leptospira infection in cattle of this region, the present study 
      aimed to serologically and molecularly characterizes all these isolates. The 
      laboratory assays used were the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) adopting a 
      panel of polyclonal antisera against Leptospira spp. for serogrouping the 
      isolates, DNA sequencing (secY) and multiple locus variable number tandem repeat 
      analysis (MLVA). The isolates belonged to five species: 20/52 were identified as 
      L. borgpetersenii (38.5 %); 18/52 as L. kirschneri (34.6 %); 9/52 as L. 
      santarosai (17.3 %); 3/52 as L. noguchii (5.8 %) and 2/52 as L. interrogans (3.8 
      %). With serogrouping, nine different serogroups were detected, with a high 
      frequency of the Sejroe serogroup. MLVA showed that all L. borgpetersenii 
      isolates had a profile compatible with serovar Hardjo; moreover, the other 
      isolates demonstrated a diversity of patterns, and some of them may represent 
      strains not yet characterized. In the Brazilian Amazon, the leptospires 
      circulating in cattle revealed the unique aspects of infections in this area 
      which, in addition to a variety of strains, were characterized by a high 
      frequency of the Sejroe serogroup, highlighting the serovar Hardjo, which has not 
      been reported in other regions of Brazil.

AB  - Coxiella burnetii, the etiological agent of Q fever, is a globally distributed 
      zoonotic disease. The disease was reported serologically in different animal 
      species and humans in Egypt but the genetic information about circulating 
      Coxiella strains is limited. The present study aimed to genetically characterize 
      Coxiella positive samples, identified in abortive sheep, based on a 17-loci 
      Multiple Locus Variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) panel and 
      Multispacer Sequence Typing (MST). Four MLVA types were found among six examined 
      samples. While all three samples examined by MST were identified as novel 
      sequence type (ST) closely related to human heart valve isolates from France, 
      Saudi Arabia, USA and United Kingdom. This study provides the first genetic 
      information about circulating Coxiella strains in Egypt and improves 
      epidemiological data of Q fever in the country.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous nosocomial infections including urinary tract infection 
      (UTI) have been reported to be linked to Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). 
      This bacterium is one of the most common pathogen colonized in the urinary tract. 
      The main purpose of this study was to evaluated the presence of antibiotic 
      resistance genes and also the most frequent genotype patterns of P. aeruginosa in 
      the patients with UTI hospitalized in different wards of hospitals. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: In this study, 70 strains of P. aeruginosa isolated of urine samples 
      from the patients with UTI were assessed. The isolated strains were genotyped 
      using Multiple-Locus Variable Number Tandem Repeat Analysis (MLVA) method. We 
      have also analyzed the presence of TEM and SHV resistant genes in the isolates. 
      RESULTS: A total of 70 P. aeruginosa strains was isolated from the UTI patients. 
      Based on MLVA method, 61 various genotypes of P. aeruginosa were identified which 
      grouped into two main clusters and 4 sub-clusters. Moreover, approximately 80% 
      and 70% of isolated strains carried the TEM and SHV resistance genes, 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that the majority of patients 
      hospitalized in different wards of hospitals have experienced the urinary tract 
      infection caused by P. aeruginosa. According to the genotyping results, a high 
      diversity of the P. aeruginosa population was observed in the patients with UTI. 
      Our results can provide a better understanding of the P. aeruginosa genotype 
      distribution and epidemiology of infection, which can be applied as basic data 
      for future antibiotic therapies.

AB  - Canine monocytic ehrlichiosis, an important tick-borne disease caused by 
      Ehrlichia canis, is cosmopolitan but particularly prevalent in tropical and 
      subtropical regions. In Turkey, the genetic diversity of E. canis remains 
      undefined. The aim of this study was to characterize E. canis in naturally 
      infected dogs from Turkey by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the Tandem 
      Repeat Protein 36 (TRP36) encoded by the trp36 gene. A total of 167 archived 
      blood samples randomly collected from municipal shelter dogs in three distinct 
      geographic regions were analyzed for E. canis. Only ten samples (5.98%) were 
      found positive by PCR assays target regions of the trp36 and 16S rRNA genes. 
      Sequence analysis of Turkish E. canis TRP36 revealed five Tanden Repeat sequences 
      (TRs) resulting to three TR genotypes: i) the previously reported US genotype 
      composed exclusively from TRs of "TEDSVSAPA" sequence (14 or 8 TRs), ii) the 
      previously Brazilian genotype composed exclusively from TRs of ASVVPEAE sequence 
      (13 TRs), and iii) a novel genotype. In addition, phylogenetic analysis based on 
      the entire sequences of TRP36 revealed that these genotypes correspond to four 
      distinct genogroups (US genogroups I and II, Brazilian genogroup and Costa 
      Rica-Turkey genogroup), all containing Turkish genotypes amongst other 
      geographically distant E. canisgenotypes.

AB  - The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence, antibiotic resistance, 
      presence of class 1 and 2 integrons, Extended Spectrum beta-Lactamases (ESBL) genes, 
      phylogenetic group and epidemiological relationships of EPEC, ETEC and EHEC 
      pathotypes isolated from patients with diarrhea and farm animals in south east 
      region of Iran. A total of 671 diarrheagenic E. coli (DEC) were collected from 
      stool samples of 395 patients with diarrhea and 276 farm cattles and goats. 
      Presence of EPEC, ETEC and EHEC were identified using multiplex-PCR employing 
      primers targeted the shiga toxin (stx), intimin (eae), bundle forming pili (bfp), 
      and enterotoxins (lt and st) genes. The highest proportion of the patients (64%) 
      were children under age 1-15 year (p </= 0.05). Among the isolates, atypical EPEC 
      was detected in 26 patients and 14 animal stool samples, while typical EPEC was 
      found in 2 cattles. ETEC isolates were detected in stools of 13 patients and 4 
      EHEC was identified in 3 goats and one cattle. The isolates were checked for 
      susceptibility to 14 antibiotics. 50% (n = 13) of EPEC and 61.5% (n =8) of ETEC 
      showed multi-drug resistance (MDR) profiles and one EPEC was found to be 
      extensive drug resistant (XDR). In contrast, EHEC isolates were susceptible to 
      the majority of antimicrobial agents. The MDR isolates were positive for bla(TEM) 
      and bla(CTX-M) ESBL genes and carried class 1 integrons. Further study on the 
      biofilm formation indicated that, 3 out of 4 EHEC isolates showed strong biofilm, 
      while other pathotypes had either moderate, weak or no biofilm activity. Majority 
      of EPEC isolates were belonged to phylogenetic group B1, all except one ETEC were 
      classified as phylogenetic group A and two EHEC were belonged to phylogroup D, 
      respectively. A multilocus variable tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) exhibited 22 
      distinct patterns. In conclusion, MLVA data showed high clonal diversity. 
      Presence of EHEC in animal origins pose public health concern in this region.

TI  - A B-Z junction induced by an A ... A mismatch in GAC repeats in the gene for 
      cartilage oligomeric matrix protein promotes binding with the hZalpha(ADAR1) protein.
PG  - 18732-18746
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M117.796235 [doi]
AB  - GAC repeat expansion from five to seven in the exonic region of the gene for 
      cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) leads to pseudoachondroplasia, a 
      skeletal abnormality. However, the molecular mechanism by which GAC expansions in 
      the COMP gene lead to skeletal dysplasias is poorly understood. Here we used 
      molecular dynamics simulations, which indicate that an A ... A mismatch in a 
      d(GAC)(6).d(GAC)(6) duplex induces negative supercoiling, leading to a local 
      B-to-Z DNA transition. This transition facilitates the binding of 
      d(GAC)(7).d(GAC)(7) with the Zalpha-binding domain of human adenosine deaminase 
      acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1, hZalpha(ADAR1)), as confirmed by CD, NMR, and microscale 
      thermophoresis studies. The CD results indicated that hZalpha(ADAR1) recognizes the 
      zigzag backbone of d(GAC)(7).d(GAC)(7) at the B-Z junction and subsequently 
      converts it into Z-DNA via the so-called passive mechanism. Molecular dynamics 
      simulations carried out for the modeled hZalpha(ADAR1)-d(GAC)(6)d(GAC)(6) complex 
      confirmed the retention of previously reported important interactions between the 
      two molecules. These findings suggest that hZalpha(ADAR1) binding with the GAC 
      hairpin stem in COMP can lead to a non-genetic, RNA editing-mediated substitution 
      in COMP that may then play a crucial role in the development of 
      pseudoachondroplasia.

TI  - The interaction of early life experiences with COMT val158met affects anxiety 
      sensitivity.
PG  - 821-9
LID - 10.1111/gbb.12090 [doi]
AB  - The pathogenesis of anxiety disorders is considered to be multifactorial with a 
      complex interaction of genetic factors and individual environmental factors. 
      Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine gene-by-environment interactions 
      of the genes coding for catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and monoamine oxidase 
      A (MAOA) with life events on measures related to anxiety. A sample of healthy 
      subjects (N = 782; thereof 531 women; mean age M = 24.79, SD = 6.02) was 
      genotyped for COMT rs4680 and MAOA-uVNTR (upstream variable number of tandem 
      repeats), and was assessed for childhood adversities [Childhood Trauma 
      Questionnaire (CTQ)], anxiety sensitivity [Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI)] and 
      anxious apprehension [Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ)]. Main and 
      interaction effects of genotype, environment and gender on measures related to 
      anxiety were assessed by means of regression analyses. Association analysis 
      showed no main gene effect on either questionnaire score. A significant 
      interactive effect of childhood adversities and COMT genotype was observed: 
      Homozygosity for the low-active met allele and high CTQ scores was associated 
      with a significant increment of explained ASI variance [R(2) = 0.040, false 
      discovery rate (FDR) corrected P = 0.04]. A borderline interactive effect with 
      respect to MAOA-uVNTR was restricted to the male subgroup. Carriers of the 
      low-active MAOA allele who reported more aversive experiences in childhood 
      exhibited a trend for enhanced anxious apprehension (R(2) = 0.077, FDR corrected 
      P = 0.10). Early aversive life experiences therefore might increase the 
      vulnerability to anxiety disorders in the presence of homozygosity for the COMT 
      158met allele or low-active MAOA-uVNTR alleles.

AB  - Many episodes of canine brucellosis in dog kennels have been reported but 
      recently an outbreak that involved pets and their owners has been described. The 
      purpose of this study was to confirm that the outbreak had a common source and 
      evaluate the evolution of 4 dogs involved in this outbreak after the measures 
      implemented that included a survey of 41 animals from the same area. The variable 
      number of tandem repeat (VNTR) analysis indicated that the B. canis isolated from 
      the human clustered together with the isolates collected from the canine pups. 
      Two dogs continued with bacteremia after the first antibiotic therapy and from 
      one of them B. canis was also isolated from urine showing the importance of the 
      later in the infection dissemination. In an effort to protect the public, stray 
      dogs should be controlled and educational programs about the risk of this 
      zoonotic disease should be implemented.

TI  - Molecular typing of Mycoplasma agalactiae: tracing European-wide genetic 
      diversity and an endemic clonal population.
PG  - 487-96
LID - 10.1016/j.cimid.2012.04.005 [doi]
AB  - Mycoplasma agalactiae causes chronic infections in small ruminants and remains 
      endemic in many regions of the world, despite intensive and costly eradication 
      programs. In this study, the innate genomic plasticity of M. agalactiae was 
      exploited to design and assess a combination of molecular epidemiological tools 
      to trace the pathogen in different geographic locations and to understand its 
      emergence or re-emergence after eradication campaigns. For this purpose, two 
      collections of M. agalactiae isolates, representing European outbreaks or 
      localized endemic disease in a single region of France, were subjected to RFLP 
      (Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism) analyses using two sets of DNA probes 
      (distributed across the genome and specific for the vpma gene locus), and a 
      previously described VNTR (Variable Number Tandem Repeats) analysis. A 
      combination of four genome-specific DNA probes and two VNTRs gave the highest 
      discriminative power. Molecular typing revealed that, while isolates from diverse 
      geographical origins fell into clearly different groups, the endemic disease 
      repeatedly observed in the Western Pyrenees region over the past 30 years has 
      been caused by a unique subtype of M. agalactiae. This indicates that the 
      re-emergence of the pathogen after seemingly successful eradication programs is 
      not due to the importation of exotic strains, but to the persistence of local 
      reservoirs of infection.

TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility and molecular subtyping of 55 Turkish Bacillus 
      anthracis strains using 25-loci multiple-locus VNTR analysis.

AB  - Anthrax, which is caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis, is one of the 
      oldest documented infectious diseases in both livestock and humans. The 
      differentiation of B. anthracis strains is difficult because of their highly 
      homogeneous genomes. We used multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat 
      analysis (MLVA) with 25 markers to genotype 55 B. anthracis isolates from 16 
      distinct regions of Turkey. The antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates was 
      investigated using the agar dilution method. An eight-loci MLVA assay revealed 
      six unique genotypes (G(K)13, G(K)27, G(K)35, G(K)43, G(K)44, and G(K)61). 
      However, the 25-loci MLVA was more discriminatory, revealing the presence of ten 
      genotypes instead of six. The additional genotypes resulted from the split of 
      four subtypes: G(K)35 (b and c), G(K)43 (a and f), G(K)44 (d and e), and G(K)61 
      (i and j). All of the Turkish B. anthracis isolates were susceptible to 
      ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, tigecycline, linezolid, and vancomycin. One isolate 
      was resistant to penicillin and to doxycycline. A total of 34 isolates were 
      susceptible, 20 isolates were partially susceptible, and one isolate was 
      resistant to erythromycin. None of the isolates exhibited susceptibility to 
      cefotaxime. A total of 53 isolates were susceptible to gentamicin, and two were 
      resistant. The genotypes G(K)35 (n=24), G(K)44 (n=13), and G(K)43 (n=10) were the 
      most prevalent in 10, 6, and 5 regions, respectively, of the total 16 provinces. 
      The B. anthracis isolates collected from these regions implied that the movement 
      of B. anthracis is a result of the increased transportation of livestock and the 
      resultant cross contamination.

TI  - Trinucleotide expansion mutations in the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein 
      (COMP) gene.
PG  - 123-8
AB  - Pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH) and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED) are two 
      human autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasias characterized by variable short 
      stature, joint laxity and early-onset degenerative joint disease. Both disorders 
      can result from mut-ations in the gene for cartilage oligomeric matrix protein 
      (COMP), an extracellular matrix glycoprotein. About one-third of PSACH cases 
      result from heterozygosity for deletion of one codon within a very short triplet 
      repeat, (GAC)5, which encodes five consecutive aspartic acid residues within the 
      calmodulin-like region of the COMP protein. We have identified two expansion 
      mut-ations in this repeat: an MED patient carrying a (GAC)6allele and a PSACH 
      patient carrying a (GAC)7allele. These are among the shortest disease-causing 
      triplet repeat expansion mutations described thus far, and are the first 
      identified in a GAC repeat. A unique feature of this sequence is that expansion 
      as well as shortening of the repeat can cause the same disease. In cartilage, 
      both patients have rough endoplasmic reticulum inclusions in chondrocytes. The 
      inclusions are also present in tendon tissue and can be reproduced in cultured 
      tendon cells, suggesting that the pathophysiology of disease is similar in both 
      cartilage and tendon.
