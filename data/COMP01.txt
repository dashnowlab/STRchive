AB  - Congenital immunity mediated by Toll-like receptor (TLR) family is the first line 
      of defense for disease-resistant immunity of fish and plays a vital role as a 
      bridge between innate immunity and acquired immunity. As a less known member of 
      the TLR family TLR13 can participate in the immune and inflammatory reactions of 
      the body for recognizing the conserved sequence of 23S rRNA in bacteria and 
      induce immune response. In this study, the full-length cDNA of TLR13 from Nibea 
      albiflora (named as NaTLR13) was cloned and was functionally characterized. It 
      was 4210bp (GenBank accession no. MT701899) including an open reading frame (ORF) 
      of 2886bp to encode 962 amino acids with molecular weight of 110.37 kDa and the 
      theoretical isoelectric point of 9.08. There were several conservative structures 
      in NaTLR13 such as 15 leucine-rich repeat sequences (LRRs), a Toll-IL-1 receptor 
      domain (TIR), an LRR-CT terminal domain, two LRR-TYP structures and two 
      transmembrane domains. The multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis 
      manifested that NaTLR13 had high similarity with Larimichthys crocea and 
      Collichthys lucidus (88.79% and 87.02%, respectively) and they fell into the same 
      branch. The Real-time PCR showed that NaTLR13 was expressed in all selected 
      tissues, with the highest in the spleen, followed by the liver, kidney, gill, 
      heart and muscle. After being challenged by Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio 
      parahaemolyticus or Poly (I:C), the expression of NaTLR13 increased firstly, then 
      decreased and finally stabilized with time for its immune defense function. 
      Subcellular localization analysis revealed that NaTLR13 was unevenly distributed 
      in the cytoplasm with green fluorescence and MyD88 was evenly spread in the 
      cytoplasm with red signals. When NaTLR13 and MyD88 were co-transfected, they 
      obviously overlapped and displayed orange-yellow color, which showed that the 
      homologous TLR13 might interact with MyD88 for NFkappaB signaling pathway 
      transmission. The functional domains of NaTLR13 (named NaTLR13-TIR and 
      NaTLR13-LRR) were expressed in E.coli BL21 (DE3) and purified by Ni-NAT Superflow 
      Resin conforming to the expected molecular weights, and the recombinant proteins 
      could bind to three Vibrios (V.alginolyticus, V.parahaemolyticus and Vibrio 
      harveyi), indicating that NaTLR13 could be bounden to bacteria through its 
      functional domain. These results suggested that NaTLR13 might play an important 
      role in the defense of N.albiflora against bacteria or viral infection and the 
      data would provide some information for further understanding the regulatory 
      mechanism of the innate immune system in fish.

TI  - The RNA-binding protein and stress granule component ATAXIN-2 is expressed in 
      mouse and human tissues associated with glaucoma pathogenesis.
PG  - 537-552
LID - 10.1002/cne.25228 [doi]
AB  - Polyglutamine repeat expansions in the Ataxin-2 (ATXN2) gene were first 
      implicated in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 2, a disease associated with 
      degeneration of motor neurons and Purkinje cells. Recent studies linked single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms in the gene to elevated intraocular pressure in primary 
      open angle glaucoma (POAG); yet, the localization of ATXN2 across 
      glaucoma-relevant tissues of the vertebrate eye has not been thoroughly examined. 
      This study characterizes ATXN2 expression in the mouse and human retina, and 
      anterior eye, using an antibody validated in ATXN2(-/-) retinas. ATXN2-ir was 
      localized to cytosolic sub compartments in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) somata and 
      proximal dendrites in addition to GABAergic, glycinergic, and cholinergic 
      amacrine cells in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) and displaced amacrine cells. 
      Human, but not mouse retinas showed modest immunolabeling of bipolar cells. ATXN2 
      immunofluorescence was prominent in the trabecular meshwork and pigmented and 
      nonpigmented cells of the ciliary body, with analyses of primary human trabecular 
      meshwork cells confirming the finding. The expression of ATXN2 in key 
      POAG-relevant ocular tissues supports the potential role in autophagy and stress 
      granule formation in response to ocular hypertension.

TI  - Is Medicaid expansion associated with increases in palliative treatments for 
      metastatic cancer?
PG  - 733-741
LID - 10.2217/cer-2020-0178 [doi]
AB  - Background: Medicaid expansion following the 2010 Affordable Care Act has an 
      unknown impact on palliative treatments. Materials & methods: This registry-based 
      study of individuals with metastatic cancer from 2010 to 2016 identified men and 
      women with metastatic cancer in expansion and non-expansion states who received 
      palliative treatments. A mixed effects logistic regression compared trends in 
      expansion and non-expansion states and generated risk-adjusted probabilities or 
      receiving palliative treatments each year. Results: Despite lower baseline use of 
      palliative treatments, the rate of change was more rapid in expansion states 
      (odds ratio [OR]: 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01-1.03; p < 0.001). The adjusted probability 
      of receiving palliative treatments rose from 21.3 to 26.0% in non-expansion 
      states, and from 19.7 to 26.9% in expansion states. Conclusion: Use of palliative 
      treatments among metastatic cancer patients increased from 2010 to 2016 with a 
      significantly greater increase in Medicaid expansion states, even when adjusting 
      for demographic differences between states.

OAB - Lay abstract Palliative treatments are a crucial tool for improving quality of 
      life among those with advanced and incurable cancer. Increases in palliative 
      treatments have been seen from 2010 to 2016 with a greater rate of increase in 
      states which expanded Medicaid insurance coverage. Increases in insurance 
      coverage in concert with policies to increase coverage of palliative and end of 
      life care may increase access to palliative services.

TI  - Leptospira strains isolated from cattle in the Amazon region, Brazil, evidence of 
      a variety of species and serogroups with a high frequency of the Sejroe 
      serogroup.

AB  - In Brazil, there have been few leptospires isolated from cattle, especially in 
      the Amazon, implying that the epidemiology of the disease in this region is still 
      largely unclear. In a previous study, 52 Leptospira isolates were obtained from 
      urine of cattle raised in the Brazilian Amazon and, to achieve a greater 
      understanding of Leptospira infection in cattle of this region, the present study 
      aimed to serologically and molecularly characterizes all these isolates. The 
      laboratory assays used were the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) adopting a 
      panel of polyclonal antisera against Leptospira spp. for serogrouping the 
      isolates, DNA sequencing (secY) and multiple locus variable number tandem repeat 
      analysis (MLVA). The isolates belonged to five species: 20/52 were identified as 
      L. borgpetersenii (38.5 %); 18/52 as L. kirschneri (34.6 %); 9/52 as L. 
      santarosai (17.3 %); 3/52 as L. noguchii (5.8 %) and 2/52 as L. interrogans (3.8 
      %). With serogrouping, nine different serogroups were detected, with a high 
      frequency of the Sejroe serogroup. MLVA showed that all L. borgpetersenii 
      isolates had a profile compatible with serovar Hardjo; moreover, the other 
      isolates demonstrated a diversity of patterns, and some of them may represent 
      strains not yet characterized. In the Brazilian Amazon, the leptospires 
      circulating in cattle revealed the unique aspects of infections in this area 
      which, in addition to a variety of strains, were characterized by a high 
      frequency of the Sejroe serogroup, highlighting the serovar Hardjo, which has not 
      been reported in other regions of Brazil.

AB  - Autoimmune diseases are characterized by alteration in balance of various 
      cytokines. Rheumatoid arthritis is a well-known inflammatory disease leading to 
      destruction of cartilage at knee and hands. Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is a 
      common autoimmune model for rheumatoid arthritis study. Here, we have 
      investigated the therapeutic role of medicarpin, a natural pterocarpan with known 
      anti-osteoclastogenic activities, in postmenopausal polyarthritis model of DBA/1J 
      mice. For this, mice were ovariectomized and CIA was induced in OVx animals with 
      primary immunization. After 21 days, booster dose was injected in Ovariectomy 
      (OVx) mice to develop postmenopausal poly-arthritis mice model. Medicarpin 
      treatment in mice at dose of 10.0 mg/kg/body wt was started after 21 days of 
      primary immunization for one month of time period every day orally. We found that 
      medicarpin prevented alteration of TH-17/Treg ratio in CIA model leading to 
      reduced osteoclastogenesis. Micro Computed Tomography (Micro-CT) analysis 
      demonstrated that medicarpin prevents cartilage erosion in joints and restores 
      loss of trabeculae parameters in distal tibia. Treatment with medicarpin also 
      prevented alteration of various cytokines level by down-regulating various 
      pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-17A, while up-regulating 
      anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in CIA model of mice. Biological marker of 
      arthritis is cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP). COMP level was 
      up-regulated in CIA induced mice while treatment with medicarpin significantly 
      restored the serum level of COMP compared with untreated groups. Cartilage 
      staining by Safranin-O also indicates that cartilage destruction in joints of CIA 
      mice was prevented by medicarpin treatment. From this study, we can conclude that 
      medicarpin is effective in preventing arthritis in post-menopausal conditions.

AB  - Coxiella burnetii, the etiological agent of Q fever, is a globally distributed 
      zoonotic disease. The disease was reported serologically in different animal 
      species and humans in Egypt but the genetic information about circulating 
      Coxiella strains is limited. The present study aimed to genetically characterize 
      Coxiella positive samples, identified in abortive sheep, based on a 17-loci 
      Multiple Locus Variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) panel and 
      Multispacer Sequence Typing (MST). Four MLVA types were found among six examined 
      samples. While all three samples examined by MST were identified as novel 
      sequence type (ST) closely related to human heart valve isolates from France, 
      Saudi Arabia, USA and United Kingdom. This study provides the first genetic 
      information about circulating Coxiella strains in Egypt and improves 
      epidemiological data of Q fever in the country.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous nosocomial infections including urinary tract infection 
      (UTI) have been reported to be linked to Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). 
      This bacterium is one of the most common pathogen colonized in the urinary tract. 
      The main purpose of this study was to evaluated the presence of antibiotic 
      resistance genes and also the most frequent genotype patterns of P. aeruginosa in 
      the patients with UTI hospitalized in different wards of hospitals. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: In this study, 70 strains of P. aeruginosa isolated of urine samples 
      from the patients with UTI were assessed. The isolated strains were genotyped 
      using Multiple-Locus Variable Number Tandem Repeat Analysis (MLVA) method. We 
      have also analyzed the presence of TEM and SHV resistant genes in the isolates. 
      RESULTS: A total of 70 P. aeruginosa strains was isolated from the UTI patients. 
      Based on MLVA method, 61 various genotypes of P. aeruginosa were identified which 
      grouped into two main clusters and 4 sub-clusters. Moreover, approximately 80% 
      and 70% of isolated strains carried the TEM and SHV resistance genes, 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that the majority of patients 
      hospitalized in different wards of hospitals have experienced the urinary tract 
      infection caused by P. aeruginosa. According to the genotyping results, a high 
      diversity of the P. aeruginosa population was observed in the patients with UTI. 
      Our results can provide a better understanding of the P. aeruginosa genotype 
      distribution and epidemiology of infection, which can be applied as basic data 
      for future antibiotic therapies.

AB  - Canine monocytic ehrlichiosis, an important tick-borne disease caused by 
      Ehrlichia canis, is cosmopolitan but particularly prevalent in tropical and 
      subtropical regions. In Turkey, the genetic diversity of E. canis remains 
      undefined. The aim of this study was to characterize E. canis in naturally 
      infected dogs from Turkey by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the Tandem 
      Repeat Protein 36 (TRP36) encoded by the trp36 gene. A total of 167 archived 
      blood samples randomly collected from municipal shelter dogs in three distinct 
      geographic regions were analyzed for E. canis. Only ten samples (5.98%) were 
      found positive by PCR assays target regions of the trp36 and 16S rRNA genes. 
      Sequence analysis of Turkish E. canis TRP36 revealed five Tanden Repeat sequences 
      (TRs) resulting to three TR genotypes: i) the previously reported US genotype 
      composed exclusively from TRs of "TEDSVSAPA" sequence (14 or 8 TRs), ii) the 
      previously Brazilian genotype composed exclusively from TRs of ASVVPEAE sequence 
      (13 TRs), and iii) a novel genotype. In addition, phylogenetic analysis based on 
      the entire sequences of TRP36 revealed that these genotypes correspond to four 
      distinct genogroups (US genogroups I and II, Brazilian genogroup and Costa 
      Rica-Turkey genogroup), all containing Turkish genotypes amongst other 
      geographically distant E. canisgenotypes.

AB  - The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence, antibiotic resistance, 
      presence of class 1 and 2 integrons, Extended Spectrum beta-Lactamases (ESBL) genes, 
      phylogenetic group and epidemiological relationships of EPEC, ETEC and EHEC 
      pathotypes isolated from patients with diarrhea and farm animals in south east 
      region of Iran. A total of 671 diarrheagenic E. coli (DEC) were collected from 
      stool samples of 395 patients with diarrhea and 276 farm cattles and goats. 
      Presence of EPEC, ETEC and EHEC were identified using multiplex-PCR employing 
      primers targeted the shiga toxin (stx), intimin (eae), bundle forming pili (bfp), 
      and enterotoxins (lt and st) genes. The highest proportion of the patients (64%) 
      were children under age 1-15 year (p </= 0.05). Among the isolates, atypical EPEC 
      was detected in 26 patients and 14 animal stool samples, while typical EPEC was 
      found in 2 cattles. ETEC isolates were detected in stools of 13 patients and 4 
      EHEC was identified in 3 goats and one cattle. The isolates were checked for 
      susceptibility to 14 antibiotics. 50% (n = 13) of EPEC and 61.5% (n =8) of ETEC 
      showed multi-drug resistance (MDR) profiles and one EPEC was found to be 
      extensive drug resistant (XDR). In contrast, EHEC isolates were susceptible to 
      the majority of antimicrobial agents. The MDR isolates were positive for bla(TEM) 
      and bla(CTX-M) ESBL genes and carried class 1 integrons. Further study on the 
      biofilm formation indicated that, 3 out of 4 EHEC isolates showed strong biofilm, 
      while other pathotypes had either moderate, weak or no biofilm activity. Majority 
      of EPEC isolates were belonged to phylogenetic group B1, all except one ETEC were 
      classified as phylogenetic group A and two EHEC were belonged to phylogroup D, 
      respectively. A multilocus variable tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) exhibited 22 
      distinct patterns. In conclusion, MLVA data showed high clonal diversity. 
      Presence of EHEC in animal origins pose public health concern in this region.

AB  - PURPOSE: In vitro expansion is an invaluable method to obtain keratinocytes in 
      amounts necessary for effective transplantation therapies. In vitro cell 
      culturing provokes questions concerning potential epigenetic alterations 
      occurring in expanded cells in the context of usefulness for transplantation and 
      safety. The purpose of this study was to investigate as to whether keratinocyte 
      expansion is associated with changes in the activity of genes responsible for the 
      maintenance of epigenetic stability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We focussed on the 
      transcriptional activity of genes involved in different epigenetic mechanisms 
      including DNA methylation and histone modifications. We used quantitative 
      real-time PCR to determine transcript levels of 16 epigenetic remodelling markers 
      in 14 patients in the epidermal cells directly after collection and after in 
      vitro expansion. RESULTS: We observed a remarkable decline in the transcriptional 
      activity of the epigenetic remodelling genes following in vitro expansion, while 
      no further fall of expression with passaging. In whole skin, we found even higher 
      expression levels of the epigenetic markers. CONCLUSIONS: Transmission to in 
      vitro environment challenges cellular signalling and metabolism. The regulation 
      of epigenetic remodelling maintains the balance between cellular plasticity and 
      phenotype deviation. This preliminary research demonstrated reduced activity of 
      genes responsible for epigenetic modifications of DNA and histones in in vitro 
      expanded epidermal cells. This observation indicates that epigenome re-patterning 
      in cultured epidermal cells is significantly less intensive than in the skin. 
      Also, this observation may imply that after adaptation to in vitro conditions, 
      the epigenome does not undergo extensive transformation during further 
      cultivation.

TI  - A B-Z junction induced by an A ... A mismatch in GAC repeats in the gene for 
      cartilage oligomeric matrix protein promotes binding with the hZalpha(ADAR1) protein.
PG  - 18732-18746
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M117.796235 [doi]
AB  - GAC repeat expansion from five to seven in the exonic region of the gene for 
      cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) leads to pseudoachondroplasia, a 
      skeletal abnormality. However, the molecular mechanism by which GAC expansions in 
      the COMP gene lead to skeletal dysplasias is poorly understood. Here we used 
      molecular dynamics simulations, which indicate that an A ... A mismatch in a 
      d(GAC)(6).d(GAC)(6) duplex induces negative supercoiling, leading to a local 
      B-to-Z DNA transition. This transition facilitates the binding of 
      d(GAC)(7).d(GAC)(7) with the Zalpha-binding domain of human adenosine deaminase 
      acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1, hZalpha(ADAR1)), as confirmed by CD, NMR, and microscale 
      thermophoresis studies. The CD results indicated that hZalpha(ADAR1) recognizes the 
      zigzag backbone of d(GAC)(7).d(GAC)(7) at the B-Z junction and subsequently 
      converts it into Z-DNA via the so-called passive mechanism. Molecular dynamics 
      simulations carried out for the modeled hZalpha(ADAR1)-d(GAC)(6)d(GAC)(6) complex 
      confirmed the retention of previously reported important interactions between the 
      two molecules. These findings suggest that hZalpha(ADAR1) binding with the GAC 
      hairpin stem in COMP can lead to a non-genetic, RNA editing-mediated substitution 
      in COMP that may then play a crucial role in the development of 
      pseudoachondroplasia.

TI  - The interaction of early life experiences with COMT val158met affects anxiety 
      sensitivity.
PG  - 821-9
LID - 10.1111/gbb.12090 [doi]
AB  - The pathogenesis of anxiety disorders is considered to be multifactorial with a 
      complex interaction of genetic factors and individual environmental factors. 
      Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine gene-by-environment interactions 
      of the genes coding for catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and monoamine oxidase 
      A (MAOA) with life events on measures related to anxiety. A sample of healthy 
      subjects (N = 782; thereof 531 women; mean age M = 24.79, SD = 6.02) was 
      genotyped for COMT rs4680 and MAOA-uVNTR (upstream variable number of tandem 
      repeats), and was assessed for childhood adversities [Childhood Trauma 
      Questionnaire (CTQ)], anxiety sensitivity [Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI)] and 
      anxious apprehension [Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ)]. Main and 
      interaction effects of genotype, environment and gender on measures related to 
      anxiety were assessed by means of regression analyses. Association analysis 
      showed no main gene effect on either questionnaire score. A significant 
      interactive effect of childhood adversities and COMT genotype was observed: 
      Homozygosity for the low-active met allele and high CTQ scores was associated 
      with a significant increment of explained ASI variance [R(2) = 0.040, false 
      discovery rate (FDR) corrected P = 0.04]. A borderline interactive effect with 
      respect to MAOA-uVNTR was restricted to the male subgroup. Carriers of the 
      low-active MAOA allele who reported more aversive experiences in childhood 
      exhibited a trend for enhanced anxious apprehension (R(2) = 0.077, FDR corrected 
      P = 0.10). Early aversive life experiences therefore might increase the 
      vulnerability to anxiety disorders in the presence of homozygosity for the COMT 
      158met allele or low-active MAOA-uVNTR alleles.

TI  - Simian T-lymphotropic Virus-associated lymphoma in 2 naturally infected baboons: 
      T-cell clonal expansion and immune response during tumor development.
PG  - 288-94
AB  - Two young female baboons naturally infected with simian T-lymphotropic virus type 
      1 (STLV1) were euthanized due to chronic respiratory disease that was 
      unresponsive to treatment. Massive lymphocytic infiltration of the lung 
      interstitium suggested a diagnosis of STLV-associated lymphoma. In each case, the 
      diagnosis was confirmed through inverse PCR (IPCR) that detected monoclonally 
      integrated STLV1 provirus in cellular DNA extracted from lymphoma tissue and 
      peripheral blood cells (PBC). One dominant STLV1-infected T-cell clone and 3 
      minor clones were detected in PBC from each baboon. Using archived PBC DNA and 
      primers within the proviral genome and chromosomal DNA flanking the STLV1 
      integration sites in PCR analyses, we determined that the dominant clone in one 
      baboon had first appeared approximately 8 mo after infection and had circulated 
      for 4 y before clinical disease developed. ELISA testing of archived serum 
      revealed that both baboons seroconverted to the p19 and p24 gag proteins and the 
      envelope gp46 protein but not to the viral tax protein. Titers to p24 and gp46 
      rose significantly after infection and remained relatively constant until death, 
      whereas titers to p19 increased with time. Although spontaneous STLV1-associated 
      lymphomas have been described in baboons, the STLV1-associated lymphomas 
      described here occurred in 2 relatively young baboons, both of whom had become 
      infected with STLV at 3 to 4 y of age and developed lymphoma within 5 y of 
      infection.

AB  - Many episodes of canine brucellosis in dog kennels have been reported but 
      recently an outbreak that involved pets and their owners has been described. The 
      purpose of this study was to confirm that the outbreak had a common source and 
      evaluate the evolution of 4 dogs involved in this outbreak after the measures 
      implemented that included a survey of 41 animals from the same area. The variable 
      number of tandem repeat (VNTR) analysis indicated that the B. canis isolated from 
      the human clustered together with the isolates collected from the canine pups. 
      Two dogs continued with bacteremia after the first antibiotic therapy and from 
      one of them B. canis was also isolated from urine showing the importance of the 
      later in the infection dissemination. In an effort to protect the public, stray 
      dogs should be controlled and educational programs about the risk of this 
      zoonotic disease should be implemented.

AB  - Mycoplasma agalactiae causes chronic infections in small ruminants and remains 
      endemic in many regions of the world, despite intensive and costly eradication 
      programs. In this study, the innate genomic plasticity of M. agalactiae was 
      exploited to design and assess a combination of molecular epidemiological tools 
      to trace the pathogen in different geographic locations and to understand its 
      emergence or re-emergence after eradication campaigns. For this purpose, two 
      collections of M. agalactiae isolates, representing European outbreaks or 
      localized endemic disease in a single region of France, were subjected to RFLP 
      (Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism) analyses using two sets of DNA probes 
      (distributed across the genome and specific for the vpma gene locus), and a 
      previously described VNTR (Variable Number Tandem Repeats) analysis. A 
      combination of four genome-specific DNA probes and two VNTRs gave the highest 
      discriminative power. Molecular typing revealed that, while isolates from diverse 
      geographical origins fell into clearly different groups, the endemic disease 
      repeatedly observed in the Western Pyrenees region over the past 30 years has 
      been caused by a unique subtype of M. agalactiae. This indicates that the 
      re-emergence of the pathogen after seemingly successful eradication programs is 
      not due to the importation of exotic strains, but to the persistence of local 
      reservoirs of infection.

TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility and molecular subtyping of 55 Turkish Bacillus 
      anthracis strains using 25-loci multiple-locus VNTR analysis.
PG  - 355-61
LID - 10.1016/j.cimid.2012.02.005 [doi]
AB  - Anthrax, which is caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis, is one of the 
      oldest documented infectious diseases in both livestock and humans. The 
      differentiation of B. anthracis strains is difficult because of their highly 
      homogeneous genomes. We used multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat 
      analysis (MLVA) with 25 markers to genotype 55 B. anthracis isolates from 16 
      distinct regions of Turkey. The antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates was 
      investigated using the agar dilution method. An eight-loci MLVA assay revealed 
      six unique genotypes (G(K)13, G(K)27, G(K)35, G(K)43, G(K)44, and G(K)61). 
      However, the 25-loci MLVA was more discriminatory, revealing the presence of ten 
      genotypes instead of six. The additional genotypes resulted from the split of 
      four subtypes: G(K)35 (b and c), G(K)43 (a and f), G(K)44 (d and e), and G(K)61 
      (i and j). All of the Turkish B. anthracis isolates were susceptible to 
      ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, tigecycline, linezolid, and vancomycin. One isolate 
      was resistant to penicillin and to doxycycline. A total of 34 isolates were 
      susceptible, 20 isolates were partially susceptible, and one isolate was 
      resistant to erythromycin. None of the isolates exhibited susceptibility to 
      cefotaxime. A total of 53 isolates were susceptible to gentamicin, and two were 
      resistant. The genotypes G(K)35 (n=24), G(K)44 (n=13), and G(K)43 (n=10) were the 
      most prevalent in 10, 6, and 5 regions, respectively, of the total 16 provinces. 
      The B. anthracis isolates collected from these regions implied that the movement 
      of B. anthracis is a result of the increased transportation of livestock and the 
      resultant cross contamination.

TI  - Identification of novel and recurrent mutations in the calcium binding type III 
      repeats of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein in patients with 
      pseudoachondroplasia.
PG  - 955-63
LID - 10.4238/vol10-2gmr1111 [doi]
AB  - Pseudoachondroplasia is an autosomal dominant osteochondrodysplasia characterized 
      by disproportionate short stature, joint laxity, and early onset osteoarthrosis. 
      Pseudoachondroplasia is caused by mutations in the gene encoding cartilage 
      oligomeric matrix protein (COMP). We looked for mutations in the COMP gene in 
      three sporadic Chinese pseudoachondroplasia patients and identified two novel 
      mutations, c.1189G>T (p.D397Y) and c.1220G>A (p.C407Y), and one recurrent 
      mutation, c.1318G>C (p.G440R), in the calcium binding type III repeats of COMP. 
      This study confirms the relationship between mutations of the COMP gene and 
      clinical findings of pseudoachondroplasia; it also provides evidence for the 
      importance of the calcium binding domains to the functioning of COMP.

TI  - SSRD: simple sequence repeats database of the human genome.
PG  - 342-5
LID - 10.1002/cfg.289 [doi]
AB  - Simple sequence repeats are predominantly found in most organisms. They play a 
      major role in studies of genetic diversity, and are useful as diagnostic markers 
      for many diseases. The simple sequence repeats database (SSRD) for the human 
      genome was created for easy access to such repeats, for analysis, and to be used 
      to understand their biological significance. The data includes the abundance and 
      distribution of SSRs in the coding and non-coding regions of the genome, as well 
      as their association with the UTRs of genes. The exact locations of repeats with 
      respect to genomic regions (such as UTRs, exons, introns or intergenic regions) 
      and their association with STS markers are also highlighted. The resource will 
      facilitate repeat sequence analysis in the human genome and the understanding of 
      the functional and evolutionary significance of simple sequence repeats. SSRD is 
      available through two websites, http://www.ccmb.res.in/ssr and 
      http://www.ingenovis.com/ssr.

TI  - Primary cilia are required for cerebellar development and Shh-dependent expansion 
      of progenitor pool.
PG  - 246-59
LID - 10.1016/j.ydbio.2008.02.026 [doi]
AB  - Cerebellar granule cell precursors (GCPs), which give rise to the most abundant 
      neuronal type in the mammalian brain, arise from a restricted pool of primary 
      progenitors in the rhombic lip (RL). Sonic hedgehog (Shh) secreted by developing 
      Purkinje cells is essential for the expansion of GCPs and for cerebellar 
      morphogenesis. Recent studies have shown that the primary cilium concentrates 
      components of Shh signaling and that this structure is required for Shh 
      signaling. GCPs have a primary cilium on their surface [Del Cerro, M.P., Snider, 
      R.S. (1972). Studies on the developing cerebellum. II. The ultrastructure of the 
      external granular layer. J Comp Neurol 144, 131-64.]. Here, we show that 1) this 
      cilium can be conditionally ablated by crossing Kif3a(fl/-) mice with hGFAP-Cre 
      mice, 2) removal of Kif3a from GCPs disrupts cerebellar development, and 3) these 
      defects are due to a drastic reduction in Shh-dependent expansion of GCPs. A 
      similar phenotype is observed when Smoothened (Smo), an essential transducer of 
      Shh signaling, is removed from the same population of GCPs. Interestingly, 
      Kif3a-Smo double conditional mutants show that Kif3a is epistatic to Smo. This 
      work shows that Kif3a is essential for Shh-dependent expansion of cerebellar 
      progenitors. Dysfunctional cilia are associated with diverse human disorders 
      including Bardet-Biedl and Joubert syndromes. Cerebellar abnormalities observed 
      in these patients could be explained by defects in Shh-induced GCP expansion.

TI  - Structure of a thrombospondin C-terminal fragment reveals a novel calcium core in 
      the type 3 repeats.
PG  - 1223-33
AB  - Thrombospondins (TSPs) are extracellular regulators of cell-matrix interactions 
      and cell phenotype. The most highly conserved region of all TSPs are the 
      calcium-binding type 3 (T3) repeats and the C-terminal globular domain (CTD). The 
      crystal structure of a cell-binding TSP-1 fragment, spanning three T3 repeats and 
      the CTD, reveals a compact assembly. The T3 repeats lack secondary structure and 
      are organised around a core of calcium ions; two DxDxDGxxDxxD motifs per repeat 
      each encapsulate two calcium ions in a novel arrangement. The CTD forms a 
      lectin-like beta-sandwich and contains four strictly conserved calcium-binding 
      sites. Disruption of the hairpin structure of T3 repeats 6 and 7 decreases 
      protein secretion and stability. The availability for cell attachment of an RGD 
      motif in T3 repeat 7 is modulated by calcium loading. The central architectural 
      role of calcium explains how it is critical for the functions of the TSP 
      C-terminal region. Mutations in the T3 repeats of TSP-5/COMP, which cause two 
      human skeletal disorders, are predicted to disrupt the tertiary structure of the 
      T3-CTD assembly.

TI  - Time course of early motor and neuropathological anomalies in a knock-in mouse 
      model of Huntington's disease with 140 CAG repeats.
PG  - 11-26
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by an abnormal expansion of CAG repeats in 
      the gene encoding huntingtin. The development of therapies for HD requires 
      preclinical testing of drugs in animal models that reproduce the dysfunction and 
      regionally specific pathology observed in HD. We have developed a new knock-in 
      mouse model of HD with a chimeric mouse/human exon 1 containing 140 CAG repeats 
      inserted in the murine huntingtin gene. These mice displayed an increased 
      locomotor activity and rearing at 1 month of age, followed by hypoactivity at 4 
      months and gait anomalies at 1 year. Behavioral symptoms preceded 
      neuropathological anomalies, which became intense and widespread only at 4 months 
      of age. These consisted of nuclear staining for huntingtin and 
      huntingtin-containing nuclear and neuropil aggregates that first appeared in the 
      striatum, nucleus accumbens, and olfactory tubercle. Interestingly, regions with 
      early pathology all receive dense dopaminergic inputs, supporting accumulating 
      evidence for a role of dopamine in HD pathology. Nuclear staining and aggregates 
      predominated in striatum and layer II/III and deep layer V of the cerebral 
      cortex, whereas neuropil aggregates were found in the globus pallidus and layer 
      IV/superficial layer V of the cerebral cortex. The olfactory system displayed 
      early and marked aggregate accumulation, which may be relevant to the early 
      deficit in odor discrimination observed in patients with HD. Because of their 
      early behavioral anomalies and regionally specific pathology, these mice provide 
      a powerful tool with which to evaluate the effectiveness of new therapies and to 
      study the mechanisms involved in the neuropathology of HD.

TI  - Autosomal dominant precocious osteoarthropathy due to a mutation of the cartilage 
      oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) gene: further expansion of the phenotypic 
      variations of COMP defects.
PG  - 730-7
AB  - We report on a Japanese family of four generations with an autosomal dominant 
      precocious osteoarthropathy. The cardinal clinical manifestations of affected 
      individuals were painful weight-bearing large joints, which started in late 
      childhood or adolescence. The radiological hallmarks included coxa plana, mild 
      epiphyseal dysplasia of the knee, and round talar domes with tibiotalar slant in 
      childhood, which evolved into degenerative joint diseases in adulthood. The 
      disease phenotype was cosegregated with a mutation of the cartilage oligomeric 
      matrix protein (COMP) gene in the family members, who underwent molecular 
      evaluation. COMP mutations have been reported in a mild form of multiple 
      epiphyseal dysplasia (MED), Ribbing type, as well as allied disorders with more 
      severe manifestations, such as MED Fairbank type and pseudoachondroplasia. Unlike 
      previously reported cases with the Ribbing type, the present patients did not 
      have short stature or brachydactyly. This report expands further the phenotypic 
      variations of COMP defects.

TI  - Nucleotide sequence and phylogenetic analysis of long terminal repeats of human 
      endogenous retrovirus K family (HERV-K) on human chromosomes.
PG  - 121-7
AB  - It has been suggested that human endogenous retroviruses K family (HERV-K) has a 
      role in disease, and solitary long terminal repeats (LTRs) of HERV-K have been 
      potentially capable of affecting the expression of closely located genes. Using 
      the human monochromosomes 8, 9, 17, and 18, with specific PCR primers, we 
      identified thirty-four sequences of new HERV-K LTRs. Those LTR elements were 
      analyzed phylogenetically with the human-specific HERV-K LTRs using 
      neighbor-joining and maximum parsimony methods. Clones HKL8-5, HKL9-5, and HKL9-8 
      are related by more than 99% homology with the human-specific HERV-K LTRs. The 
      HKL9-5 clone on chromosome 9 was 100% identical with the sequences of 
      human-specific LTR, AC002400, on chromosome 16. The findings suggest that there 
      has been recent proliferation, transposition, or chromosomal translocation of 
      HERV-K LTR elements on human chromosomes.

TI  - Trinucleotide expansion mutations in the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein 
      (COMP) gene.
PG  - 123-8
AB  - Pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH) and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED) are two 
      human autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasias characterized by variable short 
      stature, joint laxity and early-onset degenerative joint disease. Both disorders 
      can result from mut-ations in the gene for cartilage oligomeric matrix protein 
      (COMP), an extracellular matrix glycoprotein. About one-third of PSACH cases 
      result from heterozygosity for deletion of one codon within a very short triplet 
      repeat, (GAC)5, which encodes five consecutive aspartic acid residues within the 
      calmodulin-like region of the COMP protein. We have identified two expansion 
      mut-ations in this repeat: an MED patient carrying a (GAC)6allele and a PSACH 
      patient carrying a (GAC)7allele. These are among the shortest disease-causing 
      triplet repeat expansion mutations described thus far, and are the first 
      identified in a GAC repeat. A unique feature of this sequence is that expansion 
      as well as shortening of the repeat can cause the same disease. In cartilage, 
      both patients have rough endoplasmic reticulum inclusions in chondrocytes. The 
      inclusions are also present in tendon tissue and can be reproduced in cultured 
      tendon cells, suggesting that the pathophysiology of disease is similar in both 
      cartilage and tendon.
