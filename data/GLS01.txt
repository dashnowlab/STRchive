TI  - Frustration Between Preferred States of Complementary Trinucleotide Repeat DNA 
      Hairpins Anticorrelates with Expansion Disease Propensity.

AB  - DNA trinucleotide repeat (TRs) expansion beyond a threshold often results in 
      human neurodegenerative diseases. The mechanisms causing expansions remain 
      unknown, although the tendency of TR ssDNA to self-associate into hairpins that 
      slip along their length is widely presumed related. Here we apply single molecule 
      FRET (smFRET) experiments and molecular dynamics simulations to determine 
      conformational stabilities and slipping dynamics for CAG, CTG, GAC and GTC 
      hairpins. Tetraloops are favored in CAG (89%), CTG (89%) and GTC (69%) while GAC 
      favors triloops. We also determined that TTG interrupts near the loop in the CTG 
      hairpin stabilize the hairpin against slipping. The different loop stabilities 
      have implications for intermediate structures that may form when TR-containing 
      duplex DNA opens. Opposing hairpins in the (CAG) ... (CTG) duplex would have 
      matched stability whereas opposing hairpins in a (GAC) ... (GTC) duplex would have 
      unmatched stability, introducing frustration in the (GAC) ... (GTC) opposing 
      hairpins that could encourage their resolution to duplex DNA more rapidly than in 
      (CAG) ... (CTG) structures. Given that the CAG and CTG TR can undergo large, 
      disease-related expansion whereas the GAC and GTC sequences do not, these 
      stability differences can inform and constrain models of expansion mechanisms of 
      TR regions.

LID - 100070
AB  - It is unclear how the length of a repetitive DNA tract determines the onset and 
      progression of repeat expansion diseases, but the dynamics of secondary DNA 
      structures formed by repeat sequences are believed to play an important role. It 
      was recently shown that three-way DNA junctions containing slip-out hairpins of 
      CAG or CTG repeats and contiguous triplet repeats in the adjacent duplex 
      displayed single-molecule FRET (smFRET) dynamics that were ascribed to both local 
      conformational motions and longer-range branch migration. Here we explore these 
      so-called "mobile" slip-out structures through a detailed kinetic analysis of 
      smFRET trajectories and coarse-grained modeling. Despite the apparent structural 
      simplicity, with six FRET states resolvable, most smFRET states displayed 
      biexponential dwell-time distributions, attributed to structural heterogeneity 
      and overlapping FRET states. Coarse-grained modeling for a (GAC)(10) repeat 
      slip-out included trajectories that corresponded to a complete round of branch 
      migration; the structured free energy landscape between slippage events supports 
      the dynamical complexity observed by smFRET. A hairpin slip-out with 40 CAG 
      repeats, which is above the repeat length required for disease in several triplet 
      repeat disorders, displayed smFRET dwell times that were on average double those 
      of 3WJs with 10 repeats. The rate of secondary-structure rearrangement via branch 
      migration, relative to particular DNA processing pathways, may be an important 
      factor in the expansion of triplet repeat expansion diseases.

TI  - Repeat expansions nested within tandem CNVs: a unique structural change in GLS 
      exemplifies the diagnostic challenges of non-coding pathogenic variation.
PG  - 46-54
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddac173 [doi]
AB  - Glutaminase deficiency has recently been associated with ataxia and developmental 
      delay due to repeat expansions in the 5'UTR of the glutaminase (GLS) gene. 
      Patients with the described GLS repeat expansion may indeed remain undiagnosed 
      due to the rarity of this variant, the challenge of its detection and the recency 
      of its discovery. In this study, we combined advanced bioinformatics screening of 
      ~3000 genomes and ~1500 exomes with optical genome mapping and long-read 
      sequencing for confirmation studies. We identified two GLS families, previously 
      intensely and unsuccessfully analyzed. One family carries an unusual and complex 
      structural change involving a homozygous repeat expansion nested within a 
      quadruplication event in the 5'UTR of GLS. Glutaminase deficiency and its 
      metabolic consequences were validated by in-depth biochemical analysis. The 
      identified GLS patients showed progressive early-onset ataxia, cognitive 
      deficits, pyramidal tract damage and optic atrophy, thus demonstrating 
      susceptibility of several specific neuron populations to glutaminase deficiency. 
      This large-scale screening study demonstrates the ability of bioinformatics 
      analysis-validated by latest state-of-the-art technologies (optical genome 
      mapping and long-read sequencing)-to effectively flag complex repeat expansions 
      using short-read datasets and thus facilitate diagnosis of ultra-rare disorders.

LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-21-1204 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Glutamine is a critical fuel for solid tumors. Interference with 
      glutamine metabolism is deleterious to neoplasia in preclinical models. A phase I 
      study of the oral, first-in-class, glutaminase (GLS) inhibitor telaglenastat was 
      conducted in treatment-refractory solid tumor patients to define recommended 
      phase II dose (RP2D) and evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics 
      (PD), and antitumor activity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Dose escalation by 3 + 3 
      design was followed by exploratory tumor-/biomarker-specific cohorts. RESULTS: 
      Among 120 patients, fatigue (23%) and nausea (19%) were the most common toxicity. 
      Maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Correlative analysis indicated >90% GLS 
      inhibition in platelets at plasma exposures >300 nmol/L, >75% tumoral GLS 
      inhibition, and significant increase in circulating glutamine. RP2D was defined 
      at 800 mg twice-daily. Disease control rate (DCR) was 43% across expansion 
      cohorts (overall response rate 5%, DCR 50% in renal cell carcinoma). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Telaglenastat is safe, with a favorable PK/PD profile and signal of antitumor 
      activity, supporting further clinical development.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Smaller 8-mm diameter transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic 
      shunts (TIPS) appear to be more beneficial than larger 10-mm TIPS stent-grafts, 
      but lack the ability for secondary dilation in cases of clinical ineffectiveness. 
      Underdilated VIATORR(R) TIPS stent grafts (VTS) expand passively, whereas novel 
      VIATORR Controlled Expansion (VCX) stent grafts do not. This study evaluated the 
      impact on survival of underdilated VCX compared with VTS in patients with 
      decompensated cirrhosis. METHODS: This was a prospective case-control study 
      including patients with cirrhosis receiving TIPS using 10-mm VCX underdilated to 
      8 mm. Patients with cirrhosis receiving 10-mm VTS underdilated to 8 mm were 
      matched for age, sex, indication for TIPS, and liver function. RESULTS: A total 
      of 114 patients (47 VCX, 47 VTS, and 20 fully dilated VCX/VTS) were included. 
      After TIPS implantation, underdilated VCX diameter was 8.0 (7.8-9.2) mm at a 
      median time of 359 (87-450) days, compared with VTS at 9.9 (9.7-10.0) mm (p 
      <0.001). The portosystemic pressure gradient immediately after TIPS procedure and 
      after 7 days did not change significantly in VCX [mean 9.4 (+/- 0.8) vs. 10.4 (+/- 
      0.7) mmHg, p = 0.115). Hospital readmission rates for hepatic encephalopathy were 
      23% (n = 11) vs 51% (n = 24) for VCX and VTS (p <0.001), respectively. Patients 
      with VCX had significantly lower rates of large-volume paracentesis (n = 5 [11%] 
      vs. n = 10 [21%], p = 0.017) and heart failure (n = 1 [2%] vs. n = 7 [15%], p = 
      0.015). One-year mortality for underdilated VCX and VTS was 15% (n = 7) and 30% 
      (n = 14) and, for fully dilated VCX/VTS, was 45% (n = 9) (log-rank p = 0.008), 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that VCX stent grafts 
      underdilated to 8 mm do not passively expand to nominal diameter and suggests 
      reduced hospital readmissions because of hepatic encephalopathy, uncontrolled 
      ascites, and heart failure, and improved 1-year survival compared with 
      underdilated VTS. LAY SUMMARY: Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt 
      (TIPS) improves survival in selected patients with liver cirrhosis and acute 
      variceal bleeding or refractory ascites. Smaller 8-mm diameter TIPS stent grafts 
      appear to improve patient outcome compared with larger 10-mm diameter stent 
      grafts. Novel VIATORR(R) Controlled Expansion (VCX) stent grafts facilitate safe 
      and stable underdilation to 8 mm of large 10-mm diameter stent grafts with 
      improved patient outcome (survival, hepatic encephalopathy, ascites and heart 
      failure) compared with legacy VIATORR TIPS stent graft (VTS). Thus, the use of 
      underdilated VCX could preserve heart function. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: The 
      study is registered at Clinicaltrials.govNCT03628807.

TI  - Dose escalation and expansion (phase Ia/Ib) study of GLS-010, a recombinant fully 
      human antiprogrammed death-1 monoclonal antibody for advanced solid tumors or 
      lymphoma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: GLS-010, a novel engineered fully human immunoglobin G4 monoclonal 
      antibody, can specially block the PD-1/PD-L1/2 axis and reactivate the antitumor 
      immunity. AIM: This phase Ia/Ib study was carried out to evaluate the safety, 
      recommended phase II dose (R2PD), and primary antitumor effects of GLS-010 in 
      patients with advanced, refractory lymphoma and solid tumors. METHODS: In phase 
      Ia study, patients with refractory solid tumors and lymphoma enrolled and 
      received GLS-010 at a dose of 1, 4, or 10 mg/kg Q2W; 240 mg Q3W or Q2W. The 
      primary objective was to assess the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). In phase Ib 
      study, doses were expanded in 9 specific tumors to ensure the R2PD and explore 
      the efficacy. Tumor mutation burden level and PD-L1 expression were also assessed 
      with whole-exome sequencing and immunohistochemistry (SP263), respectively. 
      RESULTS: Up to April 18, 2020, a total of 289 patients (n = 24, phase Ia; 
      n = 265, phase Ib) were enrolled. DLT was not observed in phase Ia part. The 
      T(1/2), CL(ss), and V(d) were similar among all dose groups and different tumors. 
      The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were anemia, 
      leukopenia, elevated alanine aminotransaminase/asparate aminotransferase 
      (ALT/AST), and elevated bilirubin. And hypothyroidism was the most common 
      immune-related adverse event (irAE). The incidence of grade >/=3 TEAE was 39.8%, 
      while grade >/=3 irAE was only 4.5%. Based on safety studies, 
      pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and preclinical data, 240-mg Q2W was 
      recommended as the expansion dose. The overall objective response rate was 23.6%, 
      with 10 patients achieving complete response. Patients with a high PD-L1 
      expression level (31.3% Versus. 13.7%, p = 0.012) or t-issue tumor mutation 
      burden level (31.3% Versus. 5.6%, p = 0.009) showed a significantly better 
      response. CONCLUSION: GLS-010 showed acceptable safety profile and favorable 
      clinical response. The dose of 240 mg Q2W was an optimal recommended dose as 
      monotherapy.

TI  - Genome-wide survey of tandem repeats by nanopore sequencing shows that 
      disease-associated repeats are more polymorphic in the general population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tandem repeats are highly mutable and contribute to the development 
      of human disease by a variety of mechanisms. It is difficult to predict which 
      tandem repeats may cause a disease. One hypothesis is that changeable tandem 
      repeats are the source of genetic diseases, because disease-causing repeats are 
      polymorphic in healthy individuals. However, it is not clear whether 
      disease-causing repeats are more polymorphic than other repeats. METHODS: We 
      performed a genome-wide survey of the millions of human tandem repeats using 
      publicly available long read genome sequencing data from 21 humans. We measured 
      tandem repeat copy number changes using tandem-genotypes. Length variation of 
      known disease-associated repeats was compared to other repeat loci. RESULTS: We 
      found that known Mendelian disease-causing or disease-associated repeats, 
      especially CAG and 5'UTR GGC repeats, are relatively long and polymorphic in the 
      general population. We also show that repeat lengths of two disease-causing 
      tandem repeats, in ATXN3 and GLS, are correlated with near-by GWAS SNP genotypes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We provide a catalog of polymorphic tandem repeats across a variety 
      of repeat unit lengths and sequences, from long read sequencing data. This method 
      especially if used in genome wide association study, may indicate possible new 
      candidates of pathogenic or biologically important tandem repeats in human 
      genomes.

TI  - Glutaminase Deficiency Caused by Short Tandem Repeat Expansion in GLS.
PG  - 1433-1441
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa1806627 [doi]
AB  - We report an inborn error of metabolism caused by an expansion of a GCA-repeat 
      tract in the 5' untranslated region of the gene encoding glutaminase (GLS) that 
      was identified through detailed clinical and biochemical phenotyping, combined 
      with whole-genome sequencing. The expansion was observed in three unrelated 
      patients who presented with an early-onset delay in overall development, 
      progressive ataxia, and elevated levels of glutamine. In addition to ataxia, one 
      patient also showed cerebellar atrophy. The expansion was associated with a 
      relative deficiency of GLS messenger RNA transcribed from the expanded allele, 
      which probably resulted from repeat-mediated chromatin changes upstream of the 
      GLS repeat. Our discovery underscores the importance of careful examination of 
      regions of the genome that are typically excluded from or poorly captured by 
      exome sequencing.

TI  - Myricetin Reduces Toxic Level of CAG Repeats RNA in Huntington's Disease (HD) and 
      Spino Cerebellar Ataxia (SCAs).
PG  - 180-188
LID - 10.1021/acschembio.7b00699 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by 
      abnormal expansion of CAG repeats in the HTT gene. The transcribed mutant RNA 
      contains expanded CAG repeats that translate into a mutant huntingtin protein. 
      This expanded CAG repeat also causes mis-splicing of pre-mRNA due to 
      sequestration of muscle blind like-1 splicing factor (MBNL1), and thus both of 
      these elicit the pathogenesis of HD. Targeting the onset as well as progression 
      of HD by small molecules could be a potent therapeutic approach. We have screened 
      a set of small molecules to target this transcript and found Myricetin, a 
      flavonoid, as a lead molecule that interacts with the CAG motif and thus prevents 
      the translation of mutant huntingtin protein as well as sequestration of MBNL1. 
      Here, we report the first solution structure of the complex formed between 
      Myricetin and RNA containing the 5'CAG/3'GAC motif. Myricetin interacts with this 
      RNA via base stacking at the AA mismatch. Moreover, Myricetin was also found 
      reducing the proteo-toxicity generated due to the aggregation of polyglutamine, 
      and further, its supplementation also improves neurobehavioral deficits in the HD 
      mouse model. Our study provides the structural and mechanistic basis of Myricetin 
      as an effective therapeutic candidate for HD and other polyQ related disorders.

TI  - A B-Z junction induced by an A ... A mismatch in GAC repeats in the gene for 
      cartilage oligomeric matrix protein promotes binding with the hZalpha(ADAR1) protein.
PG  - 18732-18746
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M117.796235 [doi]
AB  - GAC repeat expansion from five to seven in the exonic region of the gene for 
      cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) leads to pseudoachondroplasia, a 
      skeletal abnormality. However, the molecular mechanism by which GAC expansions in 
      the COMP gene lead to skeletal dysplasias is poorly understood. Here we used 
      molecular dynamics simulations, which indicate that an A ... A mismatch in a 
      d(GAC)(6).d(GAC)(6) duplex induces negative supercoiling, leading to a local 
      B-to-Z DNA transition. This transition facilitates the binding of 
      d(GAC)(7).d(GAC)(7) with the Zalpha-binding domain of human adenosine deaminase 
      acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1, hZalpha(ADAR1)), as confirmed by CD, NMR, and microscale 
      thermophoresis studies. The CD results indicated that hZalpha(ADAR1) recognizes the 
      zigzag backbone of d(GAC)(7).d(GAC)(7) at the B-Z junction and subsequently 
      converts it into Z-DNA via the so-called passive mechanism. Molecular dynamics 
      simulations carried out for the modeled hZalpha(ADAR1)-d(GAC)(6)d(GAC)(6) complex 
      confirmed the retention of previously reported important interactions between the 
      two molecules. These findings suggest that hZalpha(ADAR1) binding with the GAC 
      hairpin stem in COMP can lead to a non-genetic, RNA editing-mediated substitution 
      in COMP that may then play a crucial role in the development of 
      pseudoachondroplasia.

AB  - CAG trinucleotide repeats are known to cause 10 late-onset progressive 
      neurodegenerative disorders as the repeats expand beyond a threshold, whereas GAC 
      repeats are associated with skeletal dysplasias and expand from the normal five 
      to a maximum of seven repeats. The TR secondary structure is believed to play a 
      role in CAG expansions. We have carried out free energy and molecular dynamics 
      studies to determine the preferred conformations of the A-A noncanonical pairs in 
      (CAG)(n) and (GAC)(n) trinucleotide repeats (n = 1, 4) and the consequent changes 
      in the overall structure of the RNA and DNA duplexes. We find that the global 
      free energy minimum corresponds to A-A pairs stacked inside the core of the helix 
      with anti-anti conformations in RNA and (high-anti)-(high-anti) conformations in 
      DNA. The next minimum corresponds to anti-syn conformations, whereas syn-syn 
      conformations are higher in energy. Transition rates of the A-A conformations are 
      higher for RNA than DNA. Mechanisms for these various transitions are identified. 
      Additional structural and dynamical aspects of the helical conformations are 
      explored, with a focus on contrasting CAG and GAC duplexes. The neutralizing ion 
      distribution around the noncanonical pairs is described.

AB  - Our objective was to search for mutations in genes SOD1, TARDBP, C9orf72, ANG, 
      ATXN2 and VEGF in Russian patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A 
      group of 208 Russian patients with ALS was examined. Molecular genetic analysis 
      was conducted using direct sequencing, fragment analysis, and real-time PCR. We 
      found eight different point mutations in the SOD1 gene, with the frequency of 
      mutations being 50% in familial ALS and 3% in sporadic ALS. No mutations were 
      found in exon 6 of the TARDBP gene; however, deletion c.715-126delG in intron 5 
      of TARDBP was over-represented in ALS patients compared to controls (38% vs. 
      26.6%; chi(2 )= 13.17; p = 0.002). Hexanucleotide repeat expansion of the C9orf72 
      gene was revealed in 2.5% of sporadic ALS patients. Mutations in the ANG gene 
      were identified in 1.5% of sporadic ALS patients. The presence of an intermediate 
      number (28-33) of GAC repeats in the ATXN2 gene was observed significantly more 
      often in the study group compared to the control group (5% vs. 1.7%; chi(2 )= 3.89; 
      p = 0.0486). In the cohort examined, we found an association between the disease 
      and the risk A-allele and the A/A genotype at the -2578capital ES, Cyrillic/capital A, Cyrillic locus of the VEGF 
      gene. In conclusion, we determined for the first time the genetic basis of ALS in 
      a Russian population.

TI  - Structural Insights Reveal the Dynamics of the Repeating r(CAG) Transcript Found 
      in Huntington's Disease (HD) and Spinocerebellar Ataxias (SCAs).

AB  - In humans, neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington's disease (HD) and many 
      spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) have been found to be associated with CAG 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion. An important RNA-mediated mechanism that causes 
      these diseases involves the binding of the splicing regulator protein MBNL1 
      (Muscleblind-like 1 protein) to expanded r(CAG) repeats. Moreover, mutant 
      huntingtin protein translated from expanded r(CAG) also yields toxic effects. To 
      discern the role of mutant RNA in these diseases, it is essential to gather 
      information about its structure. Detailed insight into the different structures 
      and conformations adopted by these mutant transcripts is vital for developing 
      therapeutics targeting them. Here, we report the crystal structure of an RNA 
      model with a r(CAG) motif, which is complemented by an NMR-based solution 
      structure obtained from restrained Molecular Dynamics (rMD) simulation studies. 
      Crystal structure data of the RNA model resolved at 2.3 A reveals non-canonical 
      pairing of adenine in 5 -CAG/3 -GAC motif samples in different syn and anti 
      conformations. The overall RNA structure has helical parameters intermediate to 
      the A- and B-forms of nucleic acids due to the global widening of major grooves 
      and base-pair preferences near internal AA loops. The comprehension of structural 
      behaviour by studying the spectral features and the dynamics also supports the 
      flexible nature of the r(CAG) motif.

TI  - Analysis of rapid maxillary expansion effects on nasal soft tissues widths.
PG  - 307-14
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to analyze the variations in nasal dimensions in 
      prepubertal patients associated with RME therapy compared with an untreated age 
      matched control group. METHODS: A group of 61 subjects (26 F, 35 M; mean age 
      10.5+/-1.8 years) was enrolled in the study to undergo a rapid maxillary expansion 
      therapy; 41 subjects (26 F, 15 M; mean age 10.7+/-2.2 years) were enrolled as a 
      control group. Both groups underwent nasal soft tissues width measurements using 
      a caliper at three separate time points: T0 - prior to the placement of RME; T1 - 
      after completion of active expansion phase; T2 - at the removal of the expander 
      (nearly 6 months after T1). RESULTS: The ANOVA showed statistically significant 
      increments (P<0.0001) of the greater alar cartilage (GAC) measurement (0.8+/-0.2 
      mm) in the study group, differences for the AB measurements were not 
      statistically significant (P=0.0784). CONCLUSION: The treatment of rapid 
      maxillary expansion can induce an increase in GAC soft tissues width of about 1 
      mm in prepubertal patients. This increase could not be considered of clinical 
      impact. The alar base width increase less than GAC, this increase is without 
      statistical significance.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) is a one of the major public health 
      problem that can lead to reflux esophagitis (RE), Barrett's esophagus (BE), and 
      esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). The aim of our study was to determine the impact 
      of IL-1 gene polymorphisms on the development of GERD, RE and BE. METHODS: Three 
      hundred and thirty-three Czech patients with gastroesophageal reflux and 165 
      healthy controls were included in this case-control study. Four polymorphisms in 
      the genes of the IL-1 cluster [IL-1A(-889C/T), IL-1B(-511C/T), IL-1B(+3953C/T), 
      and IL-1RN(VNTR)] were analyzed. RESULTS: Significant differences were found in 
      IL-1RN 1/2 genotype between patients with GERD/RE and controls and in IL-1B+3953 
      T allele between patients with BE and healthy subjects. In addition, complex 
      analysis revealed differences in IL-1 haplotype frequencies between the groups. 
      Specifically, the haplotype TCCL was significantly more frequent (p = 0.016) in 
      GERD patients than in controls and the haplotype CCCL more frequent (p = 0.008) 
      in RE patients than in controls. However, in patients with BE, frequency of 
      haplotype TCTL was lower (p = 0.05) and haplotypes CTCL and TCCL were higher (p = 
      0.03 and p = 0.02) in comparison with the controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our results 
      suggest that IL-1 haplotypes may be associated with susceptibility to GERD, RE 
      and BE.

AB  - Gastric cancer is the fourth most common cancer worldwide, with a high rate of 
      death and low 5-year survival rate. To date, there is a lack of efficient 
      therapeutic protocols for gastric cancer. Recent studies suggest that cancer stem 
      cells (CSCs) are responsible for tumor initiation, invasion, metastasis, and 
      resistance to anticancer therapies. Thus, therapies that target gastric CSCs are 
      attractive. However, CSCs in human gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) have not been 
      described. Here, we identify CSCs in tumor tissues and peripheral blood from GAC 
      patients. CSCs of human GAC (GCSCs) that are isolated from tumor tissues and 
      peripheral blood of patients carried CD44 and CD54 surface markers, generated 
      tumors that highly resemble the original human tumors when injected into 
      immunodeficient mice, differentiated into gastric epithelial cells in vitro, and 
      self-renewed in vivo and in vitro. Our findings suggest that effective 
      therapeutic protocols must target GCSCs. The capture of GCSCs from the 
      circulation of GAC patients also shows great potential for identification of a 
      critical cell population potentially responsible for tumor metastasis, and 
      provides an effective protocol for early diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring of 
      gastric cancer.

TI  - Changes in soft tissue nasal widths associated with rapid maxillary expansion in 
      prepubertal and postpubertal subjects.
PG  - 995-1001
LID - 10.2319/033110-179.1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate changes in the soft tissue width of the nose induced by 
      rapid maxillary expansion (RME). Data on greater alar cartilage (GAC) and alar 
      base (AB) widths were compared with a normative sample within the same age range. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study consisted of an RME sample of 79 
      patients treated with an RME protocol. Mean age at the start of RME treatment was 
      13.5 years; average duration of treatment was 6.7 months. Patients were grouped 
      into prepubertal and postpubertal groups based on their cervical vertebral 
      maturation (CVM) stage. AB and GAC widths were determined at three separate time 
      points. The normative sample consisted of 437 orthodontically untreated whites, 
      aged 10-16 years. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to 
      determine group differences. In addition, independent sample t-tests were used to 
      compare posttreatment nasal width values vs the untreated normative sample. 
      RESULTS: Increases in AB and GAC widths of the nose in the RME sample were less 
      than 1.5 mm. No significant differences were noted in width changes between the 
      prepubertal and postpubertal subgroups. Comparisons of T3 values showed that on 
      average nasal width increases were greater in the RME group than in untreated 
      norms by 1.7 mm for the GAC measure (statistically significant), and by less than 
      1 mm for the AB measure. CONCLUSIONS: RME has no significant clinical effects on 
      the widths of the apical base and the greater alar cartilage of the nose; no 
      differences were observed between the two maturational subgroups.

TI  - Two-triplet CGA repeats impede DNA replication in bacteriophage M13 in 
      Escherichia coli.
PG  - 97-102
AB  - Expansion and contraction instabilities associated with CAG, CGG, GAA and CGA 
      (GAC) repeats propagation cause more than a dozen human genetic diseases and 
      cancers. In this work, the propagation behavior of a bacteriophage M13 carrying a 
      calf prochymosin cDNA fragment with a (CGA)2 repeat in a small hairpin forming 
      region is reported. Such a M13 derivative when propagated in Escherichia coli, 
      produces small plaques by decreasing phage yield and also mitigates the 
      inhibition on host cell growth, compared to those control bacteriophages either 
      containing a "CTGCTA" sequence or wildtype, suggesting that CGA2 repeat impedes 
      DNA replication in vivo. Moreover, an increased internal free energy is found 
      associated with (CGA)2 sequence compared to those "CTGCTA" and wildtype, which 
      ruled out a possibility of CGA2 repeat effects on propagation is through 
      influencing the hairpin structure formation.

TI  - Pure red cell aplasia associated with expansion of CD3+ CD8+ granular lymphocytes 
      expressing cytotoxicity against HLA-E+ cells.
PG  - 147-53
AB  - T-cell granular lymphocyte-proliferative disorder (T-GLPD) is characterized by 
      the proliferation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and is often associated with pure 
      red cell aplasia (PRCA). The mechanism involved in the development of PRCA in 
      T-GLPD is unknown. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from 20 
      patients with T-GLPD. Ten patients had associated PRCA. Granular lymphocytes 
      (GLs) of T-GLPD are positive for CD94, but not NKG2A. To clarify the functional 
      role of CD94 in T-GLPD, we performed a cytotoxicity assay against the trophoblast 
      cell line, BeWo, which is known to express human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-E, a 
      natural ligand of CD94, and is deficient in other HLA class I and class II 
      antigens. GLs isolated from T-GLPD with PRCA patients killed BeWo cells more 
      significantly than GLs from T-GLPD without PRCA patients. Furthermore, GLs from 
      T-GLPD with PRCA were significantly stimulated by a monoclonal antibody against 
      CD94, whereas those of T-GLPD without PRCA were not. Taken together, HLA-E, a 
      ligand of CD94, was suggested to stimulate CD94+ cells to kill HLA-E+ cells in 
      T-GLPD with PRCA. GLs of T-GLPD with PRCA have a potential positive activity 
      against HLA-E+ cells, whereas GLs from T-GLPD without PRCA do not. CD94 may play 
      a key role in the pathogenesis of PRCA in T-GLPD.

TI  - Base stacking and even/odd behavior of hairpin loops in DNA triplet repeat 
      slippage and expansion with DNA polymerase.
PG  - 18382-90
AB  - Repetitions of CAG or CTG triplets in DNA can form intrastrand hairpin loops with 
      combinations of normal and mismatched base pairs that easily rearrange. Such 
      loops may promote primer-template slippage in DNA replication or repair to give 
      triplet-repeat expansions like those associated with neurodegenerative diseases. 
      Using self-priming sequences (e.g. (CAG)(16)(CTG)(4)), we resolve all hairpin 
      loops formed and measure their slippage and expansion rates with DNA polymerase 
      at 37 degrees C. Comparing CAG/CTG loop structures with GAC/GTC structures, 
      having similar hydrogen bonding but different base stacking, we find that CAG, 
      CTG, and GTC triplets predominantly form even-membered loops that slip in steps 
      of two triplets, whereas GAC triplets favor odd-numbered loops. Slippage rates 
      decline as hairpin stability increases, supporting the idea that slippage 
      initiates more easily in less stable regions. Loop stabilities (in low salt) 
      increase in the order GTC < CAG < GAC < CTG, while slippage rates decrease in the 
      order GTC > CAG approximately GAC > CTG. Loops of GTC compared with CTG melt 9 
      degrees C lower and slip 6-fold faster. We interpret results in terms of base 
      stacking, by relating melting temperature to standard enthalpy changes for 
      doublets of base pairs and mispairs, considering enthalpy-entropy compensation.

TI  - Genetic instabilities in (CTG.CAG) repeats occur by recombination.
PG  - 23468-79
AB  - The expansion of triplet repeat sequences (TRS) associated with hereditary 
      neurological diseases is believed from prior studies to be due to DNA 
      replication. This report demonstrates that the expansion of (CTG.CAG)(n) in vivo 
      also occurs by homologous recombination as shown by biochemical and genetic 
      studies. A two-plasmid recombination system was established in Escherichia coli 
      with derivatives of pUC19 (harboring the ampicillin resistance gene) and pACYC184 
      (harboring the tetracycline resistance gene). The derivatives contained various 
      triplet repeat inserts ((CTG.CAG), (CGG.CCG), (GAA.TTC), (GTC.GAC), and 
      (GTG.CAC)) of different lengths, orientations, and extents of interruptions and a 
      control non-repetitive sequence. The availability of the two drug resistance 
      genes and of several unique restriction sites on the plasmids enabled rigorous 
      genetic and biochemical analyses. The requirements for recombination at the TRS 
      include repeat lengths >30, the presence of CTG.CAG on both plasmids, and recA 
      and recBC. Sequence analyses on a number of DNA products isolated from individual 
      colonies directly demonstrated the crossing-over and expansion of the homologous 
      CTG.CAG regions. Furthermore, inversion products of the type 
      [(CTG)(13)(CAG)(67)].[(CTG)(67)(CAG)(13)] were isolated as the apparent result of 
      "illegitimate" recombination events on intrahelical pseudoknots. This work 
      establishes the relationships between CTG.CAG sequences, multiple fold 
      expansions, genetic recombination, formation of new recombinant DNA products, and 
      the presence of both drug resistance genes. Thus, if these reactions occur in 
      humans, unequal crossing-over or gene conversion may also contribute to the 
      expansions responsible for anticipation associated with several hereditary 
      neurological syndromes.

AB  - Pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH) and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED) are two 
      human autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasias characterized by variable short 
      stature, joint laxity and early-onset degenerative joint disease. Both disorders 
      can result from mut-ations in the gene for cartilage oligomeric matrix protein 
      (COMP), an extracellular matrix glycoprotein. About one-third of PSACH cases 
      result from heterozygosity for deletion of one codon within a very short triplet 
      repeat, (GAC)5, which encodes five consecutive aspartic acid residues within the 
      calmodulin-like region of the COMP protein. We have identified two expansion 
      mut-ations in this repeat: an MED patient carrying a (GAC)6allele and a PSACH 
      patient carrying a (GAC)7allele. These are among the shortest disease-causing 
      triplet repeat expansion mutations described thus far, and are the first 
      identified in a GAC repeat. A unique feature of this sequence is that expansion 
      as well as shortening of the repeat can cause the same disease. In cartilage, 
      both patients have rough endoplasmic reticulum inclusions in chondrocytes. The 
      inclusions are also present in tendon tissue and can be reproduced in cultured 
      tendon cells, suggesting that the pathophysiology of disease is similar in both 
      cartilage and tendon.

TI  - Expansion of CTG repeats from human disease genes is dependent upon replication 
      mechanisms in Escherichia coli: the effect of long patch mismatch repair 
      revisited.
PG  - 1101-10
AB  - Many human hereditary disease genes have been recently associated with the 
      expansion of CTG/GAC repeats. We have used a plasmid-based assay in Escherichia 
      coli to investigate the instability of a (CTG/GAC) insert containing 64 repeats. 
      Using this assay, expansions were biochemically detected and subsequently 
      quantified. We show that the occurence of expansions within these trinucleotide 
      repeats is dependent upon replicative mechanisms. Expansions of up to 30 repeats 
      and deletions of almost all possible sizes occured regardless of the orientation 
      of the insert relative to the replication origin. In contradiction to a previous 
      report, the mismatch repair pathway was found to strongly stabilize these repeat 
      stretches.

TI  - Evidence for two preferred hairpin folding patterns in d(CGG).d(CCG) repeat 
      tracts in vivo.
PG  - 17-23
AB  - Unusual DNA secondary structures have been implicated in the expansion of 
      trinucleotide repeat tracts that has been found to be responsible for a growing 
      number of human inherited disorders and folate-sensitive fragile chromosome 
      sites. By inserting trinucleotide repeat sequences into a palindromic clamp in 
      lambda phage we are able to investigate their tendencies to form hairpins in vivo 
      in any particular alignment and with odd or even numbers of repeat units in the 
      hairpin. We previously showed that with d(CAG).d(CTG) repeat tracts there was a 
      markedly greater tendency to form hairpins with even numbers of repeat units than 
      with odd numbers, whereas d(GAC).d(GTC) repeats showed no such alternation 
      despite having the same base composition. We expected that d(CGG).d(CCG) repeats, 
      might show the same pattern as d(CAG).(CTG) repeats since they are also involved 
      in trinucleotide repeat expansion disorders. The pattern was not so clear and we 
      wondered whether this might be because d(CGG).d(CCG) repeats have more than one 
      possible alignment in which they could self-anneal. We now present results for 
      all three alignments, which suggest that while even-membered hairpins are 
      preferred in the frame d(CGG).d(CCG), hairpins with odd numbers of trinucleotides 
      are more stable in the frame d(GGC).d(GCC). In both cases the base-pair predicted 
      to close the terminal loop of unpaired bases is 5'C.3'G which has previously been 
      found to be a favoured loop-closing pair.

TI  - Hairpin formation during DNA synthesis primer realignment in vitro in triplet 
      repeat sequences from human hereditary disease genes.
PG  - 16798-806
AB  - Genetic expansion of DNA triplet repeat sequences (TRS) found in neurogenetic 
      disorders may be due to abnormal DNA replication. We have previously observed 
      strong DNA synthesis pausings at specific loci within the long tracts (> 
      approximately 70 repeats) of CTG.CAG and CGG.CCG as well as GTC.GAC by primer 
      extensions in vitro using DNA polymerases (the Klenow fragment of Escherichia 
      coli DNA polymerase I, the modified T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase), and human DNA 
      polymerase beta). Herein, we have isolated and analyzed the products of stalled 
      synthesis found at approximately 30-40 triplets from the beginning of the TRS. 
      DNA sequence analyses revealed that the stalled products contained short tracts 
      of homogeneous TRS (6-12 repeats) in the middle of the sequence corresponding to 
      the flanking region of the primer-template sequence. The sequence at the 3'-side 
      terminated at the end of the primer, indicating that the primer molecule had 
      served as a template. In addition, chemical probe and polyacrylamide gel 
      electrophoretic analyses revealed that the stalled products existed in hairpin 
      structures. We postulate that these products of the DNA polymerases are caused by 
      the existence of an unusual DNA conformation(s) within the TRS, during the in 
      vitro DNA synthesis, enhancing the DNA slippages and the hairpin formations in 
      the TRS due to primer realignment. The consequence of these steps is DNA 
      synthesis to the end of the primer and termination. Primer realignment including 
      hairpin formation may play an important intermediate role in the replication of 
      TRS in vivo to elicit genetic expansions.

TI  - Genetically unstable CXG repeats are structurally dynamic and have a high 
      propensity for folding. An NMR and UV spectroscopic study.
PG  - 323-36
AB  - Recent molecular genetics studies have revealed a correlation between 
      spontaneous, progressive expansion of several DNA trinucleotide repeats and 
      certain hereditary neurodegenerative diseases. Triplet repeat (TR) sequences may 
      be present in structured forms that can mediate the processes interrupting normal 
      cellular replication, transcription, or repair activities, eventually leading to 
      gene mutation. Using high resolution NMR spectroscopy and other biophysical 
      methods, we probed the solution structures and properties of single-stranded TR 
      sequences. These studies have led to the discovery of a new duplex motif 
      (e-motif), present in CCG repeats, and to the elucidation of the structure of the 
      (CTG)3 duplex. In this paper we provide a global picture of the solution behavior 
      of the human disease-related CXG (X = A, C, G, or T) and the comparison GXC (X = 
      A, or T) TR sequences. All six triplet repeats form antiparallel duplexes. The 
      mismatched bases in CAG and CGG repeat duplexes are rather flexible and they do 
      not appear to form stable, paired conformations. By comparison, GAC repeat 
      duplexes and their mismatched A residues are well-structured. Most interestingly, 
      the structures of the disease-related CXG repeats exhibit a propensity for 
      folding at chain lengths as short as 12 residues. Furthermore, the energy barrier 
      for the formation of homo-duplexes from the corresponding complementary 
      hetero-duplexes are much lower for the CXG TR sequences than for the GAC or GTC 
      TR sequences. These results provide insights into the conformation and 
      physiochemical properties of TR sequences. Thus, a basis is provided for further 
      studies of the behavior of long TR sequences in an effort to elucidate the 
      molecular mechanisms of in vivo expansion and function of TR sequences.

TI  - Stability of intrastrand hairpin structures formed by the CAG/CTG class of DNA 
      triplet repeats associated with neurological diseases.
PG  - 1992-8
AB  - Expansions of trinucleotide repeats in DNA, a novel source of mutations 
      associated with human disease, may arise by DNA replication slippage initiated by 
      hairpin folding of primer or template strands containing such repeats. To 
      evaluate the stability of single-strand folding by repeating triplets of DNA 
      bases, thermal melting profiles of (CAG)10, (CTG)10, (GAC)10 and (GTC)10 strands 
      are determined at low and physiological salt concentrations, and measurements of 
      melting temperature and enthalpy change are made in each case. Comparisons are 
      made to strands with three times as many repeats, (CAG)30 and (CTG)30. Evidence 
      is presented for stable intrastrand folding by the CAG/CTG class of triplet 
      repeats. Relative to the GAC/GTC class not associated with disease, the order of 
      folding stability is found to be CTG > GAC approximately = CAG > GTC for 10 
      repeats. Surprisingly, the folds formed by 30 repeats of CTG or CAG have no 
      higher melting temperature and are only 40% more stable in free energy than those 
      formed by 10 repeats. This finding suggests that triplet expansions with higher 
      repeat number may result from the formation of more folded structures with 
      similar stability rather than fewer but longer folds of greater stability.

TI  - The effects of trinucleotide repeats found in human inherited disorders on 
      palindrome inviability in Escherichia coli suggest hairpin folding preferences in 
      vivo.
PG  - 825-32
AB  - Unusual DNA secondary structures have been implicated in the expansion of 
      trinucleotide repeat tracts that are associated with several human inherited 
      disorders. We present evidence consistent with the folding of these trinucleotide 
      repeats into hairpin loops at the center of a long DNA palindrome in vivo. Our 
      assay utilizes a palindrome in bacteriophage lambda, the center of which 
      determines its ability to inhibit plaque formation in a manner that is consistent 
      with folding into a hairpin or cruciform structure. We show that central inserts 
      of even numbers of d(CAG).d(CTG) repeats inhibit plaque formation more than do 
      odd numbers. Both d(CAG)2.d(CTG)2 and d(CGG)2.d(CCG)2 central sequences behave 
      like DNA sequences known to form two-base loops in vitro, suggesting that they 
      may also form compact and stable loops. By contrast, repeats of d(GAC).d(GTC) do 
      not show any evidence consistent with unusual loop stability. These results agree 
      with in vitro evidence that the unstable repeats can form hairpin secondary 
      structures and suggest a favored position of folding. We discuss the potential 
      roles of secondary structures, DNA replication and recombination in models of 
      repeat tract expansion.

TI  - Isolation of a cDNA clone encoding a KATP channel-like protein expressed in 
      insulin-secreting cells, localization of the human gene to chromosome band 
      21q22.1, and linkage studies with NIDDM.

AB  - The metabolism of glucose in insulin-secreting cells leads to closure of 
      ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP), an event that initiates the insulin secretory 
      process. Defects in insulin secretion are a common feature of 
      non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and the beta-cell KATP that 
      couples metabolism and membrane potential is a candidate for contributing to the 
      development of this clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder. We 
      screened a hamster insulinoma cDNA library by low-stringency hybridization with a 
      probe coding for the G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ channel GIRK1/KGA 
      and isolated clones encoding a protein, KATP-2, whose sequence is 90% similar to 
      that of the recently described KATP-1, an ATP-sensitive K+ channel expressed in 
      heart and other tissues. RNA blotting showed that KATP mRNA was present in 
      insulin-secreting cells and brain but not in heart. To assess the contribution of 
      KATP-2 to the development of NIDDM, the human KATP-2 gene (symbol KCNJ7) was 
      isolated and mapped to chromosome band 21q22.1 by fluorescence in situ 
      hybridization. A simple tandem repeat DNA polymorphism, D21S1255, was identified 
      in the region of the KATP-2 gene, and linkage studies between this marker and 
      NIDDM were carried out in a group of Mexican-American sib pairs with NIDDM. There 
      was no evidence for linkage between D21S1255 and NIDDM, indicating that KATP-2 is 
      not a major susceptibility gene in this population.
