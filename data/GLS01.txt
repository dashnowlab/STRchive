TI  - Repeat expansions nested within tandem CNVs: a unique structural change in GLS 
      exemplifies the diagnostic challenges of non-coding pathogenic variation.
PG  - 46-54
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddac173 [doi]
AB  - Glutaminase deficiency has recently been associated with ataxia and developmental 
      delay due to repeat expansions in the 5'UTR of the glutaminase (GLS) gene. 
      Patients with the described GLS repeat expansion may indeed remain undiagnosed 
      due to the rarity of this variant, the challenge of its detection and the recency 
      of its discovery. In this study, we combined advanced bioinformatics screening of 
      ~3000 genomes and ~1500 exomes with optical genome mapping and long-read 
      sequencing for confirmation studies. We identified two GLS families, previously 
      intensely and unsuccessfully analyzed. One family carries an unusual and complex 
      structural change involving a homozygous repeat expansion nested within a 
      quadruplication event in the 5'UTR of GLS. Glutaminase deficiency and its 
      metabolic consequences were validated by in-depth biochemical analysis. The 
      identified GLS patients showed progressive early-onset ataxia, cognitive 
      deficits, pyramidal tract damage and optic atrophy, thus demonstrating 
      susceptibility of several specific neuron populations to glutaminase deficiency. 
      This large-scale screening study demonstrates the ability of bioinformatics 
      analysis-validated by latest state-of-the-art technologies (optical genome 
      mapping and long-read sequencing)-to effectively flag complex repeat expansions 
      using short-read datasets and thus facilitate diagnosis of ultra-rare disorders.

TI  - Genome-wide survey of tandem repeats by nanopore sequencing shows that 
      disease-associated repeats are more polymorphic in the general population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tandem repeats are highly mutable and contribute to the development 
      of human disease by a variety of mechanisms. It is difficult to predict which 
      tandem repeats may cause a disease. One hypothesis is that changeable tandem 
      repeats are the source of genetic diseases, because disease-causing repeats are 
      polymorphic in healthy individuals. However, it is not clear whether 
      disease-causing repeats are more polymorphic than other repeats. METHODS: We 
      performed a genome-wide survey of the millions of human tandem repeats using 
      publicly available long read genome sequencing data from 21 humans. We measured 
      tandem repeat copy number changes using tandem-genotypes. Length variation of 
      known disease-associated repeats was compared to other repeat loci. RESULTS: We 
      found that known Mendelian disease-causing or disease-associated repeats, 
      especially CAG and 5'UTR GGC repeats, are relatively long and polymorphic in the 
      general population. We also show that repeat lengths of two disease-causing 
      tandem repeats, in ATXN3 and GLS, are correlated with near-by GWAS SNP genotypes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We provide a catalog of polymorphic tandem repeats across a variety 
      of repeat unit lengths and sequences, from long read sequencing data. This method 
      especially if used in genome wide association study, may indicate possible new 
      candidates of pathogenic or biologically important tandem repeats in human 
      genomes.

TI  - Glutaminase Deficiency Caused by Short Tandem Repeat Expansion in GLS.
PG  - 1433-1441
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa1806627 [doi]
AB  - We report an inborn error of metabolism caused by an expansion of a GCA-repeat 
      tract in the 5' untranslated region of the gene encoding glutaminase (GLS) that 
      was identified through detailed clinical and biochemical phenotyping, combined 
      with whole-genome sequencing. The expansion was observed in three unrelated 
      patients who presented with an early-onset delay in overall development, 
      progressive ataxia, and elevated levels of glutamine. In addition to ataxia, one 
      patient also showed cerebellar atrophy. The expansion was associated with a 
      relative deficiency of GLS messenger RNA transcribed from the expanded allele, 
      which probably resulted from repeat-mediated chromatin changes upstream of the 
      GLS repeat. Our discovery underscores the importance of careful examination of 
      regions of the genome that are typically excluded from or poorly captured by 
      exome sequencing.

TI  - Isolation of a cDNA clone encoding a KATP channel-like protein expressed in 
      insulin-secreting cells, localization of the human gene to chromosome band 
      21q22.1, and linkage studies with NIDDM.
PG  - 592-6
AB  - The metabolism of glucose in insulin-secreting cells leads to closure of 
      ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP), an event that initiates the insulin secretory 
      process. Defects in insulin secretion are a common feature of 
      non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and the beta-cell KATP that 
      couples metabolism and membrane potential is a candidate for contributing to the 
      development of this clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder. We 
      screened a hamster insulinoma cDNA library by low-stringency hybridization with a 
      probe coding for the G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ channel GIRK1/KGA 
      and isolated clones encoding a protein, KATP-2, whose sequence is 90% similar to 
      that of the recently described KATP-1, an ATP-sensitive K+ channel expressed in 
      heart and other tissues. RNA blotting showed that KATP mRNA was present in 
      insulin-secreting cells and brain but not in heart. To assess the contribution of 
      KATP-2 to the development of NIDDM, the human KATP-2 gene (symbol KCNJ7) was 
      isolated and mapped to chromosome band 21q22.1 by fluorescence in situ 
      hybridization. A simple tandem repeat DNA polymorphism, D21S1255, was identified 
      in the region of the KATP-2 gene, and linkage studies between this marker and 
      NIDDM were carried out in a group of Mexican-American sib pairs with NIDDM. There 
      was no evidence for linkage between D21S1255 and NIDDM, indicating that KATP-2 is 
      not a major susceptibility gene in this population.
