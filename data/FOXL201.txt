TI  - The combination of polyalanine expansion mutation and a novel missense 
      substitution in transcription factor FOXL2 leads to different ovarian phenotypes 
      in blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) patients.

AB  - STUDY QUESTION: What are the implications of multiple alterations of the forkhead 
      box L2 (FOXL2) gene in blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome 
      (BPES) patients? SUMMARY ANSWER: A multi-mutation of FOXL2, consisting of the 
      expansion of the polyalanine tract from 14 to 24 residues (FOXL2-Ala24), an novel 
      Y186C substitution from c.557A>G, and a synonymous variant (c.505G>A), had a 
      cumulative effect on ovarian phenotypes in BPES patients. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: 
      Mutations in FOXL2, a gene encoding a forkhead transcription factor cause BPES. 
      Overall, the expansion of the polyalanine tract of FOXL2 from 14 to 24 residues 
      (FOXL2-Ala24) accounts for 30% of intragenic mutations. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, 
      DURATION: In this study, patients from seven BPES families and six sporadic cases 
      were included. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: We conducted an 
      extensive clinical, hormonal and functional study in 20 patients carrying the 
      expansion of the polyalanine tract of FOXL2 associated with BPES. A 
      multi-mutation of FOXL2 was detected in one BPES family that showed more severe 
      BPES symptoms. Subcellular localization and transactivation studies were 
      performed for the constructs of FOXL2-Ala24, Y186C and FOXL2-Ala24-Y186C. MAIN 
      RESULTS: We described the first multi-mutation of FOXL2 (c. [672_701dup30; 
      557A>G]) that leads to the polyalanine expansion of +10 residues (FOXL2-Ala24) 
      combined with an Y186C substitution and a synonymous variant in a Chinese BPES 
      family. This multi-mutation genotype was associated with more serious BPES 
      clinical manifestations and the development of esotropia in the right eye. In in 
      vitro studies, the multi-mutation affected the function of FOKL2 on the StAR 
      promoter and DK3, and induced more aggressive aggregation and mislocalization of 
      FOXL2 protein. The synonymous variant, while not affecting amino acid coding, 
      causes a change in the RNA stem-loop structure. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: 
      The multi-mutation of FOXL2 was detected in one BPES family and it needs to be 
      validated further by more BPES subjects. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The 
      results of our study contribute new insights into the research field of BPES 
      caused by the multi-mutation of FOXL2. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: This 
      study was supported by Shanghai Leading Academic Discipline Project (Grant number 
      S30205) and Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine Doctor Innovation 
      Fund (Grant number 201131). The authors have no competing interests to declare.

TI  - Differential aggregation and functional impairment induced by polyalanine 
      expansions in FOXL2, a transcription factor involved in cranio-facial and ovarian 
      development.
PG  - 1010-9
AB  - Polyalanine (polyAla) tract expansions have been associated with an increasing 
      number of human diseases. Here, we have undertaken a functional study of the 
      effects of polyAla expansions in the context of the transcription factor FOXL2, 
      involved in cranio-facial and ovarian development. Using two cellular models, we 
      show that FOXL2 polyAla expansions lead to protein mislocalization and 
      aggregation in a length-dependent manner. The fraction of cells containing 
      cytoplasmic staining displays a sigmoidal relationship with respect to the length 
      of the polyAla tract, suggesting the existence of a threshold length above which 
      protein mislocalization occurs. The existence of such a threshold might be 
      rationalized if we consider that the longer the polyAla tract is, the higher its 
      tendency to misfolding or to inducing spurious interactions with cytoplasmic 
      components. To study the intranuclear dynamics of polyAla-expanded FOXL2, we 
      performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments. The most 
      unexpected result concerned the pathogenic protein containing 19 Ala residues in 
      the run, which was virtually immobile, although this variant does not present a 
      classical aggregation pattern. Luciferase assays and real time RT-PCR of many 
      potential target genes showed that polyAla expansions induce different losses of 
      activity according to the target promoters tested. We provide molecular 
      explanations for these findings. Although our main focus is the mechanisms of 
      pathogenesis of polyAla-expanded proteins, we discuss the potential relevance of 
      polyAla length variation in micro- and macroevolution because polyAla-containing 
      proteins tend to be transcription factors.

TI  - A novel polyalanine expansion in FOXL2: the first evidence for a recessive form 
      of the blepharophimosis syndrome (BPES) associated with ovarian dysfunction.
PG  - 107-12
AB  - The blepharophimosis syndrome (BPES) is an autosomal dominant developmental 
      disorder in which craniofacial/eyelid malformations are associated (type I) or 
      not (type II) with premature ovarian failure (POF). Mutations in the FOXL2 gene, 
      encoding a forkhead transcription factor, are responsible for both types of BPES. 
      Heterozygous polyalanine expansions of +10 residues (FOXL2-Ala24) account for 30% 
      of FOXL2 mutations and are fully penetrant for the eyelid phenotype. Here we 
      describe the first homozygous FOXL2 mutation leading to a polyalanine expansion 
      of +5 residues (FOXL2-Ala19). This novel mutation segregates in an Indian family 
      where heterozygous mutation carriers are unaffected whereas homozygous 
      individuals have the typical BPES phenotype, with proven POF in one female. 
      Expression of the FOXL2-Ala19 protein in COS-7 cells revealed a significantly 
      higher cytoplasmic retention compared to the wild-type protein. This is the first 
      study providing genetic evidence for a recessive inheritance of BPES associated 
      with ovarian dysfunction.

TI  - A recurrent polyalanine expansion in the transcription factor FOXL2 induces 
      extensive nuclear and cytoplasmic protein aggregation.
PG  - 932-6
AB  - Blepharophimosis syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease characterised by 
      eyelid malformations, associated or not with premature ovarian failure. It is 
      caused by mutations in the FOXL2 gene, which encodes a forkhead transcription 
      factor containing a polyalanine (polyAla) domain of 14 alanines. Expansions of 
      the polyAla tract from 14 to 24 residues account for 30% of the reported 
      mutations and lead mainly to isolated palpebral defects. We have transfected 
      COS-7 cells with DNA constructs driving the expression of the wildtype and mutant 
      FOXL2 proteins fused to the green fluorescent protein. The polyAla expansion was 
      found to induce the formation of intranuclear aggregates and a mislocalisation of 
      the protein due to extensive cytoplasmic aggregation. These findings were 
      confirmed by immunofluorescence. Co-transfection experiments suggest that the 
      wildtype and mutant proteins can co-aggregate. We propose that the mechanism for 
      the molecular pathogenesis of the polyAla expansions of FOXL2 may be its 
      mislocalisation concomitant with its inclusion into nuclear aggregates. This may 
      diminish the pool of active protein. Potential effects of aggregation on cell 
      viability are under study.

TI  - Definition of the blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus syndrome critical 
      region at chromosome 3q23 based on the analysis of chromosomal anomalies.
PG  - 963-7
AB  - Blepharophimosis syndrome (BPES) is an autosomal dominant disorder of 
      craniofacial development, the features of which are small palpebral fissures 
      (blepharophimosis), drooping eyelids (ptosis) and a skin fold arising from the 
      lower eyelid (epicanthus inversus). The chromosomal localization and identity of 
      the BPES locus is not known with certainty. In the current paper, DNA samples 
      from three individuals with a clinical history of BPES, two with interstitial 
      deletions (cases 1 and 2) and one with a balanced translocation (case 3) all 
      involving chromosome 3q23, were analyzed. Allele loss studies using short tandem 
      repeat markers in cases 1 and 2 suggested that the region between the markers 
      D3S1292 and D3S1306 was deleted in both cases. Subsequently, the derived 
      chromosomes resulting from the translocation in case 3 were segregated in 
      interspecific somatic cell hybrids. Analysis of the resultant hybrids showed that 
      D3S1615 was retained in the derived chromosome 3, whereas D3S1316 was retained in 
      the derived chromosome 4. In neither case was the marker present in the 
      reciprocal hybrid. These results indicate that the BPES critical region lies in 
      the D3S1615-D3S1316 interval.
