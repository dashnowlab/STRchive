TI  - Definition of the blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus syndrome critical 
      region at chromosome 3q23 based on the analysis of chromosomal anomalies.
PG  - 963-7
AB  - Blepharophimosis syndrome (BPES) is an autosomal dominant disorder of 
      craniofacial development, the features of which are small palpebral fissures 
      (blepharophimosis), drooping eyelids (ptosis) and a skin fold arising from the 
      lower eyelid (epicanthus inversus). The chromosomal localization and identity of 
      the BPES locus is not known with certainty. In the current paper, DNA samples 
      from three individuals with a clinical history of BPES, two with interstitial 
      deletions (cases 1 and 2) and one with a balanced translocation (case 3) all 
      involving chromosome 3q23, were analyzed. Allele loss studies using short tandem 
      repeat markers in cases 1 and 2 suggested that the region between the markers 
      D3S1292 and D3S1306 was deleted in both cases. Subsequently, the derived 
      chromosomes resulting from the translocation in case 3 were segregated in 
      interspecific somatic cell hybrids. Analysis of the resultant hybrids showed that 
      D3S1615 was retained in the derived chromosome 3, whereas D3S1316 was retained in 
      the derived chromosome 4. In neither case was the marker present in the 
      reciprocal hybrid. These results indicate that the BPES critical region lies in 
      the D3S1615-D3S1316 interval.
