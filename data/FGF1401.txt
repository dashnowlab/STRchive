TI  - RFC1 repeat expansions in downbeat nystagmus syndromes: frequency and phenotypic 
      profile.
LID - 10.1007/s00415-024-12229-z [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The cause of downbeat nystagmus (DBN) remains unknown in a 
      substantial number of patients ("idiopathic"), although intronic GAA expansions 
      in FGF14 have recently been shown to account for almost 50% of yet idiopathic 
      cases. Here, we hypothesized that biallelic RFC1 expansions may also represent a 
      recurrent cause of DBN syndrome. METHODS: We genotyped the RFC1 repeat and 
      performed in-depth phenotyping in 203 patients with DBN, including 65 patients 
      with idiopathic DBN, 102 patients carrying an FGF14 GAA expansion, and 36 
      patients with presumed secondary DBN. RESULTS: Biallelic RFC1 AAGGG expansions 
      were identified in 15/65 patients with idiopathic DBN (23%). None of the 102 
      GAA-FGF14-positive patients, but 2/36 (6%) of patients with presumed secondary 
      DBN carried biallelic RFC1 expansions. The DBN syndrome in RFC1-positive patients 
      was characterized by additional cerebellar impairment in 100% (15/15), bilateral 
      vestibulopathy (BVP) in 100% (15/15), and polyneuropathy in 80% (12/15) of cases. 
      Compared to GAA-FGF14-positive and genetically unexplained patients, 
      RFC1-positive patients had significantly more frequent neuropathic features on 
      examination and BVP. Furthermore, vestibular function, as measured by the video 
      head impulse test, was significantly more impaired in RFC1-positive patients. 
      DISCUSSION: Biallelic RFC1 expansions are a common monogenic cause of DBN 
      syndrome.

TI  - The FGF14 GAA repeat expansion in Greek patients with late-onset cerebellar 
      ataxia and an overview of the SCA27B phenotype across populations.
LID - 10.1111/cge.14482 [doi]
AB  - A pathogenic GAA repeat expansion in the first intron of the fibroblast growth 
      factor 14 gene (FGF14) has been recently identified as the cause of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia 27B (SCA27B). We herein screened 160 Greek index cases 
      with late-onset cerebellar ataxia (LOCA) for FGF14 repeat expansions using a 
      combination of long-range PCR and bidirectional repeat-primed PCRs. We identified 
      19 index cases (12%) carrying a pathogenic FGF14 GAA expansion, a diagnostic 
      yield higher than that of previously screened repeat-expansion ataxias in Greek 
      LOCA patients. The age at onset of SCA27B patients was 60.5 +/- 12.3 years (range, 
      34-80). Episodic onset (37%), downbeat nystagmus (32%) and vertigo (26%) were 
      significantly more frequent in FGF14 expansion-positive cases compared to 
      expansion-negative cases. Beyond typical cerebellar signs, SCA27B patients often 
      displayed hyperreflexia (47%) and reduced vibration sense in the lower 
      extremities (42%). The frequency and phenotypic profile of SCA27B in Greek 
      patients was similar to most other previously studied populations. We conclude 
      that FGF14 GAA repeat expansions are the commonest known genetic cause of LOCA in 
      the Greek population and recommend prioritizing testing for FGF14 expansions in 
      the diagnostic algorithm of patients with LOCA.

TI  - Paroxysmal Ataxia: A Characteristic Feature of FGF14 Repeat Expansion (SCA27B).
PG  - e200118

LID - e200118
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Paroxysmal ataxia is typically characterized by early-onset attacks 
      of cerebellar ataxia. Late-onset cerebellar ataxia (LOCA) comprises a group of 
      neurodegenerative disorders mainly characterized by adult-onset progressive 
      cerebellar ataxia. A deep intronic expansion of a GAA triplet in the FGF14 gene 
      encoding fibroblast growth factor 14 has recently been identified as a frequent 
      cause of LOCA. METHODS: We describe a patient with paroxysmal ataxia/dysarthria 
      due to a FGF14 repeat expansion and 3 affected family members. RESULTS: The 4 
      patients had paroxysmal ataxia/dysarthria occurring between 45 and 50 years as 
      the initial manifestation of a FGF14 repeat expansion. The index case was 
      investigated in detail. We have provided a video showing one of her paroxysmal 
      episodes that could be triggered by alcohol, coffee, exertion, emotion, or 
      cigarette smoking. Brain MRI revealed mild cerebellar atrophy, and oculography 
      showed a subclinical downbeat nystagmus. Treatment with acetazolamide resulted in 
      remarkable improvement. DISCUSSION: Paroxysmal dysarthria/ataxia should prompt 
      the clinician to test for FGF14 repeat expansion/SCA27B, especially when the 
      paroxysmal attacks are associated with late-onset cerebellar ataxia and/or a 
      family history consistent with a dominant disorder.

AB  - BACKGROUND: SCA27B caused by FGF14 intronic heterozygous GAA expansions with at 
      least 250 repeats accounts for 10-60% of cases with unresolved cerebellar ataxia. 
      We aimed to assess the size and frequency of FGF14 expanded alleles in 
      individuals with cerebellar ataxia as compared with controls and to characterize 
      genetic and clinical variability. METHODS: We sized this repeat in 1876 
      individuals from France sampled for research purposes in this cross-sectional 
      study: 845 index cases with cerebellar ataxia and 324 affected relatives, 475 
      controls, as well as 119 cases with spastic paraplegia, and 113 with familial 
      essential tremor. FINDINGS: A higher frequency of expanded allele carriers in 
      index cases with ataxia was significant only above 300 GAA repeats (10.1%, 
      n = 85) compared with controls (1.1%, n = 5) (p < 0.0001) whereas GAA(250-299) 
      alleles were detected in 1.7% of both groups. Eight of 14 index cases with 
      GAA(250-299) repeats had other causal pathogenic variants (4/14) and/or 
      discordance of co-segregation (5/14), arguing against GAA causality. We compared 
      the clinical signs in 127 GAA(>/=300) carriers to cases with non-expanded GAA 
      ataxia resulting in defining a key phenotype triad: onset after 45 years, 
      downbeat nystagmus, episodic ataxic features including diplopia; and a frequent 
      absence of dysarthria. All maternally transmitted alleles above 100 GAA were 
      unstable with a median expansion of +18 repeats per generation (r(2) = 0.44; 
      p < 0.0001). In comparison, paternally transmitted alleles above 100 GAA mostly 
      decreased in size (-15 GAA (r(2) = 0.63; p < 0.0001)), resulting in the 
      transmission bias observed in SCA27B pedigrees. INTERPRETATION: SCA27B diagnosis 
      must consider both the phenotype and GAA expansion size. In carriers of 
      GAA(250-299) repeats, the absence of documented familial transmission and a 
      presentation deviating from the key SCA27B phenotype, should prompt the search 
      for an alternative cause. Affected fathers have a reduced risk of having affected 
      children, which has potential implications for genetic counseling. FUNDING: This

TI  - Copy Number Variant Analysis of Spinocerebellar Ataxia Genes in a Cohort of Dutch 
      Patients With Cerebellar Ataxia.
PG  - e200050
LID - 10.1212/NXG.0000000000200050 [doi]
LID - e200050
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a genetically 
      heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders generally caused by single 
      nucleotide variants (SNVs) or indels in coding regions or by repeat expansions in 
      coding and noncoding regions of SCA genes. Copy number variants (CNVs) have now 
      also been reported for 3 genes-ITPR1, FGF14, and SPTBN2-but not all SCA genes 
      have been screened for CNVs as the underlying cause of the disease in patients. 
      In this study, we aim to assess the prevalence of CNVs encompassing 36 known SCA 
      genes. METHODS: A cohort of patients with cerebellar ataxia who were referred to 
      the University Medical Center Groningen for SCA genetic diagnostics was selected 
      for this study. Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping was 
      performed using the Infinium Global Screening Array. Following data processing, 
      genotyping data were uploaded into NxClinical software to perform CNV analysis 
      per patient and to visualize identified CNVs in 36 genes with allocated SCA 
      symbols. The clinical relevance of detected CNVs was determined using evidence 
      from studies based on PubMed literature searches for similar CNVs and phenotypic 
      features. RESULTS: Of the 338 patients with cerebellar ataxia, we identified 
      putative clinically relevant CNV deletions in 3 patients: an identical deletion 
      encompassing ITPR1 in 2 patients, who turned out to be related, and a deletion 
      involving PPP2R2B in another patient. Although the CNV deletion in ITPR1 was 
      clearly the underlying cause of SCA15 in the 2 related patients, the clinical 
      significance of the deletion in PPP2R2B remained unknown. DISCUSSION: We showed 
      that CNVs detectable with the limited resolution of SNP array are a very rare 
      cause of SCA. Nevertheless, we suggest adding CNV analysis alongside SNV analysis 
      to SCA gene diagnostics using next-generation sequencing approaches, at least for 
      ITPR1, to improve the genetic diagnostics for patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The GAA repeat expansion within the fibroblast growth 
      factor 14 (FGF14) gene has been found to be associated with late-onset cerebellar 
      ataxia. This study aimed to investigate the genetic causes of cerebellar ataxia 
      in patients in Japan. METHODS: We collected a case series of 940 index patients 
      who presented with chronic cerebellar ataxia and remained genetically undiagnosed 
      after our preliminary genetic screening. To investigate the FGF14 repeat locus, 
      we employed an integrated diagnostic strategy that involved fluorescence amplicon 
      length analysis polymerase chain reaction (PCR), repeat-primed PCR, and long-read 
      sequencing. RESULTS: Pathogenic FGF14 GAA repeat expansions were detected in 12 
      patients from 11 unrelated families. The median size of the pathogenic GAA repeat 
      was 309 repeats (range: 270-316 repeats). In these patients, the mean age of 
      onset was 66.9 +/- 9.6 years, with episodic symptoms observed in 56% of patients 
      and parkinsonism in 30% of patients. We also detected FGF14 repeat expansions in 
      a patient with a phenotype of multiple system atrophy, including cerebellar 
      ataxia, parkinsonism, autonomic ataxia, and bilateral vocal cord paralysis. Brain 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed normal to mild cerebellar atrophy, and a 
      follow-up study conducted after a mean period of 6 years did not reveal any 
      significant progression. DISCUSSION: This study highlights the importance of 
      FGF14 GAA repeat analysis in patients with late-onset cerebellar ataxia, 
      particularly when they exhibit episodic symptoms, or their brain MRI shows no 
      apparent cerebellar atrophy. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of 
      the clinical variability of GAA-FGF14-related diseases.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Intronic FGF14 GAA repeat expansions have recently been found to be a 
      common cause of hereditary ataxia (GAA-FGF14 ataxia; SCA27B). The global 
      epidemiology and regional prevalence of this newly reported disorder remain to be 
      established. In this study, we investigated the frequency of GAA-FGF14 ataxia in 
      a large cohort of Brazilian patients with unsolved adult-onset ataxia. METHODS: 
      We recruited 93 index patients with genetically unsolved adult-onset ataxia 
      despite extensive genetic investigation and genotyped the FGF14 repeat locus. 
      Patients were recruited across 4 different regions of Brazil. RESULTS: Of the 93 
      index patients, 8 (9%) carried an FGF14 (GAA)(>/=250) expansion. The expansion was 
      also identified in 1 affected relative. Seven patients were of European descent, 
      1 was of African descent, and 1was of admixed American ancestry. One patient 
      carrying a (GAA)(376) expansion developed ataxia at age 28 years, confirming that 
      GAA-FGF14 ataxia can occur before the age of 30 years. One patient displayed 
      episodic symptoms, while none had downbeat nystagmus. Cerebellar atrophy was 
      observed on brain MRI in 7 of 8 patients (87%). DISCUSSION: Our results suggest 
      that GAA-FGF14 ataxia is a common cause of adult-onset ataxia in the Brazilian 
      population, although larger studies are needed to fully define its epidemiology.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dominantly inherited GAA repeat expansions in the 
      fibroblast growth factor 14 (FGF14) gene have recently been shown to cause 
      spinocerebellar ataxia 27B (SCA27B). We aimed to study the frequency and 
      phenotype of SCA27B in a cohort of patients with unsolved late-onset cerebellar 
      ataxia (LOCA). We also assessed the frequency of SCA27B relative to other 
      genetically defined LOCAs. METHODS: We recruited a consecutive series of 107 
      patients with LOCA, of whom 64 remained genetically undiagnosed. We screened 
      these 64 patients for the FGF14 GAA repeat expansion. We next analysed the 
      frequency of SCA27B relative to other genetically defined forms of LOCA in the 
      cohort of 107 patients. RESULTS: Eighteen of 64 patients (28%) carried an FGF14 
      (GAA)(>/=250) expansion. The median (range) age at onset was 62.5 (39-72) years. 
      The most common clinical features included gait ataxia (100%) and mild cerebellar 
      dysarthria (67%). In addition, episodic symptoms and downbeat nystagmus were 
      present in 39% (7/18) and 37% (6/16) of patients, respectively. SCA27B was the 
      most common cause of LOCA in our cohort (17%, 18/107). Among patients with 
      genetically defined LOCA, SCA27B was the main cause of pure ataxia, RFC1-related 
      disease of ataxia with neuropathy, and SPG7 of ataxia with spasticity. 
      CONCLUSION: We showed that SCA27B is the most common cause of LOCA in our cohort. 
      Our results support the use of FGF14 GAA repeat expansion screening as a 
      first-tier genetic test in patients with LOCA.

TI  - Intronic FGF14 GAA repeat expansions are a common cause of ataxia syndromes with 
      neuropathy and bilateral vestibulopathy.
PG  - 175-179

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intronic GAA repeat expansions in the fibroblast growth factor 14 
      gene (FGF14) have recently been identified as a common cause of ataxia with 
      potential phenotypic overlap with RFC1-related cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy and 
      vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). Our objective was to report on the 
      frequency of intronic FGF14 GAA repeat expansions in patients with an unexplained 
      CANVAS-like phenotype. METHODS: We recruited 45 patients negative for biallelic 
      RFC1 repeat expansions with a combination of cerebellar ataxia plus peripheral 
      neuropathy and/or bilateral vestibulopathy (BVP), and genotyped the FGF14 repeat 
      locus. Phenotypic features of GAA-FGF14-positive versus GAA-FGF14-negative 
      patients were compared. RESULTS: Frequency of FGF14 GAA repeat expansions was 38% 
      (17/45) in the entire cohort, 38% (5/13) in the subgroup with cerebellar ataxia 
      plus polyneuropathy, 43% (9/21) in the subgroup with cerebellar ataxia plus BVP 
      and 27% (3/11) in patients with all three features. BVP was observed in 75% 
      (12/16) of GAA-FGF14-positive patients. Polyneuropathy was at most mild and of 
      mixed sensorimotor type in six of eight GAA-FGF14-positive patients. Family 
      history of ataxia (59% vs 15%; p=0.007) was significantly more frequent and 
      permanent cerebellar dysarthria (12% vs 54%; p=0.009) significantly less frequent 
      in GAA-FGF14-positive than in GAA-FGF14-negative patients. Age at onset was 
      inversely correlated to the size of the repeat expansion (Pearson's r, -0.67; 
      R(2)=0.45; p=0.0031). CONCLUSIONS: GAA-FGF14-related disease is a common cause of 
      cerebellar ataxia with polyneuropathy and/or BVP, and should be included in the 
      differential diagnosis of RFC1 CANVAS and disease spectrum.

AB  - Dominantly inherited GAA repeat expansions in FGF14 are a common cause of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (GAA-FGF14 ataxia; spinocerebellar ataxia 27B). Molecular 
      confirmation of FGF14 GAA repeat expansions has thus far mostly relied on 
      long-read sequencing, a technology that is not yet widely available in clinical 
      laboratories. We developed and validated a strategy to detect FGF14 GAA repeat 
      expansions using long-range PCR, bidirectional repeat-primed PCRs, and Sanger 
      sequencing. We compared this strategy to targeted nanopore sequencing in a cohort 
      of 22 French Canadian patients and next validated it in a cohort of 53 French 
      index patients with unsolved ataxia. Method comparison showed that capillary 
      electrophoresis of long-range PCR amplification products significantly 
      underestimated expansion sizes compared to nanopore sequencing (slope, 0.87 [95% 
      CI, 0.81 to 0.93]; intercept, 14.58 [95% CI, - 2.48 to 31.12]) and gel 
      electrophoresis (slope, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.78 to 0.97]; intercept, 21.34 [95% CI, 
      - 27.66 to 40.22]). The latter techniques yielded similar size estimates. 
      Following calibration with internal controls, expansion size estimates were 
      similar between capillary electrophoresis and nanopore sequencing (slope: 0.98 
      [95% CI, 0.92 to 1.04]; intercept: 10.62 [95% CI, - 7.49 to 27.71]), and gel 
      electrophoresis (slope: 0.94 [95% CI, 0.88 to 1.09]; intercept: 18.81 [95% CI, 
      - 41.93 to 39.15]). Diagnosis was accurately confirmed for all 22 French Canadian 
      patients using this strategy. We also identified 9 French patients (9/53; 17%) 
      and 2 of their relatives who carried an FGF14 (GAA)(>/=250) expansion. This novel 
      strategy reliably detected and sized FGF14 GAA expansions, and compared favorably 
      to long-read sequencing.

TI  - GAA-FGF14 ataxia (SCA27B): phenotypic profile, natural history progression and 
      4-aminopyridine treatment response.
PG  - 4144-4157
LID - 10.1093/brain/awad157 [doi]
AB  - Ataxia due to an autosomal dominant intronic GAA repeat expansion in FGF14 
      [GAA-FGF14 ataxia, spinocerebellar ataxia 27B (SCA27B)] has recently been 
      identified as one of the most common genetic late-onset ataxias. We here aimed to 
      characterize its phenotypic profile, natural history progression, and 
      4-aminopyridine (4-AP) treatment response. We conducted a multi-modal cohort 
      study of 50 GAA-FGF14 patients, comprising in-depth phenotyping, cross-sectional 
      and longitudinal progression data (up to 7 years), MRI findings, serum 
      neurofilament light (sNfL) levels, neuropathology, and 4-AP treatment response 
      data, including a series of n-of-1 treatment studies. GAA-FGF14 ataxia 
      consistently presented as late-onset [60.0 years (53.5-68.5), median 
      (interquartile range)] pancerebellar syndrome, partly combined with afferent 
      sensory deficits (55%) and dysautonomia (28%). Dysautonomia increased with 
      duration while cognitive impairment remained infrequent, even in advanced stages. 
      Cross-sectional and longitudinal assessments consistently indicated mild 
      progression of ataxia [0.29 Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) 
      points/year], not exceeding a moderate disease severity even in advanced stages 
      (maximum SARA score: 18 points). Functional impairment increased relatively 
      slowly (unilateral mobility aids after 8 years in 50% of patients). Corresponding 
      to slow progression and low extra-cerebellar involvement, sNfL was not increased 
      relative to controls. Concurrent second diseases (including progressive 
      supranuclear palsy neuropathology) represented major individual aggravators of 
      disease severity, constituting important caveats for planning future GAA-FGF14 
      trials. A treatment response to 4-AP with relevance for everyday living was 
      reported by 86% of treated patients. A series of three prospective n-of-1 
      treatment experiences with on/off design showed marked reduction in daily 
      symptomatic time and symptom severity on 4-AP. Our study characterizes the 
      phenotypic profile, natural history progression, and 4-AP treatment response of 
      GAA-FGF14 ataxia. It paves the way towards large-scale natural history studies 
      and 4-AP treatment trials in this newly discovered, possibly most frequent, and 
      treatable late-onset ataxia.

PG  - 128-141
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa2207406 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The late-onset cerebellar ataxias (LOCAs) have largely resisted 
      molecular diagnosis. METHODS: We sequenced the genomes of six persons with 
      autosomal dominant LOCA who were members of three French Canadian families and 
      identified a candidate pathogenic repeat expansion. We then tested for 
      association between the repeat expansion and disease in two independent 
      case-control series - one French Canadian (66 patients and 209 controls) and the 
      other German (228 patients and 199 controls). We also genotyped the repeat in 20 
      Australian and 31 Indian index patients. We assayed gene and protein expression 
      in two postmortem cerebellum specimens and two induced pluripotent stem-cell 
      (iPSC)-derived motor-neuron cell lines. RESULTS: In the six French Canadian 
      patients, we identified a GAA repeat expansion deep in the first intron of FGF14, 
      which encodes fibroblast growth factor 14. Cosegregation of the repeat expansion 
      with disease in the families supported a pathogenic threshold of at least 250 GAA 
      repeats ([GAA](>/=250)). There was significant association between FGF14 
      (GAA)(>/=250) expansions and LOCA in the French Canadian series (odds ratio, 
      105.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 31.09 to 334.20; P<0.001) and in the German 
      series (odds ratio, 8.76; 95% CI, 3.45 to 20.84; P<0.001). The repeat expansion 
      was present in 61%, 18%, 15%, and 10% of French Canadian, German, Australian, and 
      Indian index patients, respectively. In total, we identified 128 patients with 
      LOCA who carried an FGF14 (GAA)(>/=250) expansion. Postmortem cerebellum specimens 
      and iPSC-derived motor neurons from patients showed reduced expression of FGF14 
      RNA and protein. CONCLUSIONS: A dominantly inherited deep intronic GAA repeat 
      expansion in FGF14 was found to be associated with LOCA. (Funded by Fondation 
      Groupe Monaco and others.).

AB  - Adult-onset cerebellar ataxias are a group of neurodegenerative conditions that 
      challenge both genetic discovery and molecular diagnosis. In this study, we 
      identified an intronic (GAA) repeat expansion in fibroblast growth factor 14 
      (FGF14). Genetic analysis of 95 Australian individuals with adult-onset ataxia 
      identified four (4.2%) with (GAA)(>300) and a further nine individuals with 
      (GAA)(>250). PCR and long-read sequence analysis revealed these were pure (GAA) 
      repeats. In comparison, no control subjects had (GAA)(>300) and only 2/311 
      control individuals (0.6%) had a pure (GAA)(>250). In a German validation cohort, 
      9/104 (8.7%) of affected individuals had (GAA)(>335) and a further six had 
      (GAA)(>250), whereas 10/190 (5.3%) control subjects had (GAA)(>250) but none were 
      (GAA)(>335). The combined data suggest (GAA)(>335) are disease causing and fully 
      penetrant (p = 6.0 x 10(-8), OR = 72 [95% CI = 4.3-1,227]), while (GAA)(>250) is 
      likely pathogenic with reduced penetrance. Affected individuals had an 
      adult-onset, slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia with variable features 
      including vestibular impairment, hyper-reflexia, and autonomic dysfunction. A 
      negative correlation between age at onset and repeat length was observed (R(2) = 
      0.44, p = 0.00045, slope = -0.12) and identification of a shared haplotype in a 
      minority of individuals suggests that the expansion can be inherited or generated 
      de novo during meiotic division. This study demonstrates the power of genome 
      sequencing and advanced bioinformatic tools to identify novel repeat expansions 
      via model-free, genome-wide analysis and identifies SCA50/ATX-FGF14 as a frequent 
      cause of adult-onset ataxia.

TI  - Genome-wide detection of tandem DNA repeats that are expanded in autism.
PG  - 80-86
LID - 10.1038/s41586-020-2579-z [doi]
AB  - Tandem DNA repeats vary in the size and sequence of each unit (motif). When 
      expanded, these tandem DNA repeats have been associated with more than 40 
      monogenic disorders(1). Their involvement in disorders with complex genetics is 
      largely unknown, as is the extent of their heterogeneity. Here we investigated 
      the genome-wide characteristics of tandem repeats that had motifs with a length 
      of 2-20 base pairs in 17,231 genomes of families containing individuals with 
      autism spectrum disorder (ASD)(2,3) and population control individuals(4). We 
      found extensive polymorphism in the size and sequence of motifs. Many of the 
      tandem repeat loci that we detected correlated with cytogenetic fragile sites. At 
      2,588 loci, gene-associated expansions of tandem repeats that were rare among 
      population control individuals were significantly more prevalent among 
      individuals with ASD than their siblings without ASD, particularly in exons and 
      near splice junctions, and in genes related to the development of the nervous 
      system and cardiovascular system or muscle. Rare tandem repeat expansions had a 
      prevalence of 23.3% in children with ASD compared with 20.7% in children without 
      ASD, which suggests that tandem repeat expansions make a collective contribution 
      to the risk of ASD of 2.6%. These rare tandem repeat expansions included 
      previously undescribed ASD-linked expansions in DMPK and FXN, which are 
      associated with neuromuscular conditions, and in previously unknown loci such as 
      FGF14 and CACNB1. Rare tandem repeat expansions were associated with lower IQ and 
      adaptive ability. Our results show that tandem DNA repeat expansions contribute 
      strongly to the genetic aetiology and phenotypic complexity of ASD.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 27 (SCA27) is an autosomal dominant SCA caused by variants 
      in the fibroblast growth factor 14 (FGF14) gene. We examined a Japanese SCA 
      patient whose deceased father also suffered from SCA. The patient was a 
      63-year-old male. He graduated from junior high school but received no further 
      education. The predominant complaint was slowly progressive dysarthria and gait 
      disturbance, which appeared at age 47. He showed pathological saccadic dysmetria, 
      saccadic intrusions into smooth pursuit eye movements, dysarthria, and limb and 
      truncal ataxia. His gait was wide-based but he did not require a walking stick. 
      Limb muscle strength was intact. Deep tendon reflexes were normal or slightly 
      reduced. Pathological reflexes were absent. He demonstrated mildly impaired 
      vibration sense in the lower limbs. There was no urinary dysfunction. Brain MRI 
      showed cerebellar atrophy without brainstem involvement. We first confirmed the 
      absence of repeat expansion in genes known to be responsible for SCAs 1-3, 6-8, 
      10, 12, 17, 36 and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy. By exome analysis, we 
      identified a novel heterozygous variant (NM_004115, c.529A>T; Lys177X) in exon 4 
      of the FGF14 gene. This variant is expected to generate a truncated FGF14 protein 
      lacking the heparin binding sites, those are likely to modify the activity of 
      FGF14. We confirmed the absence of the variant in 502 healthy Japanese 
      individuals by Sanger sequencing. There is no record of the variant in public 
      databases. We conclude that the novel variation in FGF14 is causative for SCA27 
      in this patient.

TI  - A panel study on patients with dominant cerebellar ataxia highlights the 
      frequency of channelopathies.
PG  - 1579-1594
LID - 10.1093/brain/awx081 [doi]
AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias have a marked heterogeneous genetic 
      background, with mutations in 34 genes identified so far. This large amount of 
      implicated genes accounts for heterogeneous clinical presentations, making 
      genotype-phenotype correlations a major challenge in the field. While 
      polyglutamine ataxias, linked to CAG repeat expansions in genes such as ATXN1, 
      ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, CACNA1A and TBP, have been extensively characterized in 
      large cohorts, there is a need for comprehensive assessment of frequency and 
      phenotype of more 'conventional' ataxias. After exclusion of CAG/polyglutamine 
      expansions in spinocerebellar ataxia genes in 412 index cases with dominantly 
      inherited cerebellar ataxias, we aimed to establish the relative frequencies of 
      mutations in other genes, with an approach combining panel sequencing and TaqMan(R) 
      polymerase chain reaction assay. We found relevant genetic variants in 59 
      patients (14.3%). The most frequently mutated were channel genes [CACNA1A (n = 
      16), KCND3 (n = 4), KCNC3 (n = 2) and KCNA1 (n = 2)]. Deletions in ITPR1 (n = 11) 
      were followed by biallelic variants in SPG7 (n = 9). Variants in AFG3L2 (n = 7) 
      came next in frequency, and variants were rarely found in STBN2 (n = 2), ELOVL5, 
      FGF14, STUB1 and TTBK2 (n = 1 each). Interestingly, possible risk factor variants 
      were detected in SPG7 and POLG. Clinical comparisons showed that ataxias due to 
      channelopathies had a significantly earlier age at onset with an average of 24.6 
      years, versus 40.9 years for polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias and 
      37.8 years for SPG7-related forms (P = 0.001). In contrast, disease duration was 
      significantly longer in the former (20.5 years versus 9.3 and 13.7, P=0.001), 
      though for similar functional stages, indicating slower progression of the 
      disease. Of interest, intellectual deficiency was more frequent in channel 
      spinocerebellar ataxias, while cognitive impairment in adulthood was similar 
      among the three groups. Similar differences were found among a single gene group, 
      comparing 23 patients with CACNA1A expansions (spinocerebellar ataxia 6) to 22 
      patients with CACNA1A point mutations, which had lower average age at onset (25.2 
      versus 47.3 years) with longer disease duration (18.7 versus 10.9), but lower 
      severity indexes (0.39 versus 0.44), indicating slower progression of the 
      disease. In conclusion, we identified relevant genetic variations in up to 15% of 
      cases after exclusion of polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias, and 
      confirmed CACNA1A and SPG7 as major ataxia genes. We could delineate firm 
      genotype-phenotype correlations that are important for genetic counselling and of 
      possible prognostic value.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 28: a novel AFG3L2 mutation in a German family with young 
      onset, slow progression and saccadic slowing.
PG  - 19

LID - 19
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 28 (SCA28) is related to mutations of the 
      ATPase family gene 3-like 2 gene (AFG3L2). To date, 13 private missense mutations 
      have been identified in families of French, Italian, and German ancestry, but 
      overall, the disorder seems to be rare in Europe. Here, we report a kindred of 
      German ancestry with four affected family members presenting with slowly 
      progressive ataxia, mild pyramidal tract signs and slow saccades. METHODS: After 
      excluding repeat expansions in the genes for SCA1-3, 6-8, 10, 12, and 17, Sanger 
      sequencing of the coding regions of TTBK2 (SCA11), KCNC3 (SCA13), PRKCG (SCA14), 
      FGF14 (SCA27) and AFG3L2 (SCA28) was performed. The 17 coding exons of AFG3L2 
      with flanking intronic sequences were amplified by PCR and sequenced on both 
      strands. RESULTS: Sequencing detected a novel potential missense mutation 
      (p.Y689N) in the C-terminal proteolytic domain, the mutational hotspot of AFG3L2. 
      The online programme "PolyPhen-2" classifies this amino acid exchange as probably 
      damaging (score 0.990). Similarly to most of the published SCA28 mutations, the 
      novel mutation is located within exon 16. Mutations in exon 16 alter the 
      proteolytic activity of the protease AFG3L2 that is highly expressed in Purkinje 
      cells. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic testing should be considered in dominant ataxia with 
      pyramidal tract signs and saccadic slowing.

AB  - Purine repeat sequences present in the human genome are known to act as hotspots 
      for mutations leading to chromosomal imbalances. It is established that large 
      purine repeats (PRs) form stable DNA triplex structure which can inhibit gene 
      expression. Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), the autosomal neurodegenerative disorder 
      is the only human disease known so far, where a large purine (GAA) repeat in the 
      FXN gene is known to inhibit the expression of frataxin protein. We explored the 
      hidden purine repeats (PRn with n >/= 200) if any, in the human genome to find out 
      how they are associated with neurological disorders. The results showed 28 PRs, 
      which are mostly restricted to the intronic regions. Interestingly, the 
      transcriptome expression analysis of PR-carrying genes (PR-genes) revealed that 
      most of them are down-regulated in neurological disorders (autism, Alzheimer's 
      disease, schizophrenia, epilepsy, mental retardation, Parkinson's disease, brain 
      tumor) as compared to that in healthy controls. The altered gene expression in 
      brain disorders can be interpreted in terms of a possible expansion of purine 
      repeats leading to formation of very stable DNA-triplex and/or alleviation of the 
      repair enzymes and/or other unknown cellular factors. Interactome analysis 
      identified four PR-genes in signaling pathways whose dysregulation is correlated 
      directly with pathogenesis: GRK5 and KLK6 in Alzheimer's disease; FGF14 in 
      craniosynostosis, mental retardation and FLT1 in neuroferritinopathy. By virtue 
      of being mutational hotspots and their ability to form DNA-triplex, purine 
      repeats in genome disturb the genome integrity and interfere with the 
      transcriptional regulation. However, validation of the disease linkage of 
      PR-genes can be validated using knock-out techniques.

TI  - Mutation analysis in the fibroblast growth factor 14 gene: frameshift mutation 
      and polymorphisms in patients with inherited ataxias.
PG  - 118-20
AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) with autosomal dominant inheritance are a 
      group of neurodegenerative disorders with overlapping as well as highly variable 
      phenotypes. Genetically, at least 25 different loci have been identified. Seven 
      SCAs are caused by CAG trinucleotide repeat expansions, for 13 the chromosomal 
      localization is known solely. Recently, a missense mutation in the fibroblast 
      growth factor 14 gene (FGF14) has been reported in a Dutch family with a new 
      dominantly inherited form of SCA. To evaluate the frequency of mutations in the 
      FGF14 gene, we performed molecular genetic analyses for the five exons in 208 
      nonrelated familial ataxia cases and 208 control samples. In one patient, we 
      detected a novel single base pair deletion in exon 4 (c.487delA) creating a 
      frameshift mutation. In addition, we found DNA polymorphisms in exon 1a, 4, and 
      5, an amino-acid exchange at position 124, as well as a single-nucleotide 
      polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated region of exon 5.

TI  - Molecular genetics of hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia: mutation analysis of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia genes and CAG/CTG repeat expansion detection in 225 
      Italian families.
PG  - 727-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias are a clinical and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of progressive neurodegenerative diseases, at present 
      associated with 22 loci (spinocerebellar ataxia [SCA] 1-SCA8, SCA10-SCA19, SCA21, 
      SCA22, fibroblast growth factor 14 [FGF14]-SCA, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy [DRPLA]). The relevant gene has been identified in 12 cases (SCA1-3, 
      SCA6-8, SCA10, SCA12, FGF14, and DRPLA), and in all but the recently identified 
      SCA14, SCA17, PRKCG and FGF14 genes, the defect consists of the expansion of a 
      short nucleotide repeat. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relative prevalence of 
      SCA1-3, SCA6-8, SCA10, SCA12, and SCA17 gene expansions in Italian families with 
      hereditary ataxia, specifically to verify the occurrence of SCA10, SCA12, and 
      SCA17 in Italy; and to analyze samples from probands with negative test results 
      at the initial screening by means of the repeat expansion detection technique to 
      identify CAG/CTG expansions in novel loci.Patients Two hundred twenty-five 
      unrelated Italian index cases with hereditary ataxia, most (n = 183) of whom 
      presented with a clear dominantly transmitted trait. RESULTS: We found that SCA1 
      and SCA2 gene mutations accounted for most cases (21% and 24%, respectively). We 
      found SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, and SCA17 to be very rare (approximately 1% each), 
      and no case of SCA10 or SCA12 was identified. Half of the index cases (113/225) 
      were negative for expansions in the known SCA genes. Repeat expansion detection 
      analysis performed on 111 of these cases showed a CAG/CTG repeat expansion of at 
      least 50 triplets in 22 (20%). Twenty-one of 22 expansions could be attributed to 
      length variation at 2 polymorphic loci (expanded repeat domain CAG/CTG 1 [ERDA1] 
      or CTG repeat on chromosome 18q21.1 [CTG18.1]). In 1 patient, the expansion was 
      assigned to the DRPLA gene. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of SCA1-3 and SCA6-7 
      gene mutations is peculiar in Italy. We found a relatively high frequency of SCA1 
      and SCA2 gene expansions; SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7 mutations were rare, compared with 
      other European countries. No SCA10 or SCA12 and only a few SCA8 (2/225) and SCA17 
      (2/225) families were detected. In patients negative for defects in known SCA 
      genes, repeat expansion detection data strongly suggest that, at least in our 
      population, CAG/CTG expansions in novel genes should be considered an unlikely 
      cause of the SCA phenotype.
