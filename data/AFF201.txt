AB  - OBJECTIVE: AFF2 mutations were associated with X-linked intellectual 
      developmental disorder-109 and in males with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The 
      relationship between AFF2 and epilepsy has not been defined. METHOD: Trios-based 
      whole-exome sequencing was performed in a cohort of 372 unrelated cases 
      (families) with partial (focal) epilepsy without acquired causes. RESULTS: Five 
      hemizygous missense AFF2 mutations were identified in five males with partial 
      epilepsy and antecedent febrile seizures without intellectual disability or other 
      developmental abnormalities. The mutations did not present in the controls of 
      general populations with an aggregate frequency significantly higher than that in 
      the control populations. Previously, intellectual disability-associated AFF2 
      mutations were genomic rearrangements and CCG repeat expansion mutations mostly, 
      whereas the mutations associated with partial epilepsy were all missense. 
      Missense AFF2 mutations associated with epilepsy fell into the regions from 
      N-terminal to the nuclear localization signal 1 (NLS1), while ASD-associated 
      missense mutations fell in the regions from NLS1 to C-terminal. CONCLUSION: AFF2 
      is potentially a candidate causative gene of X-link partial epilepsy with 
      antecedent febrile seizures. The genotype-phenotype correlation and molecular 
      sub-regional effect of AFF2 help in explaining the mechanisms underlying 
      phenotypic variations.

TI  - Simultaneous Screening of the FRAXA and FRAXE Loci for Rapid Detection of FMR1 
      CGG and/or AFF2 CCG Repeat Expansions by Triplet-Primed PCR.

AB  - Moderate to hyper-expansion of trinucleotide repeats at the FRAXA and FRAXE 
      fragile sites, with or without concurrent hypermethylation, has been associated 
      with intellectual disability and other conditions. Unlike molecular diagnosis of 
      FMR1 CGG repeat expansions in FRAXA, current detection of AFF2 CCG repeat 
      expansions in FRAXE relies on low-throughput and otherwise inefficient techniques 
      combining Southern blot analysis and PCR. A novel triplet-primed PCR assay was 
      developed for simultaneous screening for trinucleotide repeat expansions at the 
      FRAXA and FRAXE fragile sites, and was validated using archived clinical samples 
      of known FMR1 and AFF2 genotypes. Population samples and FRAXE-affected samples 
      were sequenced for the evaluation of variations in the AFF2 CCG repeat structure. 
      The duplex assay accurately identified expansions at the FMR1 and AFF2 
      trinucleotide repeat loci. On Sanger sequencing of the AFF2 CCG repeat, the 
      single-nucleotide polymorphism variant rs868914124(C) that effectively adds two 
      CCG repeats at the 5'-end, was enriched in the Malay population and with short 
      repeats (<11 CCGs), and was present in all six expanded AFF2 alleles of this 
      study. All expanded AFF2 alleles contained multiple non-CCG interruptions toward 
      the 5'-end of the repeat. A sensitive, robust, and rapid assay has been developed 
      for the simultaneous detection of expansion mutations at the FMR1 and AFF2 
      trinucleotide repeat loci, simplifying screening for FRAXA- and FRAXE-associated 
      disorders.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common cause of intellectual disability, 
      developmental delay and autism spectrum disorders. This syndrome is due to a 
      functional loss of the FMR1 gene product FMRP, and, in most cases, it is caused 
      by CGG repeat expansion in the FMR1 promoter. Yet, also other FMR1 mutations may 
      cause a FXS-like phenotype. Since standard molecular testing does not include the 
      analysis of the FMR1 coding region, the prevalence of point mutations causing FXS 
      is not well known. Here, high resolution melting (HRM) was used to screen for 
      FMR1 gene mutations in 508 males with clinical signs of mental retardation and 
      developmental delay, but without CGG and GCC repeat expansions in the FMR1 gene 
      and AFF2 genes, respectively. Sequence variations were identified by HRM analysis 
      and verified by direct DNA sequencing. Two novel missense mutations (p.Gly482Ser 
      in one patient and p.Arg534His in two unrelated patients), one intronic and two 
      3'-untranslated region (UTR) variations were identified in the FMR1 gene. 
      Missense mutations in the FMR1 gene might account for a considerable proportion 
      of cases in male patients with FXS-related symptoms, such as those linked to 
      mental retardation and developmental delay.

AB  - Folate-sensitive fragile sites (FSFS) are a rare cytogenetically visible subset 
      of dynamic mutations. Of the eight molecularly characterized FSFS, four are 
      associated with intellectual disability (ID). Cytogenetic expression results from 
      CGG tri-nucleotide-repeat expansion mutation associated with local CpG 
      hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing. The best studied is the FRAXA 
      site in the FMR1 gene, where large expansions cause fragile X syndrome, the most 
      common inherited ID syndrome. Here we studied three families with FRA2A 
      expression at 2q11 associated with a wide spectrum of neurodevelopmental 
      phenotypes. We identified a polymorphic CGG repeat in a conserved, brain-active 
      alternative promoter of the AFF3 gene, an autosomal homolog of the X-linked 
      AFF2/FMR2 gene: Expansion of the AFF2 CGG repeat causes FRAXE ID. We found that 
      FRA2A-expressing individuals have mosaic expansions of the AFF3 CGG repeat in the 
      range of several hundred repeat units. Moreover, bisulfite sequencing and 
      pyrosequencing both suggest AFF3 promoter hypermethylation. cSNP-analysis 
      demonstrates monoallelic expression of the AFF3 gene in FRA2A carriers thus 
      predicting that FRA2A expression results in functional haploinsufficiency for 
      AFF3 at least in a subset of tissues. By whole-mount in situ hybridization the 
      mouse AFF3 ortholog shows strong regional expression in the developing brain, 
      somites and limb buds in 9.5-12.5dpc mouse embryos. Our data suggest that there 
      may be an association between FRA2A and a delay in the acquisition of motor and 
      language skills in the families studied here. However, additional cases are 
      required to firmly establish a causal relationship.

LID - 10.1126/science.1245831 [doi]
AB  - Epigenetic gene silencing is seen in several repeat-expansion diseases. In 
      fragile X syndrome, the most common genetic form of mental retardation, a CGG 
      trinucleotide-repeat expansion adjacent to the fragile X mental retardation 1 
      (FMR1) gene promoter results in its epigenetic silencing. Here, we show that FMR1 
      silencing is mediated by the FMR1 mRNA. The FMR1 mRNA contains the transcribed 
      CGG-repeat tract as part of the 5' untranslated region, which hybridizes to the 
      complementary CGG-repeat portion of the FMR1 gene to form an RNA.DNA duplex. 
      Disrupting the interaction of the mRNA with the CGG-repeat portion of the FMR1 
      gene prevents promoter silencing. Thus, our data link trinucleotide-repeat 
      expansion to a form of RNA-directed gene silencing mediated by direct 
      interactions of the trinucleotide-repeat RNA and DNA.

AB  - Alterations of the Fragile Mental Retardation 2 gene (FMR2, synonym AFF2) can 
      result in non-specific, mild to borderline X-linked intellectual disability 
      (XLID), and behavioral problems. The well-known molecular pathomechanism of this 
      condition, also referred to as FRAXE, is a (CCG)(n) trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion which leads to silencing of the FMR2 gene. However, deletions within 
      the FMR2 gene may also be causative of the disorder. Here, we report on two 
      brothers diagnosed with FRAXE in whom a small deletion in the FMR2 gene was 
      detected by whole genome array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). The 
      deletion was also present in their clinically healthy mother and maternal uncle 
      who was similarly affected, but not in a healthy older brother of the two 
      patients. Our observation demonstrates that FMR2 gene deletions may contribute to 
      the FRAXE phenotype. Therefore, we suggest that screening for FMR2 gene deletions 
      using array CGH should be considered in patients with non-specific XLID and 
      absent trinucleotide expansion.

TI  - Distribution of CGG/GCC repeats at the FMR1 and FMR2 genes in an Indian 
      population with mental retardation of unknown etiology.
PG  - 281-4
LID - 10.1089/gtmb.2010.0167 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Fragile X syndrome is one of the X-linked disorders associated with 
      moderate to severe mental retardation. Fragile X A syndrome (FRAXA) and fragile X 
      E syndrome (FRAXE) are caused by trinucleotide repeat expansion of CGG and GCC 
      repeats at the 5' untranslated region of the FMR1 and FMR2 genes, respectively. 
      The present study was undertaken to identify the repeat polymorphism and to 
      estimate the risk of transmission in Andhra Pradesh and surrounding states of 
      South India. RESULTS: The FRAXA and FRAXE allelic polymorphisms were studied by 
      radioactive polymerase chain reaction that revealed 25 FRAXA among 344 
      X-chromosomes and 20 FRAXE allelic variants among 212 X-chromosomes in our 
      population. The most frequent FRAXA allele size was of 29 CGG repeats (27.5%) 
      followed by allele sizes of 28 (20.8%) and 31 (7.2%), and that of FRAXE was 15 
      GCC repeats (24.0%) followed by allele containing 18 repeats (18.4%) and 16 
      repeats (11.3%). CONCLUSIONS: CGG/GCC repeat polymorphism at the FMR1 and FMR2 
      loci observed in this study demonstrated a racial and ethnic variation among the 
      populations.

TI  - Determinants of R-loop formation at convergent bidirectionally transcribed 
      trinucleotide repeats.
PG  - 1749-62
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkq935 [doi]
AB  - R-loops have been described at immunoglobulin class switch sequences, prokaryotic 
      and mitochondrial replication origins, and disease-associated (CAG)n and (GAA)n 
      trinucleotide repeats. The determinants of trinucleotide R-loop formation are 
      unclear. Trinucleotide repeat expansions cause diseases including DM1 (CTG)n, 
      SCA1 (CAG)n, FRAXA (CGG)n, FRAXE (CCG)n and FRDA (GAA)n. Bidirectional convergent 
      transcription across these disease repeats can occur. We find R-loops formed when 
      CTG or CGG and their complementary strands CAG or CCG were transcribed; GAA 
      transcription, but not TTC, yielded R-loops. R-loop formation was sensitive to 
      DNA supercoiling, repeat length, insensitive to repeat interruptions, and formed 
      by extension of RNA:DNA hybrids in the RNA polymerase. R-loops arose by 
      transcription in one direction followed by transcription in the opposite 
      direction, and during simultaneous convergent bidirectional transcription of the 
      same repeat forming double R-loop structures. Since each transcribed disease 
      repeat formed R-loops suggests they may have biological functions.

TI  - Argonaute-2-dependent rescue of a Drosophila model of FXTAS by FRAXE premutation 
      repeat.
PG  - 2326-32
AB  - Fragile X Syndrome is the most common form of hereditary mental retardation. It 
      is caused by a large expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeat (>200 repeats) in 
      the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of the FMR1 gene that leads to silencing of its 
      transcript. Individuals with CGG repeat expansions approximately between 60 and 
      200 are referred to as premutation carriers. Fragile X-associated tremor and 
      ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), an RNA-mediated neurodegenerative disease has been 
      described in up to 50% of males carrying premutation alleles. FRAXE, the most 
      common form of non-syndromic X-linked mental retardation, is caused by expansion 
      of a CCG trinucleotide repeat (>200) in the 5'-UTR of the FMR2 gene. While the 
      FRAXE premutation length repeat is observed in the general population, there has 
      not yet been a report of a neurodegenerative phenotype associated with these 
      alleles. In this study, we show that the CCG premutation length repeat leads to 
      an RNA-mediated neurodegenerative phenotype in a Drosophila model. Furthermore, 
      we show that co-expression of both the CCG and CGG-containing RNAs suppresses 
      their independent toxicity and is dependent on the RNAi pathway. These data 
      support the concept that RNA toxicity is the mechanism of neuronal toxicity and 
      suggests potential reversal of RNA-mediated phenotypes with complementary RNA 
      molecules.

TI  - Lack of FMR3 expression in a male with non-syndromic mental retardation and a 
      microdeletion immediately distal to FRAXE CCG repeat.
PG  - 245-8
AB  - FRAXE fragile site associated mental retardation (FRAXE MR) belongs to a group of 
      non-syndromic X-linked mental retardation. Two genes, FMR2 and FMR3 (likely a 
      non-coding RNA) are transcribed from the FRAXE CpG island in the opposite 
      directions. While the contribution of the FMR2 gene to FRAXE MR has been 
      demonstrated, the role of the FMR3 gene is not known. We have screened 441 
      Brazilian mentally handicapped males for CCG repeat expansions in the FMR2 gene 
      and identified a boy with a mutation (c.-414_-357del58) immediately distal to the 
      FRAXE CCG repeat. We have established a skin fibroblast cell line from this 
      patient and tested expression of both FMR2 and FMR3 genes. Reverse transcriptase 
      PCR studies on the FMR2 and FMR3 genes showed that only the FMR3 gene 
      transcription was abolished, suggesting a possible causal relationship between 
      the lack of FMR3 expression and mental retardation in this patient. In the 
      literature, there have been few deletions described near the FRAXE CCG repeat, 
      but none was followed with expression studies. This is the first study showing 
      missing expression in the FMR3 gene with normal FMR2 transcription leading to 
      FRAXE mutation-likely phenotype. The FMR3 gene is likely a non-coding RNA gene. 
      So far all individuals with FRAXE CCG repeat expansions and cytogenetically 
      detectable FRAXE fragile site have both FMR2 and FMR3 gene expression abolished. 
      Although the function of the FMR3 gene is not known, our present study together 
      with previous studies on FRAXE MR suggest that it may play role in the processes 
      underpinning normal learning and memory.

TI  - FRAXE mutation in a mentally retarded subject and in his phenotypically normal 
      twin brother.
PG  - 157-62
AB  - The FRAXE fragile site, 600 kb distal to the more common FRAXA, has been reported 
      to be expressed in subjects with mild non-syndromal mental retardation (MR). 
      Amplification of more than 200 GCC repeats, associated with methylation of the 
      adjacent CpG island at Xq28, leads to the expression of the fragile site. In 1996 
      a large gene, FMR2, transcribed distally from the CpG island and downregulated by 
      repeat expansion and methylation, was identified. Among 232 mentally retarded 
      patients, tested FRAXA negative, we identified an Italian family segregating a 
      hypermethylated expansion at the FRAXE locus in two dizygotic twin brothers, 
      their sister and their mother. The index case was referred at 23 years of age 
      with severe MR, epilepsy, a dysmorphic face with a high arched palate, marfanoid 
      habitus and hyperreflexia of the lower limbs. His brother was referred to as 
      normal and psychometric tests confirmed he is not mentally retarded. All members 
      of the family underwent FRAXE molecular analysis, after cytogenetic expression of 
      the fraX site and negative FRAXA test. Interestingly, an expansion and a 
      hypermethylation at the FRAXE locus were found in all of them. Fibroblasts from 
      the clinically normal brother were assayed for FMR2 expression and the 
      transcription of the gene was found to be silenced. The presence of a 
      phenotypically normal male with absent FMR2 expression in fibroblasts suggests 
      that the relationship between the FRAXE mutation, FMR2 expression and MR needs to 
      be further investigated.

TI  - A survey of fragile X syndrome in a sample from Spanish Basque country.
PG  - 197-201
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited form of mental retardation. The 
      syndrome is associated with a CGG repeat expansion in the 5'UTR of the first exon 
      of the FMR1 gene. This gene maps to Xq27.3 and coincides with the cytogenetic 
      fragile site (FRAXA). The present study deals with the prevalence of fragile X 
      syndrome among individuals with mental retardation of unknown cause from 
      institutions and special schools from the Spanish Basque Country. Results of 
      cytogenetic and molecular studies, performed in a group of 134 unrelated 
      individuals (92 males and 42 females) are presented. The cytogenetic marker at 
      Xq27.3 was identified in 12 patients. Other chromosomal abnormalities were found 
      in two cases that this and previous studies confirmed as Angelman and 
      Prader-Willi syndromes. Two males, in whom the cytogenetic marker was identified, 
      were found negative for FRAXA and FRAXE expansion at the molecular level. The 
      present study shows that the frequency of the FRAXA full mutation in individuals 
      of Spanish non-Basque origin is in the range of other Spanish populations. In the 
      sample of Spanish Basque origin we have not found cytogenetic FRAXA site 
      expression, and the CGG repeat size of FMR1 gene is in the normal range. The 
      significance of these results are discussed.

TI  - Fragile X syndrome with FMR1 and FMR2 deletion.
PG  - 565-6
AB  - We report a 13 year old boy with fragile X syndrome resulting from a de novo 
      deletion of the FMR1 and FMR2 genes extending from (and including) DXS7536 
      proximally to FMR2 distally. The patient has severe developmental delay, 
      epilepsy, and behavioural difficulties, including autistic features. He has 
      epicanthic folds, in addition to facial features typical of fragile X syndrome, 
      and marked joint hypermobility. We compare our patient to the three other cases 
      reported in which both FMR1 and FMR2 are deleted. This case has the smallest 
      deletion reported to date. All four patients have epilepsy and a more severe 
      degree of mental retardation than is usual in fragile X syndrome resulting from 
      FMR1 triplet repeat expansion. Three of the patients have joint laxity and two 
      have epicanthic folds. We suggest that these features, in particular severe 
      developmental delay and epilepsy, may form part of the characteristic phenotype 
      resulting from deletion of both FMR1 and FMR2 genes. The diagnosis in this case 
      was delayed because routine cytogenetics showed no abnormality and standard 
      molecular tests for FMR1 triplet repeat expansion (PCR and Southern blotting) 
      failed. Further DNA studies should be undertaken to investigate for a deletion 
      where clinical suspicion of fragile X syndrome is strong and routine laboratory 
      tests fail.

TI  - DNA diagnosis of FRAXA and FRAXE in Chinese children with neurodevelopmental 
      disorders and fragile X syndrome.
PG  - 179-83
AB  - Fragile X (FraX) syndrome is the most common cause of inherited mental 
      retardation. To see whether FRAXA or FRAXE can account for the etiology of some 
      unexplained neurodevelopmental disorders in children, we screened for 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion in a consecutive cohort of 73 Chinese children and 
      their mothers seen in 1995 (group 1) referred for developmental assessment due to 
      developmental delay, language delay, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, 
      autistic spectrum disorder, mental retardation and/or learning disability. We 
      also screened DNA samples of all five previously diagnosed 
      cytogenetically-positive FraX boys, their mothers and sisters (group 2). A 
      control group of unrelated teenagers and adults were recruited from the community 
      (group 3). In group 1, 3 families (2 mothers and a mother and her son) were found 
      to carry a small premutation allele at FRAXA (premutation frequency = 2%, 3/153 
      independent X chromosomes), but none had any expansion at FRAXE. In group 2, all 
      5 FraX boys had full mutation at FRAXA and normal repeat length at FRAXE. In 
      group 3, 1 male has a premutation allele out of 18 males and 59 females tested 
      (premutation frequency of control = 0.7%, 1 out of 136 X chromosomes). For FRAXE 
      screening in group 3, 2 females were carriers (1.5%, 2 out of 136 X chromosomes). 
      Thus, FRAXA and FRAXE cannot account for the etiology of neurodevelopmental 
      disorders in our cohort of Chinese children, and the prevalence of FRAXE mutation 
      in normal Chinese population appears to be higher than reported in the 
      Caucasians.

TI  - Instability of the FMR2 trinucleotide repeat region associated with expanded FMR1 
      alleles.
PG  - 447-55
AB  - The fragile sites FRAXA and FRAXE, located approximately 600 kb apart on Xq27.3 
      and Xq28, respectively, are due to a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion. Although 
      the expansion mechanism for these and other trinucleotide repeat disorders 
      remains unknown, the similarities between the FRAXA and FRAXE regions suggest a 
      possible association between the 2 sites. DNA from 953 individuals was analyzed 
      to determine the distribution of FRAXE repeat sizes in this population and to 
      ascertain potential association between FRAXA and FRAXE repeat sizes. Thirty-four 
      FMR2 alleles ranging from 3-42 repeats were identified. No FRAXE expansions were 
      found in this population, supporting previous findings that FRAXE expansions are 
      rare. However, in the fragile X syndrome affected group, a FMR2 delection, 2 
      cases of FRAXE repeat instability and a FRAXE mosaic male were identified. Also, 
      a previously identified, rare FMR2 polymorphism was observed. Statistical 
      analysis showed no correlation between normal FRAXA and FRAXE repeat sizes 
      studied, although there was a significant size difference in larger FMR2 alleles 
      that segregated with expanded FMR1 alleles. These findings support the idea of an 
      association between repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene and instability or 
      deletions in the FMR2 gene.

TI  - Screening for FMR1 and FMR2 mutations in 222 individuals from Spanish special 
      schools: identification of a case of FRAXE-associated mental retardation.
PG  - 503-7
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited form of familial mental 
      retardation. It results from a (CGG)n trinucleotide expansion in the FMR1 gene 
      leading to the typical Martin-Bell phenotype. Clinical features vary depending on 
      age and sex. Expansion of a (CCG)n repeat in the FMR2 gene corresponds to the 
      FRAXE fragile site which lies distal to FRAXA and is also associated with mental 
      retardation, but it is less frequent and lacks a consistent phenotype. Analysis 
      of repeat expansions in these two genes allows the molecular diagnosis of these 
      different entities. We report here the screening of the FRAXA and FRAXE mutations 
      in 222 unrelated mentally retarded individuals attending Spanish special schools. 
      PCR and/or Southern blotting methods were used. We detected full mutations in the 
      FMR1 gene in 11 boys (4.9%) and 1 boy (0.5%) with a CCG repeat expansion in the 
      FMR2 gene. The latter shows mild mental retardation with psychotic behaviour and 
      no remarkable physical traits. Molecular studies revealed a mosaicism for 
      methylation in the FMR2 gene. This case supports the observation that expansions 
      greater than 100 repeats can be partially methylated and cause the phenotype.

TI  - Large domains of apparent delayed replication timing associated with triplet 
      repeat expansion at FRAXA and FRAXE.
PG  - 407-16
AB  - Trinucleotide repeat expansions have been implicated in the causation of a number 
      of neurodegenerative disorders. In the case of fragile X syndrome, full expansion 
      of the FMR1 repeat element (CGG)n has also been correlated with replication 
      timing delay of the locus and proximal flanking sequences in male lymphoblasts. 
      To define more extensively this altered region of DNA replication, as well as to 
      extend these studies to female cells containing premutant and mutant alleles, 
      study of the replication timing properties of a >2-Mb zone in the FRAXA region 
      (Xq27.3-q28) was undertaken by using a FISH technique. In this assay, relative 
      times of replication of specific loci are inferred from the ratios of singlet and 
      doublet hybridization signals in interphase nuclei. In all individuals with a 
      full expansion of the trinucleotide repeat, a large (1-1.2-Mb) region of delayed 
      timing was observed; the apparent timing of the earlier-replicating allele in 
      female cells in this region was intermediate between normal and affected alleles 
      in males, which is in accordance with expectations of a mixed population of cells 
      resulting from random X inactivation. In addition, expansion of the nearby FRAXE 
      locus also was found to correlate with replication timing delay, although the 
      extent of the altered region was somewhat less. Trinucleotide repeat expansion 
      thus may be acting in the Xq27.3-q28 region to alter long-range chromatin 
      structure that could influence transcription of gene sequences within the 
      affected domain.

PG  - 109-13
AB  - Five folate-sensitive fragile sites have been identified at the molecular level 
      to date. Each is characterized by an expanded and methylated trinucleotide repeat 
      CGG (CCG). Of the three X chromosome sites, FRAXA, FRAXE and FRAXF, the former 
      two are associated with mental retardation in their expanded forms. FRAXA 
      expansion results in fragile X syndrome due to down regulation of expression of 
      the FMR1 gene, which carries the hypermutable CGG repeat in the 5' untranslated 
      portion of its first exon. Mild mental retardation without consistent physical 
      findings has been found associated with expanded CCG repeats at FRAXE. We have 
      identified a large gene (FMR2) transcribed distally from the CpG island at FRAXE, 
      and down-regulated by repeat expansion and methylation. The gene is novel, 
      expressed in adult brain and placenta, and shows similarity with another human 
      protein, MLLT2, expressed from a gene at chromosome 4q21 involved in 
      translocations found in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) cells. Identification 
      of this gene will facilitate further studies to determine the role of its product 
      in FRAXE associated mental deficiency.

TI  - The cloning of FRAXF: trinucleotide repeat expansion and methylation at a third 
      fragile site in distal Xqter.
PG  - 2115-21
AB  - Three fragile sites, FRAXA, FRAXE and FRAXF lie in the Xq27-28 region of the 
      human X chromosome. The expression of FRAXA is associated with the fragile X 
      syndrome, the most prevalent form of inherited mental retardation whilst the 
      expression of FRAXE is associated with a rarer and comparatively milder form of 
      mental handicap. Both the FRAXA and FRAXE sites have been cloned and the fragile 
      site expression found to be due to the expansion of analogous CGG/GCC 
      trinucleotide repeat arrays. We describe here the cloning of the third fragile 
      site, FRAXF, and demonstrate that it involves the expansion of a (GCCGTC)n(GCC)n 
      compound array. PCR analyses across the repeat of normal individuals show that 
      the number of triplets in the array ranges from 12-26 and the most common allele 
      consists of 14 triplet units. Sequencing analyses show that 95% of normal 
      individuals have three copies of the GCCGTC motif and in these individuals, the 
      size variation observed by PCR is due to copy number alterations in the GCC 
      array. In a cytogenetically positive male with developmental delay, the array is 
      expanded by > 900 triplets and the adjacent CpG-rich region is methylated. The 
      array is also expanded in cytogenetically positive carrier females from the 
      family originally used to define the FRAXF site. We conclude that the expanded 
      array corresponds to the FRAXF fragile site.

TI  - Triplet repeat expansion at the FRAXE locus and X-linked mild mental handicap.
PG  - 81-6
AB  - We have recently shown that the expression of the FRAXE fragile site in Xq28 is 
      associated with the expansion of a GCC trinucleotide repeat. In the families 
      studied, FRAXE expression is also associated with mild mental handicap. Here we 
      present data on families that previously had been diagnosed as having the fragile 
      X syndrome but that later were found to be negative for trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion at the FRAXA locus. In these families we demonstrate the presence of a 
      GCC trinucleotide repeat expansion at the FRAXE locus. Studies of the FRAXE locus 
      of normal individuals show that they have 6-25 copies of the repeat, whereas 
      affected individuals have > 200 copies. As in the fragile X syndrome, the 
      amplified CpG residues are methylated in affected males.

TI  - Enzymatic amplification of synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides: implications for 
      triplet repeat expansions in the human genome.
PG  - 19-24
AB  - The triplet repeat sequences (CGG)n, (GCT)n, and (CAG)n, which naturally occur in 
      the human genome, can be autonomously expanded in human DNA by an as yet unknown 
      mechanism. These in part excessive expansions have been causally related to human 
      genetic diseases, the fragile X (Martin-Bell) syndrome, to myotonic dystrophy 
      (Curschmann-Steinert), to spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (Kennedy disease), 
      and recently to Huntington disease. A GCC trinucleotide repeat was found to be 
      expanded and methylated in the fragile site FRAXE on the human X chromosome. 
      These findings were associated with mental retardation (Knight et al., 1993). In 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), a polymorphic CAG repeat was found to be 
      unstable and expanded in individuals with that disease (Orr et al., 1993). We 
      have demonstrated in in vitro experiments that the synthetic 
      oligodeoxyribonucleotides (CGG)17, (CGG)12, (GCC)17, (CG)25, (CTG)17, or (CAG)17 
      plus (GTC)17, in the absence of added natural DNA, can be expanded with Taq 
      polymerase in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Some expansion can already be 
      detected after 4 PCR cycles. The E. coli Klenow DNA polymerase also functions in 
      a similar amplification and expansion reaction performed at 37 degrees C without 
      cycling. Other oligodeoxyribonucleotides, like, (CGG)7, (CGGT)13, or (TAA)17, are 
      devoid of this property or have very low activity. The cytidine-methylated 
      polymers (GCC)17 or (CG)25 yield expansion products of considerably reduced chain 
      lengths. The expansion of the polymer (CGG)17 is affected by cytidine methylation 
      to a lesser degree. A specific sequence and/or secondary structure and high CG 
      content appear to be requirements for this expansion reaction by a possible 
      slippage mechanism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Trinucleotide repeat amplification and hypermethylation of a CpG island in FRAXE 
      mental retardation.
PG  - 127-34
AB  - We have cloned the fragile site FRAXE and demonstrate that individuals with this 
      fragile site possess amplifications of a GCC repeat adjacent to a CpG island in 
      Xq28 of the human X chromosome. Normal individuals have 6-25 copies of the GCC 
      repeat, whereas mentally retarded, FRAXE-positive individuals have > 200 copies 
      and also have methylation at the CpG island. This situation is similar to that 
      seen at the FRAXA locus and is another example in which a trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion is associated with a human genetic disorder. In contrast with the 
      fragile X syndrome, the GCC repeat can expand or contract and is equally unstable 
      when passed through the male or female line. These results also have implications 
      for the understanding of chromosome fragility.
