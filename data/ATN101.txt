TI  - The relationship between the number of CAG repeats and clinical manifestations: a 
      survey of Chinese DRPLA family.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical, radiological, and genetic characteristics of 
      a Chinese family with dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). Explore the 
      distribution of CAG repeat size to the clinical features of patients. METHODS: We 
      collected the clinical symptoms and DNA analysis for the DRPLA gene was performed 
      on the family members. DRPLA patients reported in the literature were reviewed to 
      analyze the association between CAG repeat size and clinical features. RESULTS: 
      Six family members were confirmed by genetic analysis. The number of CAG repeat 
      in the proband, her sister, her grandmother, her father, her uncle, and her 
      cousin, was determined respectively as 63, 75, 50, 50, 50, 54. In our family, the 
      sister of the proband had the earliest onset age and the most severe clinical 
      symptoms, followed by the proband, and other family members showed no obvious 
      clinical symptoms. Consistent with the conclusion of previous studies, the more 
      repeats CAG, the earlier the age of onset and the severer phenotypes are. 
      CONCLUSION: We found six family members have CAG repeat expansion in the DRPLA 
      gene on chromosome 12p13. Even in the same family, patients have different 
      clinical presentations. The size of CAG repeats is negatively correlated with the 
      age of onset and positively correlated with symptom severity. When the number of 
      repeats is >/= 63, the age at onset is < 21 years old, and obvious clinical 
      symptoms generally appear. It seems to say the more repeats CAG, the earlier the 
      age of onset and the severer phenotypes are. LIMITATIONS: With a small number of 
      cases in our family, the conclusion that the more CAG repeats, the earlier the 
      onset and the more severe the clinical symptoms cannot be fully proved.

TI  - Fast and reliable detection of repeat expansions in spinocerebellar ataxia using 
      exomes.
PG  - 717-721

AB  - Usually, molecular diagnosis of spinocerebellar ataxia is based on a step-by-step 
      approach with targeted sizing of four repeat expansions accounting for most 
      dominant cases, then targeted sequencing of other genes. Nowadays, genome 
      sequencing allows detection of most pathogenic variants in a single step. The 
      ExpansionHunter tool can detect expansions in short-read genome sequencing data. 
      Recent studies have shown that ExpansionHunter can also be used to identify 
      repeat expansions in exome sequencing data. We tested ExpansionHunter on 
      spinocerebellar ataxia exomes in a research context as a second-line analysis, 
      after exclusion of main CAG repeat expansions in half of the probands. First, we 
      confirmed the detection of expansions in seven known expansion carriers and then, 
      after targeted analysis of ATXN1, 2, 3 and 7, CACNA1A, TBP, ATN1, NOP56, AR and 
      HTT in 498 exomes, we found 22 additional pathogenic expansions. Comparison with 
      capillary migration sizing in 247 individuals and confirmation of all expanded 
      alleles detected by ExpansionHunter demonstrated that for these loci, sensitivity 
      and specificity reached 100%. ExpansionHunter detected but underestimated the 
      repeat size for larger expansions, and the normal alleles distribution at each 
      locus should be taken into account to detect expansions. Exome combined with 
      ExpansionHunter is reliable to detect repeat expansions in selected loci as 
      first-line analysis in spinocerebellar ataxia.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic efficacy of clinical 
      exome-targeted sequencing (CES) and spinocerebellar ataxia 36 (SCA36) screening 
      in a real-life cohort of patients with cerebellar ataxia (CA) from Eastern Spain. 
      METHODS: A total of 130 unrelated patients with CA, negative for common 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, 
      SCA17, dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy [DRPLA], and Friedreich ataxia), were 
      studied with CES. Bioinformatic and genotype-phenotype analyses were performed to 
      assess the pathogenicity of the variants encountered. Copy number variants were 
      analyzed when appropriate. In undiagnosed dominant and sporadic cases, repeat 
      primed PCR was used to screen for the presence of a repeat expansion in the NOP56 
      gene. RESULTS: CES identified pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 50 
      families (39%), including 23 novel variants. Overall, there was a high genetic 
      heterogeneity, and the most frequent genetic diagnosis was SPG7 (n = 15), 
      followed by SETX (n = 6), CACNA1A (n = 5), POLR3A (n = 4), and SYNE1 (n = 3). In 
      addition, 17 families displayed likely pathogenic/pathogenic variants in 14 
      different genes: KCND3 (n = 2), KIF1C (n = 2), CYP27A1A (n = 2), AFG3L2 (n = 1), 
      ANO10 (n = 1), CAPN1 (n = 1), CWF19L1 (n = 1), ITPR1 (n = 1), KCNA1 (n = 1), OPA1 
      (n = 1), PNPLA6 (n = 1), SPG11 (n = 1), SPTBN2 (n = 1), and TPP1 (n = 1). 
      Twenty-two novel variants were characterized. SCA36 was diagnosed in 11 families, 
      all with autosomal dominant (AD) presentation. SCA36 screening increased the 
      total diagnostic rate to 47% (n = 61/130). Ultimately, undiagnosed patients 
      showed delayed age at onset (p < 0.05) and were more frequently sporadic. 
      DISCUSSION: Our study provides insight into the genetic landscape of CA in 
      Eastern Spain. Although CES was an effective approach to capture genetic 
      heterogeneity, most patients remained undiagnosed. SCA36 was found to be a 
      relatively frequent form and, therefore, should be tested prior to CES in 
      familial AD presentations in particular geographical regions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Repeat expansion disorders affect about 1 in 3000 individuals and are 
      clinically heterogeneous diseases caused by expansions of short tandem DNA 
      repeats. Genetic testing is often locus-specific, resulting in underdiagnosis of 
      people who have atypical clinical presentations, especially in paediatric 
      patients without a previous positive family history. Whole genome sequencing is 
      increasingly used as a first-line test for other rare genetic disorders, and we 
      aimed to assess its performance in the diagnosis of patients with neurological 
      repeat expansion disorders. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed the diagnostic 
      accuracy of whole genome sequencing to detect the most common repeat expansion 
      loci associated with neurological outcomes (AR, ATN1, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, 
      C9orf72, CACNA1A, DMPK, FMR1, FXN, HTT, and TBP) using samples obtained within 
      the National Health Service in England from patients who were suspected of having 
      neurological disorders; previous PCR test results were used as the reference 
      standard. The clinical accuracy of whole genome sequencing to detect repeat 
      expansions was prospectively examined in previously genetically tested and 
      undiagnosed patients recruited in 2013-17 to the 100 000 Genomes Project in the 
      UK, who were suspected of having a genetic neurological disorder (familial or 
      early-onset forms of ataxia, neuropathy, spastic paraplegia, dementia, motor 
      neuron disease, parkinsonian movement disorders, intellectual disability, or 
      neuromuscular disorders). If a repeat expansion call was made using whole genome 
      sequencing, PCR was used to confirm the result. FINDINGS: The diagnostic accuracy 
      of whole genome sequencing to detect repeat expansions was evaluated against 793 
      PCR tests previously performed within the NHS from 404 patients. Whole genome 
      sequencing correctly classified 215 of 221 expanded alleles and 1316 of 1321 
      non-expanded alleles, showing 97.3% sensitivity (95% CI 94.2-99.0) and 99.6% 
      specificity (99.1-99.9) across the 13 disease-associated loci when compared with 
      PCR test results. In samples from 11 631 patients in the 100 000 Genomes Project, 
      whole genome sequencing identified 81 repeat expansions, which were also tested 
      by PCR: 68 were confirmed as repeat expansions in the full pathogenic range, 11 
      were non-pathogenic intermediate expansions or premutations, and two were 
      non-expanded repeats (16% false discovery rate). INTERPRETATION: In our study, 
      whole genome sequencing for the detection of repeat expansions showed high 
      sensitivity and specificity, and it led to identification of neurological repeat 
      expansion disorders in previously undiagnosed patients. These findings support 
      implementation of whole genome sequencing in clinical laboratories for diagnosis 
      of patients who have a neurological presentation consistent with a repeat 
      expansion disorder. FUNDING: Medical Research Council, Department of Health and

AB  - Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is a devastating genetic disease 
      presenting myoclonus, epilepsy, ataxia, and dementia. DRPLA is caused by the 
      expansion of a CAG repeat in the ATN1 gene. Aggregation of the 
      polyglutamine-expanded ATN1 protein causes neuro-degeneration of the 
      dentatorubral and pallidoluysian systems. The expanded CAG repeats are unstable, 
      and ongoing repeat expansions contribute to disease onset, progression, and 
      severity. Inducing contractions of expanded repeats can be a means to treat 
      DRPLA, for which no disease-modifying or curative therapies exist at present. 
      Previously, we characterized a small molecule, naphthyridine-azaquinolone (NA), 
      which binds to CAG slip-out structures and induces repeat contraction in 
      Huntington's disease mice. Here, we demonstrate that long-term 
      intracerebroventricular infusion of NA leads to repeat contraction, reductions in 
      mutant ATN1 aggregation, and improved motor phenotype in a murine model of DRPLA. 
      Furthermore, NA-induced contraction resulted in the modification of 
      repeat-length-dependent dysregulation of gene expression profiles in DRPLA mice. 
      Our study reveals the therapeutic potential of repeat contracting small molecules 
      for repeat expansion disorders, such as DRPLA.

TI  - DRPLA: understanding the natural history and developing biomarkers to accelerate 
      therapeutic trials in a globally rare repeat expansion disorder.
PG  - 3031-3041
LID - 10.1007/s00415-020-10218-6 [doi]
AB  - Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by CAG repeat expansions in the atrophin-1 gene and is inherited in an 
      autosomal dominant fashion. There are currently no disease-modifying treatments 
      available. The broad development of therapies for DRPLA, as well as other similar 
      rare diseases, has hit a roadblock due to the rarity of the condition and the 
      wide global distribution of patients and families, consequently inhibiting 
      biomarker development and therapeutic research. Considering the shifting focus 
      towards diverse populations, widespread genetic testing, rapid advancements in 
      the development of clinical and wet biomarkers for Huntington's disease (HD), and 
      the ongoing clinical trials for antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapies, the 
      prospect of developing effective treatments in rare disorders has completely 
      changed. The awareness of the HD ASO program has prompted global collaboration 
      for rare disorders in natural history studies and the development of biomarkers, 
      with the eventual goal of undergoing treatment trials. Here, we discuss DRPLA, 
      which shares similarities with HD, and how in this and other repeat expansion 
      disorders, neurogenetics groups like ours at UCL are gearing up for forthcoming 
      natural history studies to accelerate future ASO treatment trials to hopefully 
      emulate the progress seen in HD.

AB  - Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is an autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG nucleotide repeat expansion in 
      atrophin 1. A previous report described cerebellar white matter lesions on 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in elderly-onset DRPLA patients, but this 
      finding has not been fully investigated in a total population of DRPLA patients, 
      including juvenile or early-adult onset patients. Herein, we attempted to 
      determine the frequency, distribution pattern, and features of the cerebellar 
      white matter lesions in 30 consecutive DRPLA patients. We also assessed the 
      relationships between the cerebellar white matter lesions and clinical parameters 
      and other MRI findings. The cerebellar white matter lesions were found in 43% of 
      the 30 DRPLA patients, and in 70% of the late adult-onset DRPLA patients. In 
      approx. Two-thirds of the patients with cerebellar white matter lesions, the 
      lesions were localized in the paravermal area (paravermal lesions). Multiple 
      logistic regression analyses revealed that the Fazekas grade of 'cerebral' white 
      matter lesions was independently associated with 'cerebellar' white matter 
      lesions. In conclusion, cerebellar white matter lesions are one of the 
      distinctive MRI features in DRPLA patients, especially in patients with older age 
      at onset. Cerebellar white matter lesions, as well as cerebral white matter 
      lesions, might originate from the disease process of DRPLA itself, and they often 
      have a characteristic distribution of paravermal lesions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The diagnostic workup for choreiform movement disorders including 
      Huntington's disease (HD) and those mimicking HD like phenotype is complex. 
      OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to genetically define HD and HD-like 
      presentations in an Indian cohort. We also describe HTT-CAG expansion manifesting 
      as neuroferritinopathy-like disorder in four families from Punjab in India. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: 159 patients clinically diagnosed as HD and HD-like 
      presentations from various tertiary neurology clinics were referred to our centre 
      (CSIR-IGIB) for genetic investigations. As a first tier test, CAG-TNR for HTT was 
      performed and subsequently HD-negative samples were screened for JPH3 (HDL2), TBP 
      (SCA17), ATN1 (DRPLA), PPP2R2B (SCA12) and GGGGCC expansion in C9orf72 gene. Four 
      families presenting as neuroferritinopathy-like disorder were also investigated 
      for HTT-CAG expansion. RESULTS: 94 of 159 (59%) patients were found to have 
      expanded HTT-CAG repeats. Pathogenic repeat expansion in JPH3, TBP, ATN1 and 
      C9orf72 were not found in HD negative cases. Two patients were positive for 
      SCA12-CAG expansion in pathogenic length, whereas 5 cases harboured TBP-CAG 
      repeats falling in reduced penetrance range of 41- 48 repeats for SCA17. Four 
      unrelated families, presented with atypical chorea and brain MRI findings 
      suggestive of basal ganglia abnormalities mimicking neuroferritinopathy were 
      found to harbour HTT-CAG expansion. CONCLUSION: We present SCA12 as a new 
      reported phenocopy of HD which should be considered for diagnostic workout along 
      with SCA17 for HD-like syndromes. This study also illustrates the necessity, to 
      consider evolving HD like phenotype, as a clinical diagnosis for cases with 
      initial manifestations depicting neuroferritinopathy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: There is a great deal of heterogeneity, both phenotypically and 
      genotypically among the autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA). Their 
      prevalence also varies in different populations. Trinucleotide repeat expansions 
      (CTG/CAG) have been shown predominantly to cause a number of ADCAs. AIM: The 
      present study describes the frequency of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) and the 
      CAG repeat sizes among the different regions of India. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: 
      Molecular data from our central reference laboratory were retrospectively 
      analyzed for SCAs 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 12, 17 and DRPLA. Correlation between age at 
      diagnosis and the CAG repeats of the expanded and the normal alleles were tested 
      with the Spearman correlation test. RESULTS: The presence of SCAs vary according 
      to geographical regions and ethnicities; SCA 12 was detected with the highest 
      frequency (229/901), but was restricted to a specific ethnic population, followed 
      by SCA 2 with a positivity of 12% (101/845). SCA 3 previously known as 
      Machado-Joseph Disease had a prevalence of 4.05% (32/789), whereas SCA 1 was 
      diagnosed in 30/773 (3.88%). No positivity was seen for SCA 10 from the 103 
      samples tested and for SCA 17 from the 131 samples tested either as a part of an 
      extended panel or stand-alone. CONCLUSION: In this report, we are able to expand 
      the portrait of SCAs in India by presenting the largest ever molecular data from 
      a central reference laboratory.

AB  - Dentato-Rubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is a rare autosomal, dominant, 
      progressive neurodegenerative disease that causes involuntary movements, mental 
      and emotional problems. DRPLA is caused by a mutation in the ATN1 gene that 
      encodes for an abnormal polyglutamine stretch in the atrophin-1 protein. DRPLA is 
      most common in the Japanese population, where it has an estimated incidence of 2 
      to 7 per million people. This condition has also been seen in families from North 
      America and Europe. We obtained a reprogrammed iPSC line from a Caucasian patient 
      with a juvenile onset of the disease, carrying 64 CAG repeat expansion in the 
      ATN1 gene.

AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, characterised 
      by a triad of movement disorder, emotional and behavioural disturbances and 
      cognitive impairment. The underlying cause is an expanded CAG repeat in the 
      huntingtin gene. For a small proportion of patients presenting with HD-like 
      symptoms, the mutation in this gene is not identified and they are said to have a 
      HD "phenocopy". South Africa has the highest number of recorded cases of an 
      African-specific phenocopy, Huntington disease-like 2 (HDL2), caused by a repeat 
      expansion in the junctophilin-3 gene. However, a significant proportion of black 
      patients with clinical symptoms suggestive of HD still test negative for HD and 
      HDL2. This study thus aimed to investigate five other loci associated with HD 
      phenocopy syndromes - ATN1, ATXN2, ATXN7, TBP and C9orf72. In a sample of 
      patients in whom HD and HDL2 had been excluded, a single expansion was identified 
      in the ATXN2 gene, confirming a diagnosis of Spinocerebellar ataxia 2. The 
      results indicate that common repeat expansion disorders do not contribute 
      significantly to the HD-like phenotype in black South African patients. 
      Importantly, allele sizing reveals unique distributions of normal repeat lengths 
      across the associated loci in the African population studied.

AB  - Cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat expansions in the coding regions of nine 
      polyglutamine (polyQ) genes (HTT, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, ATN1, AR, 
      and TBP) are the cause of several neurodegenerative diseases including 
      Huntington's disease (HD), six different spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, and spinobulbar muscular atrophy. The 
      expanded CAG repeat length in the causative gene is negatively related to the 
      age-at-onset (AAO) of clinical symptoms. In addition to the expanded CAG repeat 
      length in the causative gene, the normal CAG repeats in the other polyQ genes can 
      affect the AAO, suggesting functional interactions between the polyQ genes. 
      However, there is no detailed assessment of the relationships among polyQ genes 
      in pathologically relevant brain regions. We used gene co-expression analysis to 
      study the functional relationships among polyQ genes in different brain regions 
      using the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA), a spatial map of gene expression in the 
      healthy brain. We constructed co-expression networks for seven anatomical brain 
      structures, as well as a region showing a specific pattern of atrophy in HD 
      patients detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. In this 
      HD-associated region, we found that ATN1 and ATXN2 were co-expressed and shared 
      co-expression partners which were enriched for DNA repair genes. We observed a 
      similar co-expression pattern in the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, and striatum in 
      which this relation was most pronounced. Given that the co-expression patterns 
      for these anatomical structures were similar to those for the HD-associated 
      region, our results suggest that their disruption is likely involved in HD 
      pathology. Moreover, ATN1 and ATXN2 also shared many co-expressed genes with HTT, 
      the causative gene of HD, across the brain. Although this triangular relationship 
      among these three polyQ genes may also be dysregulated in other polyQ diseases, 
      stronger co-expression patterns between ATN1 and ATXN2 observed in the 
      HD-associated region, especially in the striatum, may be more specific to HD.

      sensory neuropathy.
PG  - e123
LID - e123
AB  - Spinocerebellar degeneration (SCD) is a group of disorders characterized by 
      progressive ataxia caused by dysfunction and atrophy of the cerebellum or its 
      projections. Approximately one-third of SCD cases are familial SCD, the majority 
      of which are attributed to CAG triplet repeat expansions including 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)1, SCA2, Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)/SCA3, SCA6, 
      SCA8, SCA12, SCA17, and dentate-rubro-pallido-luysian atrophy (DRPLA). The 
      triplet repeat number of the alleles representing complete penetrance varies 
      among diseases. Generally, there is a gap between the normal alleles and the 
      complete penetrance alleles. Rarely, intermediate alleles with the repeat numbers 
      between the abnormal and normal ranges are observed, although the implications of 
      these intermediate alleles remain ambiguous.

TI  - Expanding the Spectrum of Genes Involved in Huntington Disease Using a Combined 
      Clinical and Genetic Approach.
PG  - 1105-14
LID - 10.1001/jamaneurol.2016.2215 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Huntington disease (HD), a prototypic monogenic disease, is caused by 
      an expanded CAG repeat in the HTT gene exceeding 35 units. However, not all 
      patients with an HD phenotype carry the pathological expansion in HTT, and the 
      positive diagnosis rate is poor. OBJECTIVES: To examine patients with HD 
      phenotypes to determine the frequency of HD phenocopies with typical features of 
      HD but without pathological CAG repeat expansions in HTT in an attempt to improve 
      the positive diagnosis rate. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between January 
      1, 2004, and April 18, 2011, a total of 226 consecutive index patients with an HD 
      phenotype were referred to specialized clinics of the French National Huntington 
      Disease Reference Centre for Rare Diseases. They underwent detailed clinical 
      examination and follow-up, as well as neuropsychological, biological, imaging, 
      and genetic examinations. Nucleotide expansions in JPH3, ATN1, TBP, and C9ORF72 
      and mutations in PRNP, as well as acquired conditions commonly causing HD 
      phenocopies, were first screened. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The diagnostic rate 
      of HD phenocopies and frequency of other etiologies using deep clinical 
      phenotyping and next generation sequencing. Our goal was to improve the genetic 
      diagnosis of HD phenocopies and to identify new HD related genes. RESULTS: One 
      hundred ninety-eight patients carried a pathological CAG repeat expansion in HTT, 
      whereas 28 patients (12 women and 16 men) did not. Huntington disease phenocopies 
      accounted for 12.4%, and their mean (SD) age at onset was similar to those of the 
      HD-HTT group (47.3 [12.7] years vs 50.3 [16.4] years, P = .29). We first 
      identified 3 patients with abnormal CTG expansions in JPH3, a fourth patient with 
      an antiphospholipid syndrome, and a fifth patient with B12 avitaminosis. A 
      custom-made 63-gene panel was generated based on clinical evolution and exome 
      sequencing. It contained genes responsible for HD phenocopies and other 
      neurodegenerative conditions, as well as candidate genes from exome sequencing in 
      3 index cases with imaging features of brain iron accumulation. We identified 
      mutations in genes associated with neurodegeneration, including CACNA1A (n = 2), 
      VPS13A (n = 1), UBQLN2 (n = 1), and VCP (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      Huntington disease phenocopies without CAG repeat expansions in HTT are not rare, 
      occurring in 12.4% (28 of 226) herein, and should be considered in genetic 
      counseling. We used next-generation sequencing combined with clinical data and 
      disease evolution to explore multiple etiologies simultaneously. Our combined 
      clinical and genetic exploration of 28 HD phenocopies identified the underlying 
      cause in 35.7% (10 of 28). In conclusion, the etiologies of HD phenocopies are 
      heterogeneous, and clinical evolution should be taken into account when searching 
      for a genetic cause. The panel of candidate genes to be examined is larger than 
      expected but can be guided by specific imaging and clinical features. Other 
      neurodegenerative diseases with late onset in which variant segregation cannot be 
      verified could be productively explored with the combined approach illustrated 
      herein.

      spinocerebellar ataxia: a Thai multicentre study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: About 50 % of Thai patients with adult-onset spinocerebellar ataxia 
      (SCA) was Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), SCA1, SCA2 and SCA6. The author 
      investigated further on less common SCAs in the patients without any known 
      mutations. METHODS: DNA samples of 82 index patients who were genetically 
      excluded MJD, SCA1, SCA2, SCA6, SCA7 and dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy 
      (DRPLA) were examined. Analysis of SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, SCA17 and SCA19 genes were 
      comprehensively performed. Normal range of trinucleotide repeat expansion sizes 
      of TATA-box-binding protein gene (TBP) were also determined in 374 control 
      subjects. RESULTS: Eight patients carried >/=42 CAG/CAA repeat allele in the TBP 
      consistent with SCA17. The pathological repeat alleles ranged from 42 to 57 
      repeats. All patients had significant degree of cognitive dysfunction. Other 
      non-ataxic phenotypes comprised of parkinsonism, chorea, dystonia and myoclonus. 
      A sporadic patient carried a heterozygous 41-repeat allele developed chronic 
      progressive cerebellar degeneration commenced at the age of 28 years. Whilst, 2 % 
      of the control subjects (8/374) carried the 41-repeat allele. Five of the 
      carriers were re-examined, and revealed that four of them had parkinsonism and/or 
      cognitive impairment without cerebellar signs. Analysis of other types of SCAs 
      was all negative. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study of SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, 
      SCA17 and SCA19 in Thais. SCA17 appears to be an important cause of ataxia in 
      Thailand. Although, the pathological cut-off point of the TBP repeat allele 
      remains unclear, the finding suggests that the 41-repeat may be a pathological 
      allele resulting late-onset or mild phenotype. Apart from ataxia, cognitive 
      impairment and parkinsonism may be clinical presentations in these carriers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the association of repeat expansion size in 10 common 
      degenerative hereditary ataxia genes with essential tremor. These genes were 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)-1 (ATXN1), SCA-2 (ATXN2), SCA-3 (ATXN3), SCA-6 
      (CACNA1A), SCA-7 (ATXN7), SCA-8 (ATXN8OS), SCA-10 (ATXN10), SCA-12 (PPP2R2B), 
      SCA-17 (TBP) and dentatorubral-pallidolysian atrophy (DRPLA) (ATN1). METHODS: 
      Genetic analysis of repeat size in 10 degenerative hereditary ataxia loci was 
      performed in 323 essential tremor patients and 299 controls enrolled at Columbia 
      University. To test for differences in the allele distribution between patients 
      and controls, a CLUMP analysis was performed. RESULTS: None of the essential 
      tremor patients had a repeat expansion in the intermediate or pathogenic range. 
      Significant differences in the distribution of repeats in the 'normal' range for 
      SCA2 and SCA8 (both p </= 0.02) were observed between essential tremor patients and 
      controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that pathogenic repeat expansions in 
      SCA loci are not associated with essential tremor.

TI  - The first identified Central-Eastern European patient with genetically confirmed 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy.
PG  - 68-71
AB  - AIMS: Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is an inherited 
      neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a trinucleotide repeat expansion. The 
      disease mainly occurs amongst the Japanese and is extremely rare in the European 
      population. The characteristic clinical symptoms are cerebellar ataxia, dementia, 
      choreoathetoid movements, epileptic seizures and myoclonus. The aim of this study 
      is to present the first genetically confirmed Hungarian case of DRPLA. CASE 
      REPORT: The middle-aged female patient developed the characteristic clinical 
      symptoms except myoclonus over her late thirties with positive family history. 
      The major finding in the skull magnetic resonance imaging was the atrophy of 
      infratentorial brain structures with the consequential dilation of related 
      cerebrospinal fluid spaces. A detailed neuropsychological examination was also 
      performed and it revealed moderate cognitive dysfunctions, mild depression and 
      anxiety. As underlying conditions, Huntington's disease and common 
      spinocerebellar ataxia forms all came into consideration, but all the result of 
      the respective genetic tests were negative. However, the test for mutation in the 
      ATN1 gene revealed pathological heterozygous CAG repeat expansion. CONCLUSION: 
      This case study serves as the first description of genetically confirmed DRPLA in 
      the Central-Eastern region of Europe, the clinical features of which seems to be 
      very similar to the previously reported cases.

AB  - Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a clinical and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of debilitating neurodegenerative diseases that are related 
      to at least 36 different genetic loci; they are clinically characterized by 
      progressive cerebellar ataxia and are frequently accompanied by other 
      neurological and non-neurological manifestations. The relative frequency of SCA 
      varies greatly among different regions, presumably because of a founder effect or 
      local ethnicities. Between July 1998 and May 2012, we investigated 320 Brazilian 
      patients with an SCA phenotype who belonged to 150 unrelated families with an 
      autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and 23 sporadic patients from 13 Brazilian 
      states. A total of 265 patients (82.8%) belonging to 131 unrelated families 
      (87.3%) were found to have a definite mutation, and SCA3 accounted for most of 
      the familial cases (70.7%), followed by SCA7 (6%), SCA1 (5.3%), SCA2 (2.7%), SCA6 
      (1.3%), SCA8 (0.7%) and SCA10 (0.7%). In the Ribeirao Preto mesoregion, which is 
      located in the northeast part of Sao Paulo State, the prevalence of SCA3 was 
      approximately 5 per 100,000 inhabitants, which is the highest prevalence found in 
      Brazil. No mutation was found in the SCA12, SCA17 and DRPLA genes, and all the 
      sporadic cases remained without a molecular diagnosis. This study further 
      characterizes the spectrum of SCA mutations found in Brazilian patients, which 
      suggests the existence of regional differences and demonstrates the expansion of 
      the SCA8 locus in Brazilian families.

      genes.
PG  - 2444-55
LID - 10.1093/brain/awu174 [doi]
AB  - Polyglutamine-coding (CAG)n repeat expansions in seven different genes cause 
      spinocerebellar ataxias. Although the size of the expansion is negatively 
      correlated with age at onset, it accounts for only 50-70% of its variability. To 
      find other factors involved in this variability, we performed a regression 
      analysis in 1255 affected individuals with identified expansions (spinocerebellar 
      ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7), recruited through the European Consortium on 
      Spinocerebellar Ataxias, to determine whether age at onset is influenced by the 
      size of the normal allele in eight causal (CAG)n-containing genes (ATXN1-3, 6-7, 
      17, ATN1 and HTT). We confirmed the negative effect of the expanded allele and 
      detected threshold effects reflected by a quadratic association between age at 
      onset and CAG size in spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 3 and 6. We also evidenced 
      an interaction between the expanded and normal alleles in trans in individuals 
      with spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 6 and 7. Except for individuals with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, age at onset was also influenced by other 
      (CAG)n-containing genes: ATXN7 in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2; ATXN2, ATN1 and 
      HTT in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3; ATXN1 and ATXN3 in spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 6; and ATXN3 and TBP in spinocerebellar ataxia type 7. This suggests that 
      there are biological relationships among these genes. The results were partially 
      replicated in four independent populations representing 460 Caucasians and 216 
      Asian samples; the differences are possibly explained by ethnic or geographical 
      differences. As the variability in age at onset is not completely explained by

AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an X-linked motor neuron disease 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the androgen receptor (AR) gene. 
      Ligand-dependent nuclear accumulation of mutant AR protein is a critical 
      characteristic of the pathogenesis of SBMA. SBMA has been modeled in 
      AR-overexpressing animals, but precisely how the polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion 
      leads to neurodegeneration is unclear. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are 
      a new technology that can be used to model human diseases, study pathogenic 
      mechanisms, and develop novel drugs. We established SBMA patient-derived iPSCs, 
      investigated their cellular biochemical characteristics, and found that 
      SBMA-iPSCs can differentiate into motor neurons. The CAG repeat numbers in the AR 
      gene of SBMA-iPSCs and also in the atrophin-1 gene of iPSCs derived from another 
      polyQ disease, dentato-rubro-pallido-luysian atrophy (DRPLA), remain unchanged 
      during reprogramming, long term passage, and differentiation, indicating that 
      polyQ disease-associated CAG repeats are stable during maintenance of iPSCs. The 
      level of AR expression is up-regulated by neuronal differentiation and treatment 
      with the AR ligand dihydrotestosterone. Filter retardation assays indicated that 
      aggregation of ARs following dihydrotestosterone treatment in neurons derived 
      from SBMA-iPSCs increases significantly compared with neurological control iPSCs, 
      easily recapitulating the pathological feature of mutant ARs in SBMA-iPSCs. This 
      phenomenon was not observed in iPSCs and fibroblasts, thereby showing the 
      neuron-dominant phenotype of this disease. Furthermore, the HSP90 inhibitor 
      17-allylaminogeldanamycin sharply decreased the level of aggregated AR in neurons 
      derived from SBMA-iPSCs, indicating a potential for discovery and validation of 
      candidate drugs. We found that SBMA-iPSCs possess disease-specific biochemical 
      features and could thus open new avenues of research into not only SBMA, but also 
      other polyglutamine diseases.

AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) encompass a heterogeneous group of 
      rare diseases that affect the cerebellum and its connections. The most common 
      forms have been associated with dynamic mutations while some rarer forms with 
      conventional mutations. Studies in different populations revealed differences in 
      their relative frequencies both within and between the studied populations, 
      showing that the frequencies are depended on ethnic and geographical factors. 
      Previous investigation of triplet repeat expansion SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, 
      SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, SCA17 and DRPLA) in the Cypriot population, revealed no 
      pathogenic expansion in the Cypriot SCA patients. We hereby present our recent 
      investigation of the SCA10 pentanucleotide repeat expansion. Forty-two 
      ascertained Cypriot sporadic ataxia patients, the index case from 1 ADCA and 14 
      ARCA families and a cohort of normal population individuals were included in the 
      study. All our patients have normal range ATXN10 gene ATTCT repeat numbers 
      (10-19). In the normal population group, repeat lengths ranged from 11 to 20 with 
      the 14 repeats allele being the most frequent. Therefore, all currently 
      established dynamic repeat SCA mutations are absent from the Cypriot population, 
      indicating distinct genetic causes.

AB  - To elucidate a relationship between CAG repeat expansion length and disease 
      progression history in patients with childhood-onset dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA). We retrospectively evaluated information from nine Japanese 
      patients with disease onset reported as between 6 months and 12 years of age. CAG 
      repeat length in these patients ranged from 62 to 93. A strong correlation was 
      confirmed for the age of disease onset, with the onset of epilepsy and 
      involuntary movements, emergence of regression, and autonomic symptoms. The age 
      at becoming wheelchair-bound and initiation of tube feeding also showed a 
      significant correlation with CAG repeat length. This is the first report 
      detailing this aspect of DRPLA focusing on the childhood-onset population. 
      Earlier disease milestones were revealed compared to the expected age based upon 
      a previous report that contained data from the entire patient population, 
      including adult-onset cases (Hasegawa et al. in Mov Disord 25:1694-1700, 2010). 
      These results provide a basis for predicting the outcome of patients in this 
      particular age group, as well as for assessing the results of future clinical 
      therapeutic trials.

TI  - Analysis of spinocerebellar ataxias due to expanded triplet repeats in Greek 
      patients with cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 178-80
LID - 10.1016/j.jns.2012.03.019 [doi]
AB  - The relative frequency of different autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias, 
      commonly referred to as spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), varies considerably among 
      populations of different ethnic origin. No data exist at present on the frequency 
      of different SCAs in the Greek population. In the present study we investigated 
      the presence of triplet repeat expansion SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, 
      SCA8, SCA12, SCA17 and DRPLA) in a cohort of 83 Greek patients with slowly 
      progressive cerebellar ataxia. Twenty patients came from autosomal dominant (AD) 
      pedigrees, seven displayed recessive or unclear inheritance and 56 were sporadic. 
      We found four patients with pathological SCA expansions, all from AD pedigrees. 
      Two patients had SCA1, one SCA2 and one SCA7 (10.0, 5.0 and 5.0% of the AD group, 
      respectively). The clinical features of these patients were within the expected 
      spectrum. In total, a pathological expansion was detected in 20% of patients from 
      AD pedigrees. Interestingly, no cases of SCA3 or SCA6 were detected in the AD 
      group. No expansions were found in other familial cases or in sporadic patients. 
      Overall, no cases of SCA3, SCA6, SCA12, SCA17 or DRPLA were identified in the 
      Greek population. In conclusion, SCA1, SCA2 and SCA7 are present in Greek 
      patients with AD cerebellar ataxia in frequencies similar to those observed in 
      other populations. SCA3 and SCA6 appear however to be rare in Greece. The genetic 
      cause for the majority of AD ataxias remains to be identified.

TI  - Long-term disability and prognosis in dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy: a 
      correlation with CAG repeat length.
PG  - 1694-700
LID - 10.1002/mds.23167 [doi]
AB  - Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is a rare autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by CAG repeat expansion. Previous studies 
      demonstrated that the onset of DRPLA is closely associated with CAG repeat 
      length. However, the natural history of DRPLA has not yet been evaluated. We here 
      retrospectively investigated the factors that determine the disease milestones 
      and prognosis in 183 Japanese patients genetically diagnosed with DRPLA. We 
      determined the age at onset, age at which each of the subsequent clinical 
      manifestations appeared, age at becoming wheelchair-bound, and age at death. 
      Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the patients with CAG repeats larger than the 
      median length of 65 repeats developed each of the clinical features of DRPLA at a 
      younger age than those with <65 repeats. The patients became wheelchair-bound at 
      a median age of 33 years (n = 61; range, 3-77 years) and died at a median age of 
      49 years (n = 23; range, 18-80 years). The ages at becoming wheelchair-bound and 
      at death strongly correlated with the expanded CAG repeat length. Moreover, the 
      patients with >or=65 CAG repeats showed a more severe long-term disability and a 
      poorer prognosis. In contrast, the rate of progression after the onset did not 
      correlate with CAG repeat length. The CAG repeat length may have a considerable 
      effect on not only the disease onset but also the disease milestones and 
      prognosis in DRPLA patients. These effects of CAG repeat length may be relevant 
      in designing future clinical therapeutic trials.

TI  - SCA-LSVD: a repeat-oriented locus-specific variation database for genotype to 
      phenotype correlations in spinocerebellar ataxias.
PG  - 1037-42
LID - 10.1002/humu.21006 [doi]
AB  - Repeat expansion has been implicated in 10 out of 17 candidate genes identified 
      for autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs)-commonly referred as 
      spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). Though genetically distinct, the SCAs share a 
      large number of features that confound their clinical classification. In 
      addition, there is a difference in the prevalence and phenotypic expression of 
      ataxias between different ethnic groups. We have created a new SCA-locus-specific 
      variation database (LSVD) that aims to catalog and integrate information on SCAs 
      associated with trinucleotide repeat expansion (SCA1, SCA 2, SCA 3, SCA 6, SCA 7, 
      SCA 8, SCA 12, SCA 17, Friedreich's ataxia [FRDA], and 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy [DRPLA]) from all over the world. The 
      database has been developed using the Leiden Open (source) Variation Database 
      (LOVD) software (Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands). The 
      database houses detailed information on clinical features, such as age and 
      symptom at onset, mode of inheritance, and genotype information, pertaining to 
      the SCA patients from more than 400 families across India. All the compiled 
      genotype data conforms to the HGVS Nomenclature guidelines. This would be a very 
      useful starting point for understanding the molecular correlates of phenotypes in 
      ataxia-a multilocus disease in which related molecular mechanisms converge to 
      overlapping phenotypes.

TI  - Molecular analysis of CAG repeats at five different spinocerebellar ataxia loci: 
      correlation and alternative explanations for disease pathogenesis.
PG  - 338-42
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are caused by expansion of (CAG)n triplet repeats. 
      These repeats occur as polymorphic forms in general population; however, beyond a 
      threshold size they become pathogenic. The sizes and distributions of repeats at 
      the SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA7 and DRPLA loci were assessed by molecular analysis of 
      124 unrelated ataxia patients and 44 controls, and the association of larger 
      normal (LN) alleles with disease prevalence was evaluated. Triplet repeat 
      expansions in the disease range were detected in 8% (10/124) of the cases, with 
      the majority having expansion at the SCA1 locus. Normal allele ranges in the 
      cohort studied were similar to the Caucasian and North Indian populations but 
      differed from the Korean and Japanese populations at various loci. The percentage 
      of individuals with LN alleles at the SCA1 and SCA2 loci was higher than reported 
      in Indians, Japanese and Caucasians. LN alleles showed a good correlation with 
      the incidence of SCA1, indicating that SCA1 is the most prevalent ataxia in our 
      population. The majority of cases with clinical symptoms of SCA could not be 
      diagnosed by established CAG repeat criteria, suggesting that there may be an 
      alternative basis for disease pathogenesis: (i) Repeats lower than the normal 
      range may also result in abnormal phenotypes (ii) LN alleles at different loci in 
      the same individual may contribute to symptoms (iii) Exogenous factors may play a 
      role in triggering disease symptoms in individuals with LN alleles (iv) Triplet 
      repeats may reach the disease range in the brain but not in the blood.

TI  - Case control analysis of repeat expansion size in ataxia.
PG  - 28-32
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of clinically and genetically 
      heterogeneous neurological diseases. The expansion of unstable microsatellite 
      repeats has been identified as the underlying pathogenic cause of 10 subtypes of 
      autosomal dominant SCAs. The aetiology of sporadic SCA is unknown. The aim of 
      this study was to investigate the effect of large normal repeats in patients 
      presenting with sporadic or familial ataxia compared to a control population. The 
      size of the expansion was determined using a fluorescent PCR approach in 10 
      common SCA genes: SCA-1 (ATXN1), SCA-2 (ATXN2), SCA-3 (ATXN3), SCA-6 (CACNA1A), 
      SCA-7 (ATXN7), SCA-8 (ATXN8OS), SCA-10 (ATXN10), SCA-12 (PPP2R2B), SCA-17 (TBP) 
      and DRPLA (ATN1), in 165 ataxia patients and 307 controls of Welsh origin. There 
      was no difference between cases and controls in the distribution of the large 
      normal alleles, or in the distribution of the combined CAG repeats. The normal 
      allele distribution in the Welsh population was largely similar to that of other 
      Caucasian populations. Our study failed to demonstrate an effect of large normal 
      repeats on the susceptibility to develop ataxia.

TI  - Multiplex families with multiple system atrophy.
PG  - 545-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple system atrophy (MSA) has been considered a sporadic disease, 
      without patterns of inheritance. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical features of 
      4 multiplex families with MSA, including clinical genetic aspects. DESIGN: 
      Clinical and genetic study. SETTING: Four departments of neurology in Japan. 
      Patients Eight patients in 4 families with parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, and 
      autonomic failure with age at onset ranging from 58 to 72 years. Two siblings in 
      each family were affected with these conditions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical 
      evaluation was performed according to criteria by Gilman et al. Trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion in the responsible genes for the spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 
      series and for dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) was evaluated by 
      polymerase chain reaction. Direct sequence analysis of coding regions in the 
      alpha-synuclein gene was performed. RESULTS: Consanguineous marriage was observed 
      in 1 of 4 families. Among 8 patients, 1 had definite MSA, 5 had probable MSA, and 
      2 had possible MSA. The most frequent phenotype was MSA with predominant 
      parkinsonism, observed in 5 patients. Six patients showed pontine atrophy with 
      cross sign or slitlike signal change at the posterolateral putaminal margin or 
      both on brain magnetic resonance imaging. Possibilities of hereditary ataxias, 
      including SCA1 (ataxin 1, ATXN1), SCA2 (ATXN2), Machado-Joseph disease/SCA3 
      (ATXN1), SCA6 (ATXN1), SCA7 (ATXN7), SCA12 (protein phosphatase 2, regulatory 
      subunit B, beta isoform; PP2R2B), SCA17 (TATA box binding protein, TBP) and DRPLA 
      (atrophin 1; ATN1), were excluded, and no mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene 
      were found. CONCLUSIONS: Findings in these multiplex families suggest the 
      presence of familial MSA with autosomal recessive inheritance and a genetic 
      predisposition to MSA. Molecular genetic approaches focusing on familial MSA are 
      expected to provide clues to the pathogenesis of MSA.

TI  - Exclusion of mutations in the PRNP, JPH3, TBP, ATN1, CREBBP, POU3F2 and FTL genes 
      as a cause of disease in Portuguese patients with a Huntington-like phenotype.
PG  - 645-651
LID - 10.1007/s10038-006-0001-9 [doi]
AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterised by chorea, cognitive impairment, dementia and personality changes, 
      caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat in the HD gene. Often, patients with a 
      similar clinical presentation do not carry expansions of the CAG repeat in this 
      gene [Huntington disease-like (HDL) patients]. We report the genetic analysis of 
      107 Portuguese patients with an HDL phenotype. The HDL genes PRNP and JPH3, 
      encoding the prion protein and junctophilin-3, respectively, were screened for 
      repeat expansions in these patients. Given the partial clinical overlap of SCA17, 
      DRPLA and neuroferritinopathy with HD, their causative genes (TBP, ATN1, and FTL, 
      respectively) were also analysed. Finally, repeat expansions in two candidate 
      genes, CREBBP and POU3F2, which encode the nuclear transcriptional coactivator 
      CREB-binding protein and the CNS-specific transcription factor N-Oct-3, 
      respectively, were also studied. Expansions of the repetitive tracts of the PRNP, 
      JPH3, TBP, ATN1, CREBBP and POU3F2 genes were excluded in all patients, as were 
      sequence alterations in the FTL gene. Since none of the genes already included in 
      the differential diagnosis of HD was responsible for the disease in our sample, 
      the genetic heterogeneity of the HDL phenotype is still open for investigation.

TI  - SCA28, a novel form of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia on chromosome 
      18p11.22-q11.2.
PG  - 235-42
AB  - We describe a four-generation Italian family with a novel form of juvenile-onset, 
      slowly progressive, autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia. Eleven affected family 
      members have been evaluated. The mean age at onset was 19.5 years with no 
      evidence of anticipation. The first symptoms were invariably unbalanced standing 
      and mild gait incoordination. Gaze-evoked nystagmus was prominent at onset, while 
      patients with longer disease duration developed slow saccades, ophthalmoparesis 
      and, often, ptosis. Deep tendon reflexes in lower limbs were increased in 80% of 
      the cases. Genetic analysis excluded the presence of pathological repeat 
      expansions in spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1-3, 6-8, 10, 12 and 17, and 
      DRPLA genes. Linkage exclusion tests showed no evidence of association with other 
      known SCA loci. A genome-wide screen analysis identified linkage with chromosome 
      18 markers. A maximum two-point limit of determination score of 4.20 was found 
      for marker D18S53. Haplotype analysis refined a critical region of 7.9 Mb between 
      markers D18S1418 and D18S1104. This new SCA locus on 18p11.22-q11.2 has been 
      designated SCA28. Candidate genes within the critical interval are currently 
      screened for mutations.

TI  - Cytoprotective effect of novel histone deacetylase inhibitors against 
      polyglutamine toxicity.
PG  - 213-5
AB  - Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is an autosomal dominant 
      neurological disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the DRPLA gene encoding 
      polyglutamine (polyQ). Although previous experimental studies have demonstrated 
      that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are therapeutically active, known HDAC 
      inhibitors have considerable adverse effects clinically. To identify new HDAC 
      inhibitors for the treatment of DRPLA, we evaluated a new series of HDAC 
      inhibitors, N-hydroxycarboxamides, with our drug screening system, which uses 
      neuronal PC12 cells stably transfected with a part of the DRPLA gene. We found 
      that two of four N-hydroxycarboxamides significantly reduced polyQ-induced cell 
      death. The essential structure of these compounds is a hydroxamic acid residue, 
      which is shared with trichostatin A, a known HDAC inhibitor. Although our study 
      showed mild neuroprotective effects, further structural modification of compounds 
      that retain this residue may decrease cytotoxicity and increase protective 
      activity against polyQ toxicity.

TI  - Comparative genetics of functional trinucleotide tandem repeats in humans and 
      apes.
PG  - 329-39
AB  - Several human neurodegenerative disorders are caused by the expansion of 
      polymorphic trinucleotide repeat regions. Many of these loci are functional short 
      tandem repeats (STRs) located in brain-expressed genes, and their study is thus 
      relevant from both a medical and an evolutionary point of view. The aims of our 
      study are to infer the comparative pattern of variation and evolution of this set 
      of loci in order to show species-specific features in this group of STRs and on 
      their potential for expansion (therefore, an insight into evolutionary medicine) 
      and to unravel whether any human-specific feature may be identified in 
      brain-expressed genes involved in human disease. We analyzed the variability of 
      the normal range of seven expanding STR CAG/CTG loci (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3-MJD, SCA6, 
      SCA8, SCA12, and DRPLA) and two nonexpanding polymorphic CAG loci (KCNN3 and 
      NCOA3) in humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. The study showed a 
      general conservation of the repetitive tract and of the polymorphism in the four 
      species and high heterogeneity among loci distributions. Humans present slightly 
      larger alleles than the rest of species but a more relevant difference appears in 
      variability levels: Humans are the species with the largest variance, although 
      only for the expanding loci, suggesting a relationship between variability levels 
      and expansion potential. The sequence analysis shows high levels of sequence 
      conservation among species, a lack of correspondence between interruption 
      patterns and variability levels, and signs of conservative selective pressure for 
      some of the STR loci. Only two loci (SCA1 and SCA8) show a human specific 
      distribution, with larger alleles than the rest of species. This could account, 
      at the same time, for a human-specific trait and a predisposition to disease 
      through expansion.

TI  - Molecular genetics of hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia: mutation analysis of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia genes and CAG/CTG repeat expansion detection in 225 
      Italian families.
PG  - 727-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias are a clinical and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of progressive neurodegenerative diseases, at present 
      associated with 22 loci (spinocerebellar ataxia [SCA] 1-SCA8, SCA10-SCA19, SCA21, 
      SCA22, fibroblast growth factor 14 [FGF14]-SCA, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy [DRPLA]). The relevant gene has been identified in 12 cases (SCA1-3, 
      SCA6-8, SCA10, SCA12, FGF14, and DRPLA), and in all but the recently identified 
      SCA14, SCA17, PRKCG and FGF14 genes, the defect consists of the expansion of a 
      short nucleotide repeat. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relative prevalence of 
      SCA1-3, SCA6-8, SCA10, SCA12, and SCA17 gene expansions in Italian families with 
      hereditary ataxia, specifically to verify the occurrence of SCA10, SCA12, and 
      SCA17 in Italy; and to analyze samples from probands with negative test results 
      at the initial screening by means of the repeat expansion detection technique to 
      identify CAG/CTG expansions in novel loci.Patients Two hundred twenty-five 
      unrelated Italian index cases with hereditary ataxia, most (n = 183) of whom 
      presented with a clear dominantly transmitted trait. RESULTS: We found that SCA1 
      and SCA2 gene mutations accounted for most cases (21% and 24%, respectively). We 
      found SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, and SCA17 to be very rare (approximately 1% each), 
      and no case of SCA10 or SCA12 was identified. Half of the index cases (113/225) 
      were negative for expansions in the known SCA genes. Repeat expansion detection 
      analysis performed on 111 of these cases showed a CAG/CTG repeat expansion of at 
      least 50 triplets in 22 (20%). Twenty-one of 22 expansions could be attributed to 
      length variation at 2 polymorphic loci (expanded repeat domain CAG/CTG 1 [ERDA1] 
      or CTG repeat on chromosome 18q21.1 [CTG18.1]). In 1 patient, the expansion was 
      assigned to the DRPLA gene. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of SCA1-3 and SCA6-7 
      gene mutations is peculiar in Italy. We found a relatively high frequency of SCA1 
      and SCA2 gene expansions; SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7 mutations were rare, compared with 
      other European countries. No SCA10 or SCA12 and only a few SCA8 (2/225) and SCA17 
      (2/225) families were detected. In patients negative for defects in known SCA 
      genes, repeat expansion detection data strongly suggest that, at least in our 
      population, CAG/CTG expansions in novel genes should be considered an unlikely 
      cause of the SCA phenotype.

TI  - Prevalence of dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy in a large series of white 
      patients with cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 1097-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is a rare 
      neurodegenerative disorder mainly diagnosed in Japan. Its prevalence is low in 
      other countries. Three phenotypes are described: choreoathetoid movements, 
      cerebellar ataxia, and progressive myoclonic epilepsy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the 
      frequency of DRPLA in European patients with sporadic or autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxia. METHODS: We analyzed a series of 809 index patients with 
      either autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (416 families) or progressive 
      cerebellar ataxia without a family history of the disease (393 cases) for the 
      DRPLA mutation. RESULTS: We identified a CAG repeat expansion in the DRPLA gene 
      in one family and in one patient without a family history. The familial case 
      illustrates the phenomenon of anticipation and the previously established 
      correlation between the phenotype and size of the expansion. A censored-history 
      family or expansion of large normal CAG repeats during paternal transmission 
      could be implicated in the patient without a family history. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      study enables us to estimate the frequency of the disease as 0.25% in both 
      families with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia and sporadic cases of ataxia 
      in our series, confirming the very low frequency of DRPLA in Europe. In both 
      familial and sporadic cases, molecular testing for DRPLA could be restricted to 
      patients with ataxia with one of the following features: chorea, dementia, or 
      myoclonic epilepsy.

TI  - Huntington's disease-like phenotype due to trinucleotide repeat expansions in the 
      TBP and JPH3 genes.
PG  - 1599-603
AB  - We report a group of 252 patients with a Huntington's disease-like (HDL) 
      phenotype, including 60 with typical Huntington's disease, who had tested 
      negative for pathological expansions in the IT15 gene, the major mutation in 
      Huntington's disease. They were screened for repeat expansions in two other genes 
      involved in HDL phenotypes: those encoding the junctophilin-3 (JPH3/HDL2) and 
      prion (PRNP/HDL1) proteins. In addition, because of the clinical overlap between 
      patients with HDL disease and autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia or 
      dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), we investigated trinucleotide 
      repeat expansions in genes encoding the TATA-binding protein (TBP/SCA17) and 
      atrophin-1 (DRPLA). Two patients carried 43 and 50 uninterrupted CTG repeats in 
      the JPH3 gene. Two other patients had 44 and 46 CAA/CAG repeats in the TBP gene. 
      Patients with expansions in the TBP or JPH3 genes had HDL phenotypes 
      indistinguishable from Huntington's disease. Taking into account patients with 
      typical Huntington's disease, their frequencies were evaluated as 3% each in our 
      series of typical HDL patients. Interestingly, incomplete penetrance of the 46 
      CAA/CAG repeat in the TBP gene was observed in a 59-year-old transmitting, but 
      healthy, parent. Furthermore, we report a new configuration of the expanded TBP 
      allele, with 11 repeats on the first polymorphic stretch of CAGs. Expansions in 
      the DRPLA gene and insertions in the PRNP gene were not found in our group of 
      patients. Further genetic heterogeneity of the HDL phenotype therefore exists.

TI  - Is the 31 CAG repeat allele of the spinocerebellar ataxia 1 (SCA1) gene locus 
      non-specifically associated with trinucleotide expansion diseases?
PG  - 201-5
AB  - A number of human hereditary neuromuscular and neurodegenerative disorders are 
      caused by the expansion of trinucleotide repeats within certain genes. The 
      molecular mechanisms that underlie these expansions are not yet known. We have 
      analyzed six trinucleotide repeat-containing loci [spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA1, 
      SCA3, SCA8), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), Huntington chorea (HD) 
      and fragile X syndrome (FRAXA)] in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) patients (n = 
      52). As controls, we analyzed two groups of subjects: healthy control subjects (n 
      =133), and a group of patients with non-triplet neuromuscular diseases (n = 68) 
      caused by point mutations, deletions or duplications (spinal muscular atrophy, 
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 1A, hereditary neuropathy with liability to 
      pressure palsies, and Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy). Allele frequency 
      distributions for all tested loci were similar in these three groups with the 
      exception of the SCA1 locus. In DM1 patients, the SCA1 allele with 31 CAG repeats 
      account for 40.4% of all chromosomes tested, which is significantly higher than 
      in two other groups (11.3% in healthy controls and 6.6% in the group of 
      non-triplet diseased patients; P < 0.001, Fisher's exact test). This is 
      consistent with our previous findings in HD patients. The absence of this 
      association in non-triplet diseases as well as in healthy controls could indicate 
      a possible role of this SCA1 allele with 31 repeats in triplet diseases. Here we 
      discuss a possible role of the SCA1 region in pathological trinucleotide repeat 
      expansions.

TI  - Neuronal nuclear alterations in dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy: 
      ultrastructural and morphometric studies of the cerebellar granule cells.
PG  - 12-9
AB  - Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is an autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG repeat expansion, resulting in 
      ubiquitinated inclusions and diffuse accumulation of mutant atrophin-1 in the 
      neuronal nuclei in many regions of the central nervous system. In the cerebellar 
      cortex, such nuclear abnormalities occur in the granule cells. In the present 
      study, we performed ultrastructural and morphometric analyses on the nuclei of 
      the cerebellar granule cells from eight patients with DRPLA (four with 
      juvenile-onset disease and four with adult-onset disease) in an attempt to obtain 
      further insight into the neuronal nuclear alterations that occur in CAG-repeat 
      diseases. Ultrastructurally, all patients had intranuclear filamentous inclusions 
      (NIIs, neuronal intranuclear inclusions) and nuclear membrane indentations (NMIs) 
      in some of their granule cells, and chromatin tended to be sparse in the 
      nucleoplasm of the affected nuclei. No such changes were observed in the granule 
      cells of four control subjects. In all patients there was an association between 
      NIIs and NMIs, and nuclei with NIIs and/or NMIs were larger than those without 
      such changes. However, the nuclear enlargement was not due solely to the NIIs - 
      even nuclei without NIIs or NMIs were larger in the patients than in the 
      controls. In the DRPLA patients, there was a significant inverse correlation 
      between the cross-sectional area of the nuclei and the disease duration. These 
      findings indicate that NIIs and NMIs are features in the disease and occur in 
      association with each other, and that nuclear enlargement - the degree of which 
      may decrease with time after onset of the illness - is a more prevalent 
      abnormality than the formation of NIIs or NMIs.

TI  - Single cell analysis of CAG repeat in brains of dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA).
PG  - 87-93
AB  - Somatic mosaicism of an expanded repeat is present in tissues of patients with 
      triplet repeat diseases. Of the spinocerebellar ataxias associated with triplet 
      repeat expansion, the most prominent heterogeneity of the expanded repeat is seen 
      in dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). The common feature of this 
      somatic mosaicism is the difference in the repeat numbers found in the cerebellum 
      as compared to other tissues. The expanded allele in the cerebellum shows a 
      smaller degree of expansion. We previously showed by microdissection analysis 
      that the expanded allele in the granular layer in DRPLA cerebellum has less 
      expansion than expanded alleles in the molecular layer and white matter. Whether 
      this feature of lesser expansion in granule cells is common to other types of 
      neurons is yet to be clarified. We used a newly developed excimer laser 
      microdissection system to analyze somatic mosaicism in the brains of two 
      patients, one with early- and another with late-onset DRPLA, and used single cell 
      PCR to observe the cell-to-cell differences in repeat numbers. In the late onset 
      patient, repeat expansion was more prominent in Purkinje cells than in granule 
      cells, but less than that in the glial cells. In the early onset patient, repeat 
      expansion in Purkinje cells was greater than in granule cells but did not differ 
      from that in glial cells. These findings suggest that there is a difference in 
      repeat expansion among neuronal subgroups and that the number of cell division 
      cycles is not the only determinant of somatic mosaicism.

TI  - Widespread occurrence of intranuclear atrophin-1 accumulation in the central 
      nervous system neurons of patients with dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy.
PG  - 14-23
AB  - Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is an autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion. In the present study 
      of DRPLA, we have demonstrated immunohistochemically that diffuse accumulation of 
      mutant atrophin-1 in the neuronal nuclei, rather than the formation of neuronal 
      intranuclear inclusions (NIIs), was the predominant pathologic condition and 
      involved a wide range of central nervous system regions far beyond the systems 
      previously reported to be affected. In the neuronal nuclei harboring NIIs, 
      promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies were redistributed into a 
      single NII, and the CREB (cAMP-responsive element-binding protein)-binding 
      protein was also recruited into NIIs. The results suggest that the novel lesion 
      distribution revealed by the diffuse nuclear labeling may be responsible for a 
      variety of clinical features, such as dementia and epilepsy in DRPLA, and that 
      certain transcriptional abnormalities may be induced secondarily in neuronal 
      nuclei with the formation of NIIs.

TI  - Analysis of CAG repeats in SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7 and DRPLA loci in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia patients and distribution of CAG repeats at the SCA1, SCA2 
      and SCA6 loci in nine ethnic populations of eastern India.
PG  - 597-604
AB  - To identify various subtypes of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) among 57 unrelated 
      individuals clinically diagnosed as ataxia patients we analysed the SCA1, SCA2, 
      SCA3, SCA6, SCA7 and DRPLA loci for expansion of CAG repeats. We detected CAG 
      repeat expansion in 6 patients (10.5%) at the SCA1 locus. Ten of the 57 patients 
      (17.5%) had CAG repeat expansion at the SCA2 locus, while four had CAG expansion 
      at the SCA3/MJD locus (7%). At the SCA6 locus there was a single patient (1.8%) 
      with 21 CAG repeats. We have not detected any patient with expansion in the SCA7 
      and DRPLA loci. To test whether the frequencies of the large normal alleles in 
      SCA1, SCA2 and SCA6 loci can reflect some light on prevalence of the subtypes of 
      SCAs we studied the CAG repeat variation in these loci in nine ethnic 
      sub-populations of eastern India from which the patients originated. We report 
      here that the frequency of large normal alleles (>31 CAG repeats) in SCA1 locus 
      to be 0.211 of 394 chromosomes studied. We also report that the frequency of 
      large normal alleles (>22 CAG repeats) at the SCA2 locus is 0.038 while at the 
      SCA6 locus frequency of large normal alleles (>13 repeats) is 0.032. We discussed 
      our data in light of the distribution of normal alleles and prevalence of SCAs in 
      the Japanese and white populations.

TI  - Frequency of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, SCA6, SCA7, and DRPLA CAG trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion in patients with hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia from Chinese 
      kindreds.
PG  - 540-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency of SCA1 (spinocerebellar ataxia type 1), SCA2, 
      SCA3/MJD (spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado-Joseph disease), SCA6, SCA7, and 
      DRPLA (dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy) CAG trinucleotide repeat expansions 
      [(CAG)n] among persons diagnosed with hereditary SCA from Chinese families. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, SCA6, SCA7, 
      and DRPLA (CAG)n mutation were detected with the polymerase chain reaction, 
      highly denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and silver staining 
      technique in 167 patients with autosomal dominant SCA from 85 Chinese families 
      and 37 patients with sporadic SCA. RESULTS: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (CAG)n 
      mutation in 7 patients from 4 kindreds (4.70%) was expanded to 53 to 62 repeats. 
      Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (CAG)n mutation in 12 patients from 5 kindreds 
      (5.88%) was expanded to 42 to 47 repeats. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      3/Machado-Joseph disease (CAG)n mutation in 83 patients from 41 kindreds (48.23%) 
      was expanded to 68 to 83 repeats. Sixty-five patients from 35 kindreds (41.19%) 
      and 37 patients with sporadic SCA did not test positive for SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, 
      SCA6, SCA7, or DRPLA. There was a predictable inverse relationship between the 
      number of CAG repeats and the age at onset for SCA3/MJD and SCA2. Clinically, 
      dementia and hyporeflexia were more frequent in patients with SCA2, while 
      spasticity, hyperreflexia, and Babinski signs were more frequent in patients with 
      SCA3/ MJD, and those might be helpful in clinical work to primarily distinguish 
      patients with SCA3/MJD and SCA2 from others with different types of SCA. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of SCA3/MJD is substantially higher than that of SCA1 
      and SCA2 in patients with autosomal dominant SCA from Chinese kindreds, who are 
      non-Portuguese. Clinical expressions of the various types of SCAs overlap one 
      another; therefore, for clinical study it is important to make a gene diagnosis 
      and genetic classification for patients with SCA.

TI  - Absence of unidentified CAG repeat expansion in patients with Huntington's 
      disease-like phenotype.
PG  - 672-5
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by an expanded (CAG)n repeat on the huntingtin gene. It is characterised 
      by motor, psychiatric and cognitive disturbances. Diagnosis can be confirmed by 
      direct genetic testing, which is highly sensitive and specific and is now 
      considered definitive. This study focused on 21 patients presenting with a 
      clinical phenotype showing strong similarity to HD, but who do not have an 
      expanded CAG in the huntingtin gene. However, other possible diagnoses could be 
      evoked for most of them. Seven patients (3.5% of our cohort) could be considered 
      as phenocopies of HD with no alternative diagnosis. Samples were screened for 
      other triplet repeat diseases with similar presentation (DRPLA, SCA-1, SCA-2, 
      SCA-3, SCA-6, and SCA-7) and were all negative. The repeat expansion detection 
      technique (RED) was used to detect uncloned CAG repeat expansions and samples 
      were also analysed by polymerase chain reaction for expansions of the polymorphic 
      CAG-ERDA-1 and CTG18.1 trinucleotide repeats. RED expansion (>40 repeats) was 
      detected in only one patient. The results suggest that unstable CAG/CTG repeat 
      expansions corresponding to known or unknown sequences are not involved in the 
      aetiology of HD-like disorders. It is hypothesised that some of these phenocopies 
      could correspond to mutations in other unidentified genes with other unstable 
      repeats (different from CAG) or in unknown genes with other mutations.

TI  - Nuclear accumulation of truncated atrophin-1 fragments in a transgenic mouse 
      model of DRPLA.
PG  - 275-86
AB  - Dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is a member of a family of 
      progressive neurodegenerative diseases caused by polyglutamine repeat expansion. 
      Transgenic mice expressing full-length human atrophin-1 with 65 consecutive 
      glutamines exhibit ataxia, tremors, abnormal movements, seizures, and premature 
      death. These mice accumulate atrophin-1 immunoreactivity and inclusion bodies in 
      the nuclei of multiple populations of neurons. Subcellular fractionation revealed 
      120 kDa nuclear fragments of mutant atrophin-1, whose abundance increased with 
      age and phenotypic severity. Brains of DRPLA patients contained apparently 
      identical 120 kDa nuclear fragments. By contrast, mice overexpressing atrophin-1 
      with 26 glutamines were phenotypically normal and did not accumulate the 120 kDa 
      fragments. We conclude that the evolution of neuropathology in DRPLA involves 
      proteolytic processing of mutant atrophin-1 and nuclear accumulation of truncated 
      fragments.

TI  - Differences in evoked potential characteristics between DRPLA patients and 
      patients with progressive myoclonic epilepsy: preliminary findings indicating 
      usefulness for differential diagnosis.
PG  - 3-11
AB  - The characteristics of evoked potentials in patients with 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) were investigated. Twelve patients 
      with DRPLA and three patients with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME) 
      attributable to other causes participated in the study. In 11 out of the 12 
      patients, the diagnosis of DRPLA was genetically confirmed, based on a 56-75 CAG 
      triplet repeat expansion on chromosome 12p; in the remaining patient, the 
      diagnosis was not genetically confirmed but the patient was clinically diagnosed 
      as having DRPLA and was within the same pedigree as one of the 11 genetically 
      confirmed patients. Two out of the three patients with PME, who had been tested 
      for dodecamer repeat expansion in the cystatin B gene, were genetically confirmed 
      as having Unverricht-Lundborg disease (UL); the remaining patient was also 
      clinically diagnosed as having UL, but the patient did not have the 
      aforementioned genetic abnormality. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and 
      brainstem auditory evoked responses (BAERs) were recorded. The amplitudes of the 
      SEPs were determined as the peak-to-peak amplitudes between P2 and N2 
      deflections. The results revealed that high-amplitude SEPs were not evoked in any 
      of the DRPLA patients; on the other hand, high-amplitude SEPs were evoked in all 
      the patients with UL. Moreover, BAERs were absent in seven out of the 12 patients 
      with DRPLA; on the other hand, all UL patients showed BAERs in which all peaks, 
      from I to V, were distinguishable. These results suggest differences in 
      pathophysiology between DRPLA, which predominantly affects the brainstem and 
      subcortical regions, and PME, characterized by cortical hyperexcitability. Thus, 
      evoked potential measurements may be useful to differentiate DRPLA patients from 
      those with progressive myoclonic epilepsy.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxias in Spanish patients: genetic analysis of familial and 
      sporadic cases. The Ataxia Study Group.
PG  - 516-22
AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) are a clinically heterogeneous group 
      of neurodegenerative disorders caused by unstable CAG repeat expansions encoding 
      polyglutamine tracts. Five spinocerebellar ataxia genes (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 
      and SCA7) and another related dominant ataxia gene (DRPLA) have been cloned, 
      allowing the genetic classification of these disorders. We present here the 
      molecular analysis of 87 unrelated familial and 60 sporadic Spanish cases of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia. For ADCA cases 15% were SCA2, 15% SCA3, 6% SCA1, 3% SCA7, 
      1% SCA6 and 1% DRPLA, an extremely rare mutation in Caucasoid populations. About 
      58% of ADCA cases remained genetically unclassified. All the SCA1 cases belong to 
      the same geographical area and share a common haplotype for the SCA1 mutation. 
      The expanded alleles ranged from 41 to 59 repeats for SCA1, 35 to 46 [corrected] 
      for SCA2, 67 to 77 for SCA3, and 38 to 113 for SCA7. One SCA6 case had 25 repeats 
      and one DRPLA case had 63 repeats. The highest CAG repeat variation in meiotic 
      transmission of expanded alleles was detected in SCA7, this being of +67 units in 
      one paternal transmission and giving rise to a 113 CAG repeat allele in a patient 
      who died at 3 years of age. Meiotic transmissions have also shown a tendency to 
      more frequent paternal transmission of expanded alleles in SCA1 and maternal in 
      SCA7. All SCA1 and SCA2 expanded alleles analyzed consisted of pure CAG repeats, 
      whereas normal alleles were interrupted by 1-2 CAT trinucleotides in SCA1, except 
      for three alleles of 6, 14 and 21 CAG repeats, and by 1-3 CAA trinucleotides in 
      SCA2. No SCA or DRPLA mutations were detected in the 60 sporadic cases of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia, but one late onset patient was identified as a recessive 
      form due to GAA-repeat expansions in the Friedreich's ataxia gene.

TI  - Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy protein interacts through a proline-rich 
      region near polyglutamine with the SH3 domain of an insulin receptor tyrosine 
      kinase substrate.
PG  - 947-57
AB  - Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is an autosomal dominant neuro 
      degrees enerative disorder associated with CAG/glutamine repeat expansion. While 
      the DRPLA gene is ubiquitously expressed, neuron death occurs in specific 
      anatomical areas of the brain. This predicts that the DRPLA protein interacts 
      with other proteins and that these interactions may play a role in pathogenesis. 
      Here, we describe a protein that binds to the DRPLA product. One of the clones 
      isolated with a yeast two-hybrid system was identified as a human homolog of the 
      insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate protein of 53 kDa (IRSp53). The gene 
      produced two mRNA forms by differential splicing and encoded 552 and 521 amino 
      acids, respectively. The longer form was mainly expressed in the brain and the 
      shorter one in other tissues. The products were phosphorylated upon stimulation 
      of cultured cells with insulin or insulin-like growth factor 1. Binding of the 
      DRPLA protein to IRSp53 was ascertained by co-immunoprecipitation with antibodies 
      and also by co-localization in perinuclear oval dots in cells expressing 
      engineered constructs. A proline-rich region near the polyglutamine tract of the 
      DRPLA protein and the SH3 domain of IRSp53 were involved in the binding. An 
      extended polyglutamine tract significantly reduced binding ability in yeast 
      cells, but not in in vitro binding assays. The identification of IRSp53 and other 
      proteins detected by the yeast hybrid system predicts that DRPLA functions in a 
      signal transduction pathway coupled with insulin/IGF-1.

TI  - Cleavage of atrophin-1 at caspase site aspartic acid 109 modulates cytotoxicity.
PG  - 8730-6
AB  - Dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is one of eight autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disorders characterized by an abnormal CAG repeat expansion 
      which results in the expression of a protein with a polyglutamine stretch of 
      excessive length. We have reported recently that four of the gene products 
      (huntingtin, atrophin-1 (DRPLA), ataxin-3, and androgen receptor) associated with 
      these open reading frame triplet repeat expansions are substrates for the 
      cysteine protease cell death executioners, the caspases. This led us to 
      hypothesize that caspase cleavage of these proteins may represent a common step 
      in the pathogenesis of each of these four neurodegenerative diseases. Here we 
      present evidence that caspase cleavage of atrophin-1 modulates cytotoxicity and 
      aggregate formation. Cleavage of atrophin-1 at Asp109 by caspases is critical for 
      cytotoxicity because a mutant atrophin-1 that is resistant to caspase cleavage is 
      associated with significantly decreased toxicity. Further, the altered cellular 
      localization within the nucleus and aggregate formation associated with the 
      expanded form of atrophin-1 are completely suppressed by mutation of the caspase 
      cleavage site at Asp109. These results provide support for the toxic fragment 
      hypothesis whereby cleavage of atrophin-1 by caspases may be an important step in 
      the pathogenesis of DRPLA. Therefore, inhibiting caspase cleavage of the 
      polyglutamine-containing proteins may be a feasible therapeutic strategy to 
      prevent cell death.

TI  - Transgenic mice harboring a full-length human mutant DRPLA gene exhibit 
      age-dependent intergenerational and somatic instabilities of CAG repeats 
      comparable with those in DRPLA patients.
PG  - 99-106
AB  - Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is one among an increasing number of 
      hereditary neurodegenerative diseases determined as being caused by unstable 
      expansion of CAG repeats coding for polyglutamine stretches. To investigate the 
      molecular mechanisms underlying CAG repeat instability, we established three 
      transgenic lines each harboring a single copy of a full-length human mutant DRPLA 
      gene carrying a CAG repeat expansion. These transgenic mice exhibited an 
      age-dependent increase (+0.31 per year) in male transmission and an age-dependent 
      contraction (-1.21 per year) in female transmission. Similar tendencies in 
      intergenerational instabilities were also observed in human DRPLA 
      parent-offspring pairs. The intergenerational instabilities of the CAG repeats 
      may be interpreted as being derived from the instability occurring during 
      continuous cell division of spermatogonia in the male, and that occurring during 
      the period of meiotic arrest in the female. The transgenic mice also exhibited an 
      age-dependent increase in the degree of somatic mosaicism which occurred in a 
      cell lineage-dependent manner, with the size range of CAG repeats being smaller 
      in the cerebellum than in other tissues including the cerebrum, consistent with 
      observations in autopsied tissues of DRPLA patients. Thus, the transgenic mice 
      described in this study exhibited age-dependent intergenerational as well as 
      somatic instabilities of expanded CAG repeats comparable with those observed in 
      human DRPLA patients, and are therefore expected to serve as good models for 
      investigating the molecular mechanisms of instabilities of CAG repeats.

TI  - Close associations between prevalences of dominantly inherited spinocerebellar 
      ataxias with CAG-repeat expansions and frequencies of large normal CAG alleles in 
      Japanese and Caucasian populations.
PG  - 1060-6
AB  - To test the hypothesis that the frequencies of normal alleles (ANs) with a 
      relatively large number of CAG repeats (large ANs) are related to the prevalences 
      of the dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs)-SCA types 1, 2, 3 (Machado-Joseph 
      disease), 6, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA)-we investigated the 
      relative prevalences of these diseases in 202 Japanese and 177 Caucasian families 
      and distributions of the number of CAG repeats of ANs at these disease loci in 
      normal individuals in each population. The relative prevalences of SCA1 and SCA2 
      were significantly higher in Caucasian pedigrees (15% and 14%, respectively) than 
      in Japanese pedigrees (3% and 5%, respectively), corresponding to the observation 
      that the frequencies of large ANs of SCA1 (alleles >30 repeats) and of SCA2 
      (alleles >22 repeats) were significantly higher in Caucasians than in Japanese. 
      The relative prevalences of MJD/SCA3, SCA6, and DRPLA were significantly higher 
      in Japanese pedigrees (43%, 11%, and 20%, respectively) than in Caucasian 
      pedigrees (30%, 5%, and 0%, respectively), corresponding to the observation that 
      the frequencies of large ANs of MJD/SCA3 (>27 repeats), SCA6 (>13 repeats), and 
      DRPLA (>17 repeats) were significantly higher in Japanese than in Caucasians. The 
      close correlations of the relative prevalences of the dominant SCAs with the 
      distributions of large ANs strongly support the assumption that large ANs 
      contribute to generation of expanded alleles (AEs) and the relative prevalences 
      of the dominant SCAs.

TI  - Intracellular aggregate formation of dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) 
      protein with the extended polyglutamine.
PG  - 96-102
AB  - Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is an autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by the abnormal CAG triplet-repeat expansion 
      resulting in an elongated polyglutamine (polyQ) stretch. We have recently showed 
      that the DRPLA protein is cleaved during apoptosis by caspase-3, one of the 
      cysteine protease family members known to be activated during apoptosis. We 
      report here the subcellular localization of the DRPLA protein by fusing the green 
      fluorescent protein as a tag. The full length DRPLA protein is localized 
      predominantly but not exclusively in the nucleus regardless of the length of the 
      polyQ stretch. In contrast, an N-terminal-deleted fragment containing polyQ 
      produced by the proteolytic cleavage with caspase-3 is found both in the nucleus 
      and the cytoplasm. Moreover, the same fragment with the elongated polyQ showed 
      aggregation when overexpressed. Some cells with aggregate formation showed 
      apoptotic phenotype. These findings raise the possibility that the DRPLA protein 
      processed by caspase-3 may lead to aggregation of the protein resulting in the 
      development of neurodegeneration.

TI  - CAG repeat expansions in patients with sporadic cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 55-9
AB  - CAG repeat expansions cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), SCA2, SCA3, 
      SCA6 and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). So far these expansions 
      have been examined mainly in ataxia patients with a family history. However, some 
      sporadic cases with SCA have recently been reported. To elucidate the frequency 
      and characteristics of sporadic SCAs, we screened 85 Japanese ataxia patients 
      without a family history for the SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 and DRPLA mutations. As a 
      result, 19 patients (22%) were found to have expanded CAG repeats. Among sporadic 
      SCAs, the SCA6 mutation was most frequently observed. The sporadic SCA6 patients 
      had smaller CAG repeats and a later age of onset than SCA6 patients with an 
      established family history. We also identified one father-child pair in which 
      intermediate sized CAG repeats expanded into the SCA2 disease range during 
      transmission. These findings suggest that patients with ataxia even without a 
      family history should be examined for a CAG repeat expansion.

TI  - Atrophin-1, the DRPLA gene product, interacts with two families of WW 
      domain-containing proteins.
PG  - 149-60
AB  - Atrophin-1 contains a polyglutamine repeat, expansion of which is responsible for 
      dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). The normal function of 
      atrophin-1 is unknown. We have identified five atrophin-1 interacting proteins 
      (AIPs) which bind to atrophin-1 in the vicinity of the polyglutamine tract using 
      the yeast two-hybrid system. Four of the interactions were confirmed using in 
      vitro binding assays. All five interactors contained multiple WW domains. Two are 
      novel. The AIPs can be divided into two distinct classes. AIP1 and AIP3/WWP3 are 
      MAGUK-like multidomain proteins containing a number of protein-protein 
      interaction modules, namely a guanylate kinase-like region, two WW domains, and 
      multiple PDZ domains. AIP2/WWP2, AIP4, and AIP5/WWP1 are highly homologous, each 
      having four WW domains and a HECT domain characteristic of ubiquitin ligases. 
      These interactors are similar to recently isolated huntingtin-interacting 
      proteins, suggesting possible commonality of function between two proteins 
      responsible for very similar diseases.

TI  - Uncloned expanded CAG/CTG repeat sequences in autosomal dominant cerebellar 
      ataxia (ADCA) detected by the repeat expansion detection (RED) method.
PG  - 99-102
AB  - In some neurodegenerative diseases, genetic anticipation correlates with 
      expansions of the CAG/CTG repeat sequence above the normal range through the 
      generations of a pedigree. Among these neurodegenerative diseases are late onset 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA). ADCA are genetically heterogeneous 
      disorders with different cloned genes for spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), 
      type 2 (SCA2), type 3 or Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD), and type 6 (SCA6). 
      Another related dominant ataxia, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), 
      also shows CAG/CTG repeat expansions. Genetic anticipation has been reported for 
      all of them except for the recently cloned SCA6 gene. Other, as yet undetected 
      SCA genes may show the same features. We have used the repeat expansion detection 
      (RED) method to detect repeat expansions directly in DNA samples from ADCA 
      patients not resulting from known genes. Our sample consists of 19 affected index 
      cases, corresponding to 52.8% of our ADCA families without CAG/CTG repeat 
      expansions in the SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, SCA6, or DRPLA genes. Eighty-nine percent 
      of the index cases had expansions of a CAG/CTG sequence greater than 40 repeats 
      by RED, while these were observed in only 26.9% of 78 healthy subjects from the 
      general population (p < 0.0001). The distribution of RED fragments in controls 
      and ADCA patients also shows significant differences with the Mann-Whitney U test 
      (U = 376.5, p = 0.0007). Moreover, there was a significant inverse correlation 
      between the size of expansion and the age of onset (r = -0.54, p = 0.018). These 
      results show CAG/CTG repeat expansions of over 40 repeats in our sample of ADCA 
      families not resulting from known SCA genes.

TI  - Suppression of aggregate formation and apoptosis by transglutaminase inhibitors

PG  - 111-7
AB  - To elucidate the molecular mechanisms whereby expanded polyglutamine stretches 
      elicit a gain of toxic function, we expressed full-length and truncated DRPLA 
      (dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy) cDNAs with or without expanded CAG repeats 
      in COS-7 cells. We found that truncated DRPLA proteins containing an expanded 
      polyglutamine stretch form filamentous peri- and intranuclear aggregates and 
      undergo apoptosis. The apoptotic cell death was partially suppressed by the 
      transglutaminase inhibitors cystamine and monodansyl cadaverine (but not 
      putrescine), suggesting involvement of a transglutaminase reaction and providing 
      a potential basis for the development of therapeutic measures for CAG-repeat 
      expansion diseases.

      generations of a pedigree. Genetic heterogeneity has been demonstrated for ADCA, 
      with four cloned genes (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, and SCA6) and three mapped loci 
      (SCA4, SCA5 and SCA7). Another related dominant ataxia, 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), presents anticipation with CAG/CTG 
      repeat expansions. We had previously analysed ADCA patients who had not shown 
      repeat expansions in cloned genes for CAG/CTG repeat expansions by the repeat 
      expansion detection method (RED) and had detected expansions of between 48 and 88 
      units in 17 unrelated familial cases. We present here an analysis of 13 genes and 
      expressed sequence tags (ESTs) containing 10 or more CAG/CTG repeat sequences 
      selected from public databases in the 17 unrelated ADCA patients. Of the 13 
      selected genes and ESTs, 9 were found to be polymorphic with heterozygosities 
      ranging between 0.09 and 0.80 and 2 to 17 alleles. In ADCA patients none of the 
      loci showed expansions above the normal range of the CAG/CTG repeat sequences, 
      excluding them as the mutation causing ADCA.

      during apoptosis.
PG  - 29238-42
AB  - Dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is an autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disorder. It is associated with an abnormal CAG repeat 
      expansion resulting in formation of a protein with an elongated polyglutamine 
      stretch. However, neither the physiological roles of the DRPLA gene product nor 
      molecular mechanisms of its pathogenesis have yet been elucidated. Here we report 
      that the DRPLA protein is cleaved at a site near the N terminus during apoptosis 
      induced by VP-16, staurosporine, or glucocorticoid. Moreover, the in vitro 
      translated DRPLA protein is cleaved by recombinant caspase-3, a member of the 
      cysteine protease family, which is thought to be a main executioner of apoptosis. 
      Using mutant DRPLA proteins, the cleavage site was identified as 106DSLDG110. The 
      cleavage, however, was not modulated by the length of the polyglutamine stretch. 
      These findings suggest that the DRPLA protein is one of the physiological 
      substrates of caspase-3, and its cleavage may result in structural and 
      biochemical alterations associated with apoptosis.

AB  - In order to reveal the pathophysiology of photoparoxysmal responses (PPRs) in 
      photosensitive patients with hereditary dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy 
      (DRPLA) who had expansion of the CAG repeat in the DRPLA gene, we studied the 
      characteristics of PPRs using optical filters with specific wavelength 
      transmission. In two patients, the wavelength spectrum around 700 nm (670-720 nm) 
      was apparently the only visible range essential for eliciting PPRs, and flash 
      lights containing the essential wavelength elicited PPRs. In another patient, 
      PPRs were elicited by flash lights above certain quantity of light and 
      independent of the wavelength composition of the lights. These data suggest that 
      two different pathological conditions contribute to PPRs in DRPLA patients; one 
      condition depends on the essential wavelength spectrum around 700 nm, and the 
      other not on the wavelength, but on the quantity of light. The condition 
      contributing to PPRs in all three patients was not determined directly by the 
      level of the CAG repeat expansion in the DRPLA gene.

TI  - Brain regional differences in the expansion of a CAG repeat in the 
      spinocerebellar ataxias: dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, Machado-Joseph 
      disease, and spinocerebellar ataxia type 1.
PG  - 505-11
AB  - Three autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA), Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), and spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 
      (SCA1), are associated with the expansion of a CAG repeat in the respective 
      genes. To investigate the association between CAG repeat expansion and 
      neuropathological findings, we analyzed several brain regions from 9 cases of 
      DRPLA, 3 cases of MJD, and 1 case of SCA1. We found that the expanded alleles 
      were smaller in the cerebellar cortex than in other brain regions, such as the 
      frontal cortex, in these three diseases. The discrepancy in the expanded CAG 
      repeat length between cerebellar cortex and other tissues was most prominent in 
      DRPLA, and especially in cases of adult-onset DRPLA. A significant correlation 
      was found between the age at onset of DRPLA and the size of the CAG repeat 
      expansion. Cerebella of DRPLA patients were microscopically dissected into three 
      layers, the molecular and granular layers and the white matter, which were 
      analyzed separately. The lower level of CAG repeat expansion in DRPLA cerebella 
      was representative of CAG repeat expansion in the granule cells. The 
      microdissected samples of the granular layer of the hippocampal formation, which 
      is densely packed with neuronal cells, revealed that the degree of CAG repeat 
      expansion in this layer was similar to that in the cerebellum. These observations 
      suggest that granule cells in the cerebellum and hippocampus have low levels of 
      CAG repeat expansion, and that other types of cells exhibit a higher level of CAG 
      repeat expansion, in spinocerebellar ataxias.

TI  - The prevalence and wide clinical spectrum of the spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 
      trinucleotide repeat in patients with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 842-50
AB  - The dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) represent a clinically and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of disorders linked by progressive deterioration in balance 
      and coordination. The utility of genetic classification of the ADCAs has been 
      highlighted by the striking variability in clinical phenotype observed within 
      families and the overlap in clinical phenotype observed between those with 
      different genotypes. The recent demonstration that spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 
      (SCA2) is caused by a CAG repeat expansion within the ataxin-2 gene has allowed 
      us to determine the frequency of SCA2 compared with SCA1, SCA3/Machado-Joseph 
      disease (MJD), and dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) in patients with 
      sporadic and inherited ataxia. SCA2 accounts for 13% of patients with ADCA 
      (without retinal degeneration), intermediate between SCA1 and SCA3/MJD, which 
      account for 6% and 23%, respectively. Together, SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3/MJD 
      constitute >40% of the mutations leading to ADCA I in our population. No patient 
      without a family history of ataxia, or with a pure cerebellar or spastic 
      syndrome, tested positive for SCA1, SCA2, or SCA3. No overlap in ataxin-2 allele 
      size between normal and disease chromosomes, or intermediate-sized alleles, were 
      observed. Repeat length correlated inversely with age at onset, accounting for 
      approximately 80% of the variability in onset age. Haplotype analysis provided no 
      evidence for a single founder chromosome, and diverse ethnic origins were 
      observed among SCA2 kindreds. In addition, a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes 
      was observed among SCA2 patients, including typical mild dominant ataxia, the MJD 
      phenotype with facial fasciculations and lid retraction, and early-onset ataxia 
      with a rapid course, chorea, and dementia.

TI  - Southern analysis for detection of CAG repeat expansions associated with 
      dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy.
PG  - 354-6
AB  - Dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is an autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of an unstable, tandemly repeated 
      trinucleotide sequence, (CAG)n, in a novel gene on human chromosome 12p12-pter. 
      Molecular diagnosis of DRPLA uses the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify 
      and characterize the number of CAG repeats carried by individuals. The PCR 
      analysis is fairly straightforward when two alleles are identified. However, when 
      only a single allele is observed, it is difficult to know whether the sample is 
      homozygous or whether there was failure to amplify the second allele. We describe 
      a Southern analysis for detection of the DRPLA CAG repeat, providing an 
      independent method for the assessment of expanded alleles.

TI  - Non-Mendelian transmission in dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy and 
      Machado-Joseph disease: the mutant allele is preferentially transmitted in male 
      meiosis.
PG  - 730-3
AB  - Autosomal dominant dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) and 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) are neurodegenerative disorders caused by CAG 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions. An inverse correlation of age at onset with the 
      length of the expanded CAG trinucleotide repeats has been demonstrated, and the 
      intergenerational instability of the length of the CAG trinucleotide repeats, 
      which is more prominent in paternal than in maternal transmissions, has been 
      shown to underlie the basic mechanisms of anticipation in DRPLA and MJD. Our 
      previous observations on DRPLA and MJD pedigrees, as well as a review of the 
      literature, have suggested that the numbers of affected offspring exceed those of 
      unaffected offspring, which is difficult to explain by the Mendelian principle of 
      random segregation of alleles. In the present study, we analyzed the segregation 
      patterns in 211 transmissions in 24 DRPLA pedigrees and 80 transmissions in 7 MJD 
      pedigrees, with the diagnoses confirmed by molecular testing. Significant 
      distortions in favor of transmission of the mutant alleles were found in male 
      meiosis, where the mutant alleles were transmitted to 62% of all offspring in 
      DRPLA (chi2 = 7.69; P<.01) and 73% in MJD (chi2 = 6.82; P<.01). The results were 
      consistent with meiotic drive in DRPLA and MJD. Since more prominent meiotic 
      instability of the length of the CAG trinucleotide repeats is observed in male 
      meiosis than in female meiosis and meiotic drive is observed only in male 
      meiosis, these results raise the possibility that a common molecular mechanism 
      underlies the meiotic drive and the meiotic instability in male meiosis.

TI  - A unique origin and multistep process for the generation of expanded DRPLA 
      triplet repeats.
PG  - 373-9
AB  - Dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is an autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disorder associated with the expansion of a CAG repeat at 
      chromosome band 12p13. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated an increased 
      prevalence of DRPLA in Japan, although several DRPLA kindreds of non-Japanese 
      ancestry have been identified. To define the molecular basis for this geographic 
      variation in prevalence, we have analyzed haplotypes around the repeat in several 
      different ethnic groups. Two intragenic biallelic polymorphisms distinguished 
      three haplotypes, each of which formed a predominant haplotype found in the three 
      major racial populations. All the expanded repeats of Japanese and Caucasian 
      patients studied were associated with a particular haplotype, which otherwise was 
      associated with longer repeats commonly found in Asians. Our results support a 
      multi-step model for repeat expansion, and suggest that expanded DRPLA repeats 
      may have evolved from an ancient chromosomal haplotype of Asian origin. We also 
      propose that a combination of a highly polymorphic microsatellite marker with 
      relatively stable biallelic markers in a range of PCR amplification is a powerful 
      tool for studies on human genome diversity, which may reveal the ancient human 
      migration and the formation of ethnic groups.

TI  - Differential pattern in tissue-specific somatic mosaicism of expanded CAG

PG  - 43-50
AB  - We investigated the somatic mosaicism of trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 
      neural and nonneural tissues of a dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) 
      patient and their correlation to the topographical distribution of the 
      pathological involvement. The spatial pattern of tissue-specific somatic 
      mosaicism in the CAG repeat size was significantly different among the DRPLA, MJD 
      and SBMA patients. The size of the major bands of the mutant CAG repeat allele 
      was significantly smaller in the cerebellar cortex in both DRPLA and MJD patients 
      by 6 and 2 repeat units respectively and larger in the colon and liver of DRPLA 
      by 5 repeats or more. There were also 1-2 repeat-sized small variations of major 
      band size among the neural tissues in DRPLA. In contrast, there was no 
      tissue-specific variation of major bands of CAG repeats and diversity of extra 
      bands among the examined tissues including the cerebellum in the SBMA patient. 
      There was no parallel occurrence of tissue-specific CAG instability and severity 
      of neuropathological involvement in the neural and nonneural tissues of DRPLA, 
      MJD and SBMA patients. Lack of significant tissue-specific somatic mosaicism in 
      SBMA including the cerebellar cortex may suggest that CAG repeat expansion in the 
      mutant androgen receptor gene is far more stable compared with that in DRPLA and 
      MJD as well as those reported in Huntington's disease.

TI  - Frequency of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy, 
      and Machado-Joseph disease mutations in a large group of spinocerebellar ataxia 
      patients.
PG  - 214-8
AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      disorders varying in both clinical manifestations and mode of inheritance. Six 
      different genes causing autosomal dominant SCA are mapped: SCA1, SCA2, 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)/SCA3, SCA4, SCA5, and dentatorubropallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA). Expansions of an unstable trinucleotide CAG repeat cause three 
      of these disorders: SCA type 1 (SCA1), MJD, and DRPLA. We determine the frequency 
      of the SCA1, DRPLA, and MJD mutations in a large group of unrelated SCA patients 
      with various patterns of inheritance and different ethnic backgrounds. We studied 
      92 unrelated SCA patients. The frequency of the SCA1 mutation was 3% in the 
      overall patient group and 10% in the non-Portuguese dominantly inherited SCA 
      subgroup. We found that DRPLA mutation in only one Japanese patient, who was 
      previously diagnosed with this disease. We identified the MJD mutation in 41% of 
      the overall patient group, which included 38 autosomal dominant kindreds of 
      Portuguese origin; the frequency of the MJD mutation among the non-Portuguese 
      dominantly inherited cases was 17%. These results suggest that SCA may be 
      occasionally caused by the SCA1 mutation and rarely caused by the DRPLA mutation 
      and that, to date, the MJD mutation seems to be the most common cause of 
      dominantly inherited SCA. Finally, our results suggest that recessively inherited 
      cases of SCA are not caused by the known trinucleotide repeat expansions.

TI  - Molecular re-investigation of patients with Huntington's disease in Wessex 
      reveals a family with dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy.
PG  - 76-8
AB  - Dentatorubral and pallidolysian atrophy (DRPLA), a neurological disorder thought 
      to be rare in European populations, is caused by a triplet repeat expansion in 
      the B37 gene on chromosome 12. This disorder can phenotypically mimic 
      Huntington's disease (HD) which is also caused by a repeat expansion. We have 
      analysed 139 affected individuals for the HD triplet repeat expansion and found 
      132 patients had one normal and one expanded allele. Two patients had an 
      expansion on both chromosomes and five patients had two normal-size alleles. Of 
      these five patients, two were considered to be atypical Two patients who were 
      father and daughter were found to have an expansion of the DRPLA triplet repeat. 
      This therefore constitutes the second such family described in the United 
      Kingdom.

TI  - Structure and expression of the gene responsible for the triplet repeat disorder, 
      dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA).
PG  - 177-82
AB  - Dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy is associated with expansion of an 
      unstable CAG repeat on chromosome 12p. We have determined the nucleotide 
      sequences of overlapping cDNA clones and deduced the gene structure. The gene is 
      ubiquitously expressed to form a single 4.5 kb transcript and encoded by an open 
      reading frame of 1184 amino acids (aa), in which a polyglutamine track with 
      variable length starts at aa 484. Although the predicted amino acid sequence does 
      not reveal any function, it does contain several interesting motifs consisting of 
      a simple repeated amino acid sequence, a homo-proline track, two stretches of 
      arginine-glutamic acid dipeptides and a stretch of alternative histidine 
      residues. These results provide clues toward understanding neurodegenerative 
      diseases associated with triplet repeat expansion.

TI  - Unstable expansion of CAG repeat in hereditary dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA).
PG  - 9-13
AB  - Hereditary dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is an autosomal dominant 
      neurologic disorder characterized by variable combinations of myoclonus, 
      epilepsy, cerebellar ataxia, choreoathetosis and dementia. By specifically 
      searching published brain cDNA sequences for the presence of CAG repeats we 
      identified unstable expansion of a CAG in a gene on chromosome 12 in all the 22 
      DRPLA patients examined. A good correlation between the size of the CAG repeat 
      expansion and the ages of disease onset is found in this group. Patients with 
      earlier onset tended to have a phenotype of progressive myoclonus epilepsy and 
      larger expansions. We propose that the wide variety of clinical manifestations of 
      DRPLA can now be explained by the variable unstable expansion of the CAG repeat.

TI  - Triplet repeats in clinical subtypes of schizophrenia: variation at the DRPLA (B 
      37 CAG repeat) locus is not associated with periodic catatonia.
PG  - 153-7
AB  - Clinical evidence for a dominant mode of inheritance and anticipation in periodic 
      catatonia, a distinct subtype of schizophrenia, indicates that genes with triplet 
      repeat expansions or other unstable repetitive elements affecting gene expression 
      may be involved in the etiology of this disorder. Because patients affected with 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) may present with "schizophrenic" 
      symptoms, we have investigated the DRPLA (B 37 CAG repeat) locus on chromosome 12 
      in 41 patients with periodic catatonia. The B 37 CAG repeat locus was highly 
      polymorphic but all alleles in both the patient and control group had repeat 
      sizes within the normal range. We conclude that variation at the DRPLA locus is 
      unlikely to be associated with periodic catatonia. The evidence for dominant 
      inheritance and anticipation as well as the high prevalence of human brain genes 
      containing trinucleotide repeats justifies further screening for triplet repeat 
      expansions in periodic catatonia.
